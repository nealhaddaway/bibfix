TI  - Effect of plough pan thickness on crop growth parameters, nitrogen uptake and greenhouse gas (CO2 and N2O) emissions in a wheat-maize double-crop rotation in the Northern China Plain: A one-year study
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Plough pan can affect crop growth, nutrient uptake and the fates of substances in the environment. To determine the effects of plough pan thickness on crop and environment, a field survey and a field experiment were conducted on a typical calcareous fluvo-aquic soil in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in Northern China Plain from 2014 to 2016. Specifically, the thickness of plough pans was surveyed in 108 field plots in 2014, and then based on the survey results a field experiment was established to study the effects of different plough pan thicknesses (PP15: 15 cm of plough pan; PP10: 10 cm of plough pan; PP5: 5 cm of plough pan; PP0: 0 cm of plough pan) on crop growth, nitrogen (N) utilization and the environment. The survey showed that the thickness of topsoil averaged at 14.7 cm, and the plough pan was approximately 15 cm deep. The plough pan was found at 76% of the survey locations, and it was distributed commonly from 15 to 30 cm beneath the soil surface. Breaking the original plough pan partially or completely could promote the net photosynthesis rate, leaf water use efficiency, crop yield, and N use efficiency, decrease N2O emission, but increase CO2 emission. Among all treatments, breaking plough pans completely (PP0) and by 2/3 (PP5) resulted in best crop performance, whose photosynthetic parameters (especially net photosynthetic rate and leaf water use efficiency) were significantly higher than PP10 and PP15. For both wheat and maize, PP5 resulted in greater yield (7 130 kg ha−1 for wheat and 8 240 kg ha−1 for maize) than other treatments. Although it did not differ with PP0 significantly, PP5 had significantly higher N uptake (410 kg ha−1) and N use efficiency (40.1%) than PP10 and PP15. The magnitude of N2O emission peak decreased with an increasing degree of plough pan breakage. The cumulative N2O emission and intensity in PP5 was obviously lower than that in PP10 and PP15. Annual cumulative CO2 emission did not differ significantly among PP5, PP10 and PP15. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the rotation system increased as the thickness of plough pan decreased, so PP5 had relative higher NEP (9 740 kg C ha−1) than PP10 and PP15. Thus, considering better crop growth, higher yield, optimized N utilization, lower N2O and CO2 emissions, as well as higher NEP and less mechanical costs, breaking the original plough pan partially is a good choice to ameliorating the plough pan restrictions in the Northern China Plain.

TI  - ‘Best available techniques’ as a mandatory basic standard for more sustainable agricultural land use in Europe?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Substance emissions resulting from modern agriculture in the European Union (EU) affect the entire environment and are no less harmful than those caused by industrial installations. Even so, the EU requires only industrial installations, which include large intensive livestock holdings, to use the best available techniques (BAT). Agricultural land use, by contrast, needs simply to meet the standard of tried-and-tested technologies and generally accepted farming methods (good practice). This paper seeks to add a new perspective to existing political debates and scientific investigations by questioning the adequacy of existing regulatory requirements concerning agricultural land use and proposing that the BAT-Standard should be applied to agricultural land use, especially for high-input-farms. Were the BAT standard to be applied to agricultural land use, those techniques and farming methods which are most advanced and efficient in preventing environmental emissions, and so most effectively help to achieve a generally high level of protection of the environment as a whole, would have priority by law. The paper discusses which techniques and methods might meet these criteria by looking at four examples: conservation tillage, integrated pest protection, precision farming and organic farming.

TI  - How good is the evidence to support investment in soil protection
PY  - 2016
AB  - We review options for assembling evidence to support investment in protection from soil degradation by erosion, decline in organic matter, compaction and contamination. Convincing rationales for investment in soil resources need evidence about the benefits of improved soil status and the efficacy of possible actions. Changes in the bulk properties of soil over large areas are difficult to measure within the timescales of policy reviews, so soil monitoring rarely supports timely policy assessment. In addition, there are gaps in our understanding of the impacts of changes in soil properties at landscape scales. There is adequate quantitative evidence about the effects of land use change on soil erosion and soil organic matter (SOM) but rather less for compaction. Quantitative predictions of the effects at above field-scale on soil properties from altered land management within a given land use are quite limited, but can be described qualitatively. The effects of controls on soil contamination at regional scales are predictable from mass flows. There are accepted narratives about the benefits of reduced erosion and compaction, and enhanced SOM on levels of services and goods, including agricultural productivity and hydrology. However, quantitative models for estimating these benefits require more development. The impacts on greenhouse gas emissions of changes in soil organic carbon levels can be quantified and the impacts of contamination interpreted using threshold levels for protection of food and the environment. Overall, there is an urgent requirement for better quantitative models to predict soil-based policy outcomes from altered land use and especially land management.

TI  - Biodiesel co-product (BCP) decreases soil nitrogen (N) losses to groundwater.
PY  - 2014
AB  - This study compares a traditional agricultural approach to minimise N pollution of groundwater (incorporation of crop residues) with applications of small amounts of biodiesel co-product (BCP) to arable soils. Loss of N from soil to the aqueous phase was shown to be greatly reduced in the laboratory, mainly by decreasing concentrations of dissolved nitrate-N. Increases in soil microbial biomass occurred within 4 days of BCP application—indicating rapid adaptation of the soil microbial community. Increases in biomass-N suggest that microbes were partly mechanistic in the immobilisation of N in soil. Straw, meadow-grass and BCP were subsequently incorporated into experimental soil mesocosms of depth equal to plough layer (23 cm), and placed in an exposed netted tunnel to simulate field conditions. Leachate was collected after rainfall between the autumn of 2009 and spring of 2010. Treatment with BCP resulted in less total-N transferred from soil to water over the entire period, with 32.1, 18.9, 13.2 and 4.2 mg N kg−1 soil leached cumulatively from the control, grass, straw and BCP treatments, respectively. More than 99 % of nitrate leaching was prevented using BCP. Accordingly, soils provided with crop residues or BCP showed statistically significant increases in soil N and C compared to the control (no incorporation). Microbial biomass, indicated by soil ATP concentration, was also highest for soils given BCP (p < 0.05). These results indicate that field-scale incorporation of BCP may be an effective method to reduce nitrogen loss from agricultural soils, prevent nitrate pollution of groundwater and augment the soil microbial biomass.

TI  - No tillage increases soil organic carbon storage and decreases carbon dioxide emission in the crop residue-returned farming system.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission under different tillage methods in a crop residue-returned farming system may not be consistent with result from studies of the usual tillage researches because crop residues are important carbon sources with significant effects on soil carbon input and output. Herein, we address a knowledge gap over the “hot spot” research on tillage practices on SOC storage and CO2 emission in crop residue-returned farming systems. In this study, a long-term (2007–2019) field experiment was conducted, and the crop residues were returned to the soil after harvest; then, three tillage methods were conducted: no tillage (NT), subsoiling tillage (ST), and a moldboard plow tillage (CT). Our results showed that in the crop residue-returned farming system, NT and ST still showed advantages of lower CO2 flux compared with CT, as well as a reduced average CO2 flux of 14.5% and 8.5%, respectively, over a two-year average. The results of our long-term study suggest that the NT had advantages of SOC accumulation. In addition, as of June 2018, NT increased SOC stocks with 5.85 Mg hm−2 at a 0–60-cm soil depth compared with CT, whereas no significant difference was found between ST and CT. Overall, adopting NT in a crop residue-returned farming system improved SOC storage to 5.85 Mg hm−2 after 11 years as well as decreased CO2 flux by 14.5% in comparison with CT, which is meaningful in improving soil carbon pool and decreasing soil CO2 emission during agriculture production.

TI  - Preferential cooling of hot extremes from cropland albedo management
PY  - 2014
AB  - Changes in agricultural practices are considered a possible option to mitigate climate change. In particular, reducing or suppressing tillage (no-till) may have the potential to sequester carbon in soils, which could help slow global warming. On the other hand, such practices also have a direct effect on regional climate by altering the physical properties of the land surface. These biogeophysical effects, however, are still poorly known. Here we show that no-till management increases the surface albedo of croplands in summer and that the resulting cooling effect is amplified during hot extremes, thus attenuating peak temperatures reached during heat waves. Using a regional climate model accounting for the observed effects of no-till farming on surface albedo, as well as possible reductions in soil evaporation, we investigate the potential consequences of a full conversion to no-till agriculture in Europe. We find that the summer cooling from cropland albedo increase is strongly amplified during hot summer days, when surface albedo has more impact on the Earth’s radiative balance due to clear-sky conditions. The reduced evaporation associated with the crop residue cover tends to counteract the albedo-induced cooling, but during hot days the albedo effect is the dominating factor. For heatwave summer days the local cooling effect gained from no-till practice is of the order of 2 °C. The identified asymmetric impact of surface albedo change on summer temperature opens new avenues for climate-engineering measures targeting high-impact events rather than mean climate properties.

TI  - Effects of global change during the 21st century on the nitrogen cycle
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract. The global nitrogen (N) cycle at the beginning of the 21st century has been shown to be strongly influenced by the inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from human activities, including combustion-related NOx, industrial and agricultural N fixation, estimated to be 220 Tg N yr−1 in 2010, which is approximately equal to the sum of biological N fixation in unmanaged terrestrial and marine ecosystems. According to current projections, changes in climate and land use during the 21st century will increase both biological and anthropogenic fixation, bringing the total to approximately 600 Tg N yr−1 by around 2100. The fraction contributed directly by human activities is unlikely to increase substantially if increases in nitrogen use efficiency in agriculture are achieved and control measures on combustion-related emissions implemented. Some N-cycling processes emerge as particularly sensitive to climate change. One of the largest responses to climate in the processing of Nr is the emission to the atmosphere of NH3, which is estimated to increase from 65 Tg N yr−1 in 2008 to 93 Tg N yr−1 in 2100 assuming a change in global surface temperature of 5 °C in the absence of increased anthropogenic activity. With changes in emissions in response to increased demand for animal products the combined effect would be to increase NH3 emissions to 135 Tg N yr−1. Another major change is the effect of climate changes on aerosol composition and specifically the increased sublimation of NH4NO3 close to the ground to form HNO3 and NH3 in a warmer climate, which deposit more rapidly to terrestrial surfaces than aerosols. Inorganic aerosols over the polluted regions especially in Europe and North America were dominated by (NH4)2SO4 in the 1970s to 1980s, and large reductions in emissions of SO2 have removed most of the SO42− from the atmosphere in these regions. Inorganic aerosols from anthropogenic emissions are now dominated by NH4NO3, a volatile aerosol which contributes substantially to PM10 and human health effects globally as well as eutrophication and climate effects. The volatility of NH4NO3 and rapid dry deposition of the vapour phase dissociation products, HNO3 and NH3, is estimated to be reducing the transport distances, deposition footprints and inter-country exchange of Nr in these regions. There have been important policy initiatives on components of the global N cycle. These have been regional or country-based and have delivered substantial reductions of inputs of Nr to sensitive soils, waters and the atmosphere. To date there have been no attempts to develop a global strategy to regulate human inputs to the nitrogen cycle. However, considering the magnitude of global Nr use, potential future increases, and the very large leakage of Nr in many forms to soils, waters and the atmosphere, international action is required. Current legislation will not deliver the scale of reductions globally for recovery from the effects of Nr deposition on sensitive ecosystems, or a decline in N2O emissions to the global atmosphere. Such changes would require substantial improvements in nitrogen use efficiency across the global economy combined with optimization of transport and food consumption patterns. This would allow reductions in Nr use, inputs to the atmosphere and deposition to sensitive ecosystems. Such changes would offer substantial economic and environmental co-benefits which could help motivate the necessary actions.

TI  - Use of laboratory incubation techniques to estimate greenhouse gas footprints from conventional and no-tillage organic agroecosystems
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Organic agroecological systems “produce goods using methods that preserve the environment” but can be a substantial source of greenhouse gases (GHG) if not managed properly. The objective of this experiment was to monitor nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) transformations in soils resulting from N additions, water filled pore space (WFPS) and prior tillage management during a simulated freeze-thaw. Incubated soils were taken from two USDA certified organic five-year small grain rotations with mixed legume cover crops that varied only in tillage, conventional (CT) vs. no-tillage (NT) for 3 yr prior to sampling. Soils incubated for 149 d were left unamended or amended with 15N labelled urea or sugar beet residue and maintained at 40, 60 and 80% WFPS. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) verified that soils amended with beet vs urea clustered separately in ordination space. A two way PerMANOVA analysis confirmed a significant interaction between WFPS and N amendment (p = 0.0002). Prior tillage management, N treatment and WFPS had a significant effect on GHG emission from soils. At 40% WFPS, soil previously in NT amended with beet residues emitted more nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) relative to soil previously in CT. At 60% WFPS, soil previously in CT amended with beet residues emitted greater N2O and less CO2 relative to soil previously in NT. Our research indicates that climate, carbon stocks and duration of prior tillage management determined the potential of no-till to reduce GHG emissions during a simulated freeze-thaw. Growers should note that as much as 4.51% of nitrates (NO3−) in residues can be lost as N2O at an average soil temperature of 10 °C.

TI  - No-till systems to sequester soil carbon: potential and reality
PY  - 2020
AB  - The conversion of soils from conventional till (CT) to no-till (NT) management has been identified as a soil management practice with the potential to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and help mitigate global climate change. However, the changes in SOC observed in NT systems have often been variable and dependent on a combination of factors, including climate, cropping system, soil type and crop/soil management. This had led to large variation in the rates of sequestration observed worldwide. In addition, there is concern some studies may have overestimated SOC sequestration rates due to methodological issues, with some authors concluding that once these methodological factors are considered, the potential for NT to sequester C on a worldwide scale may be limited. When the effect of NT on N2O and CH4 emissions are also considered, the benefits of NT management to mitigate climate change can be further eroded and NT may even increase net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - for example from fine textured and poorly drained soils where NT management increases N2O emissions. However, the potential for net C sequestration in NT systems is site specific and where site conditions/management favor SOC accumulation and lead to neutral or decreases in N2O production, significant decreases in global warming potential (GWP) can be observed. This highlights the need to consider the net GWP of NT on a soil type, site or regional basis.

TI  - National-scale paddy-upland rotation in Northern China promotes sustainable development of cultivated land
PY  - 2016
AB  - As China requires more cultivated land to feed its increasing population, the sustainable development of cultivated land in its intensive agricultural production system has become a major issue for government and society. We firstly reviewed the progress of paddy-upland rotation (PUR) and conservation tillage, found that PUR was improve significantly soil properties, including redox potential of soil, the mineralization of soil organic matter, and the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, suggested that conservation tillage was an effective measurement for remedying the deficiency under the PUR. Meanwhile, we also systemically reviewed the statues of water resource infrastructure and policy level. Consequently, with current agriculture technology and the increasing capacity of adjusted artificial water resources, our results highlight the development of national-scale PUR as an effective adaptation strategy to protect and improve soil fertility and ensure agricultural security under climate change. In other words, from national strategy scale, national-scale PUR was a good choice in the major grain-producing areas of northern China in the coming 50–100 years. Lastly, further research in the few aspects was needed to better provide theoretical and technical support for promoting effectively the PUR.

TI  - Benefits and tradeoffs of reduced tillage and manure application methods in a Zea mays silage system
PY  - 2020
AB  - A critical question is whether there are agricultural management practices that can attain the multiple management goals of increasing yields, preventing nutrient losses, and suppressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. No-till and manure application methods, such as manure injection, can enhance nutrient retention, but both may also enhance emissions of nitrous oxide (N2 O), a powerful GHG. We assessed differences in soil N2 O and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions, nitrate and ammonium retention, and crop yield and protein content under combinations of vertical-till, no-till, manure injection, and manure broadcast without incorporation in a corn (Zea mays L.) silage system. During the growing seasons of 2015-2017, GHG emissions and soil mineral nitrogen (N) were measured every other week or more frequently after management events. Crop yield and protein content were measured annually at harvest. No-till reduced CO2 emissions but had no impact on N2 O emissions relative to vertical-till. Manure injection increased N2 O and CO2 emissions, with the magnitude of this effect being greatest for 1 mo post-application. Manure injection also increased soil ammonium and nitrate but did not increase yield or crop quality relative to broadcast application. Similarly, tillage did not affect crop yield or protein content. Despite the tradeoffs between mineral N retention and elevated GHG emissions, manure injection in no-till systems benefits farmers by reducing soil carbon losses as CO2 , retaining mineral N, and maintaining crop yields and quality.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Soil Cultivated with Vegetables in Crop Rotation under Integrated, Organic and Organic Conservation Management in a Mediterranean Environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - A combination of organic and conservation approaches have not been widely tested, neither considering agronomic implications nor the impacts on the environment. Focussing on the effect of agricultural practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil, the hypothesis of this research is that the organic conservation system (ORG+) may reduce emissions of N2O, CH4 and CO2 from soil, compared to an integrated farming system (INT) and an organic (ORG) system in a two-year irrigated vegetable crop rotation set up in 2014, in a Mediterranean environment. The crop rotation included: Savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda L. cv. Famosa), spring lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Justine), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. cv. Montebianco) and summer lettuce (L. sativa cv. Ballerina). Fluxes from soil of N2O, CH4 and CO2 were measured from October 2014 to July 2016 with the flow-through non-steady state chamber technique using a mobile instrument equipped with high precision analysers. Both cumulative and daily N2O emissions were mainly lower in ORG+ than in INT and ORG. All the cropping systems acted as a sink of CH4, with no significant differences among treatments. The ORG and ORG+ systems accounted for higher cumulative and daily CO2 emissions than INT, maybe due to the stimulating effect on soil respiration of organic material (fertilizers/plant biomass) supplied in ORG and ORG+. Overall, the integration of conservation and organic agriculture showed a tendency for higher CO2 emissions and lower N2O emissions than the other treatments, without any clear results on its potential for mitigating GHG emissions from soil.

TI  - Effects of global change during the 21st century on the nitrogen cycle
PY  - 2015
AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. The global nitrogen (N) cycle at the beginning of the 21st century has been shown to be strongly influenced by the inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from human activities, estimated to be 193 Tg N yr−1 in 2010 which is approximately equal to the sum of biological N fixation in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. According to current trajectories, changes in climate and land use during the 21st century will increase both biological and anthropogenic fixation, bringing the total to approximately 600 Tg N yr−1 by around 2100. The fraction contributed directly by human activities is unlikely to increase substantially if increases in nitrogen use efficiency in agriculture are achieved and control measures on combustion related emissions implemented.  Some N cycling processes emerge as particularly sensitive to climate change. One of the largest responses to climate in the processing of Nr is the emission to the atmosphere of NH3, which is estimated to increase from 65 Tg N yr−1 in 2008 to 93 Tg N yr−1 in 2100 assuming a change in surface temperature of 5 °C even in the absence of increased anthropogenic activity. With changes in emissions in response to increased demand for animal products the combined effect would be to increase NH3 emissions to 132 Tg N yr−1. Another major change is the effect of changes in aerosol composition combined with changes in temperature. Inorganic aerosols over the polluted regions especially in Europe and North America were dominated by (NH4)2SO4 in the 1970s to 1980s, and large reductions in emissions of SO2 have removed most of the SO42- from the atmosphere in these regions. Inorganic aerosols from anthropogenic emissions are now dominated by NH4NO3, a volatile aerosol which contributes substantially to PM10 and human health effects globally as well as eutrophication and climate effects. The volatility of NH4NO3 and rapid dry deposition of the vapour phase dissociation products, HNO3 and NH3, is estimated to be reducing the transport distances, deposition footprints and inter-country exchange of Nr in these regions.  There have been important policy initiatives on components of the global N cycle. For the most part they have been regional or country-based and have delivered substantial reductions of inputs of Nr to sensitive soils, waters and the atmosphere. However, considering the magnitude of global Nr use, potential future increases, and the very large leakage of Nr in many forms to soils, waters and the atmosphere, there is a very long way to go before evidence for recovery from the effects of Nr deposition on sensitive ecosystems, or a decline in N2O emissions to the global atmosphere are likely to be detected. Such changes would require substantial improvements in nitrogen use efficiency across the global economy combined with optimisation of transport and food consumption patterns. This would allow reductions in Nr use, inputs to the atmosphere and deposition to sensitive ecosystems. Such changes would offer substantial economic and environmental co-benefits which could help motivate the necessary actions.

TI  - Can conservation agriculture increase soil carbon sequestration? A modelling approach
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Conservation agriculture (CA) involves complex and interactive processes that ultimately determine soil carbon (C) storage, making it difficult to identify clear patterns. To solve these problems, we used the ARMOSA process-based crop model to simulate the contribution of different CA components (minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with crop residues and/or cover crops, and diversification of plant species) to soil organic carbon stock (SOC) sequestration at 0–30 cm soil depth and to compare it with SOC evolution under conventional agricultural practices. We simulated SOC changes in three sites located in Central Asia (Almalybak, Kazakhstan), Northern Europe (Jokioinen, Finland) and Southern Europe (Lombriasco, Italy), which have contrasting soils, organic carbon contents, climates, crops and management intensity. Simulations were carried out for the current climate conditions (1998–2017) and future climatic scenario (period 2020–2040, scenario Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 6.0). Five cropping systems were simulated: conventional systems under ploughing with monoculture and residues removed (Conv − R) or residues retained (Conv + R); no-tillage (NT); CA and CA with a cover crop, Italian ryegrass (CA + CC). In Conv − R, Conv + R and NT, the simulated monocultures were spring barley in Almalybak and Jokioinen, and maize in Lombriasco. In all sites, conventional systems led to SOC decline of 170–1000 kg ha−1 yr−1, whereas NT can slightly increase the SOC. CA and CA + CC have the potential for a C sequestration rate of 0.4% yr−1 or higher in Almalybak and Jokioinen, and thus, the objective of the “4 per 1000” initiative can be achieved. Cover crops (in CA + CC) have a potential for a C sequestration rate of 0.36–0.5% yr−1 in Southern Finland and in Southern Kazakhstan under the current climate conditions, and their role will grow in importance in the future. Even if in Lombriasco it was not possible to meet the “4 per 1000”, there was a SOC increase under CA and CA + CC. In conclusion, the simultaneous adoption of all the three CA principles becomes more and more relevant in order to accomplish soil C sequestration as an urgent action to combat climate change and to ensure food security.

TI  - Land radiative management as contributor to regional-scale climate adaptation and mitigation
PY  - 2018
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions urgently need to be reduced. Even with a step up in mitigation, the goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 °C remains challenging. Consequences of missing these goals are substantial, especially on regional scales. Because progress in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has been slow, climate engineering schemes are increasingly being discussed. But global schemes remain controversial and have important shortcomings. A reduction of global mean temperature through global-scale management of solar radiation could lead to strong regional disparities and affect rainfall patterns. On the other hand, active management of land radiative effects on a regional scale represents an alternative option of climate engineering that has been little discussed. Regional land radiative management could help to counteract warming, in particular hot extremes in densely populated and important agricultural regions. Regional land radiative management also raises some ethical issues, and its efficacy would be limited in time and space, depending on crop growing periods and constraints on agricultural management. But through its more regional focus and reliance on tested techniques, regional land radiative management avoids some of the main shortcomings associated with global radiation management. We argue that albedo-related climate benefits of land management should be considered more prominently when assessing regional-scale climate adaptation and mitigation as well as ecosystem services.

TI  - Soil carbon dioxide emissions in eggplants based on cover crop residue management
PY  - 2020
AB  - In this study, cover crop residue management as a strategy to identify agricultural practices suitable for increasing soil carbon (C) storage and contributing to the mitigation of CO2 in a cover crop–eggplant sequence was evaluated. The treatments applied were: (a) four winter managements [three cover crops (hairy vetch, oat and oilseed rape) and a bare soil]; and (b) three residue managements [residues incorporated into the soil at a depth of 0.3 m as deep tillage (DT), residues incorporated into the soil at a depth of 0.1 m as shallow tillage (ST), and residues left on soil surface (RS)]. Eggplant biomass and C content, soil CO2 flux, soil temperature and moisture were measured. Hairy vetch under DT showed the highest emission rate during the eggplant cultivation. At eggplant harvest time, CO2–C emissions were high in hairy vetch, intermediate in oat and oilseed rape, and low in bare soil (5.4, 4.2 and 3.3 Mg ha−1, respectively). Among residue managements, CO2–C emissions were higher in ST and DT than in RS (4.5 vs. 3.7 Mg ha−1, respectively). Despite contributing to the highest soil CO2 flux, the decomposition of hairy vetch residues supports the production of eggplant crop, as it is shown by the carbon input/output ratio, especially under RS conditions representing a temporary sink of CO2–C. As a system, hairy vetch RS is the most productively sustainable because it is simultaneously yielding the high eggplant crop biomass and retaining C residues in the soil.

TI  - Soil tillage and cover crop on soil CO2 emissions from sugarcane fields
PY  - 2019
AB  - Soil tillage is an agricultural practice that directly affects the global carbon cycle. Our study sought to assess the implications of adopting sunn hemp cover crops with different tillage practices on CO₂ emissions for two soil types (clayey and sandy soil) cultivated with sugarcane in Brazil. The experimental design was a split‐plot with randomized blocks, with the main plots being with cover crop or fallow and sub‐plots being under conventional or minimum tillage. Our results indicate that during the first 50 days after soil tillage, the variation in soil CO₂ emissions was stimulated by cover crop and soil tillage, while after that, it became dominated by the root respiration of sugarcane plants. We also found that over the first 97 days after the tillage, the clayey soil showed differences between minimum tillage with cover crop and fallow. Conversely, for sandy soil over the first 50 days following, there were differences between the tillage systems under cover cropping. Emissions from sugarcane rows were found to be greater than those from inter‐row positions. We concluded that soils under different textural classes had distinct patterns in terms of soil CO₂ emissions. The correct quantification of CO₂ emissions during the sugarcane renovation period should prioritize having a short assessment period (~50 days after soil tillage) as well as including measurements at row and inter‐row positions.

TI  - Mitigation of greenhouse gas emission from rice–wheat system of the Indo-Gangetic plains: Through tillage, irrigation and fertilizer management
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Rice–wheat cropping systems (RWCS) of the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) of India are tillage, water and energy intensive and an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Developing agronomic management in RWCS that lead to minimum adverse impact on soil, enhances water use efficiency, reduces GHG emission and are climate resilient is required. The aim of this study was to evaluate different combinations of GHG mitigation technologies for rice and wheat and to find suitable low carbon options for RWCS in the IGP. Seven management systems i.e. conventionally tilled wheat (CTW); zero tilled wheat (ZTW); transplanted puddled rice (TPR); dry direct seeded rice (DSR); intermittent wetting and drying (IWD); application of neem oil coated urea (NOCU); and surface application of rice residue (RR) were experimented in six combination of rotations [CTW-TPR, ZTW-TPR, ZTW-IWD, ZTW-DSR, ZTW + RR-DSR and (ZTW-TPR) + NOCU] for two consecutive years. Among these rotations, ZTW-DSR and ZTW + RR-DSR showed the lowest global warming potential (GWP) and GHG intensity in both the years. Adoption of these systems in the Indian-IGP can reduce GWP of the conventional RWCS (CTW-TPR) by 44–47% without any significant loss in the system yield. This was mainly due to significantly low CH4 emission (82.3–87.2%) in DSR as compared to TPR due to prolonged aerobic condition under DSR. However, frequent wetting and drying in DSR led to higher denitrification emissions of N2O (60–70%). Significantly higher emissions of N2O were observed in ZTW treatments (8–11%). NOCU was found effective in reducing N2O emission from ZTW (17.8–20.5%) leading to lower GWP as compared to CTW. Application of rice residue in ZTW treatment also reduced N2O emission (11–12.8%). There was no significant effect of different treatments in rice on GHG emission from the succeeding wheat crop; however, ZTW and ZTW + RR were found to enhance CH4 emission from the succeeding rice treatments.

TI  - Phenotyping for Problem Soils
PY  - 2015
AB  - Problem soils have serious physical and chemical constraints, impose stress on crops under cultivation and reduce its yield and productivity. Research efforts towards the development of tolerant cultivars for problem soils have gained all the advances from research areas of genomics but precision phenotyping still remains challenging. This chapter illustrates different phenotyping methods which have been used to screen genotypes against various problem soil conditions, discusses bottlenecks in the classical methods of phenotyping and exemplifies the application of high-throughput (HT) phenotyping in the current field of interest through red, green, blue (RGB) imaging, infrared thermography, chlorophyll fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging technologies. The HT phenotyping is a useful technique, and when it is empowered with other tools such as high-density linkage mapping and association mapping, it can accelerate the breeding process.

TI  - Tillage practices alter the surface energy balance – A review
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Tillage is commonly implemented worldwide to improve crop productivity by optimizing soil temperature and moisture, reducing penetration resistance of the seedbed, and suppressing weeds. However, these benefits are accompanied by drawbacks, including increased erosion and loss of soil organic matter. Research continues on how to maximize benefits and minimize drawbacks of tillage in a range of agricultural systems. The surface energy balance (SEB) may be a promising avenue for future tillage research because it describes the partitioning of energy into compartments crucial to crop productivity, especially heating the soil and evaporating water. Despite this relevance, very little research addresses the effects of tillage on the SEB, and the existing literature does not adequately describe the relationship between these two topics. The aims of this review are to identify research that has been completed on the subject, synthesize current knowledge, and propose topics for continuing research. This review suggests that alterations to soil surface cover, surface roughness, and near-surface porosity caused by tillage are reflected in changes in the SEB, with the greatest effects evident during wetting-drying cycles. The total available energy is increased following tillage, but the magnitude of change and partitioning of that energy is not understood, which directly relates to the energy available for heating the soil and evaporating water. Future research should focus on quantifying the magnitude of effects of tillage on the SEB, how those effects change over time, and identifying any other indirect effects that may inform better management decisions.

TI  - What does benchmarking of wheat farmers practicing conservation tillage in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains tell us about energy use efficiency? An application of slack-based data envelopment analysis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Escalating energy costs are an increasing concern for South Asian farmers growing rice and wheat in rotation. Millions of people in the IGP (Indo-Gangetic Plains) depend on this cropping system for food and income security. CT (conservation tillage) practices, including mechanical BP (bed planting), PTOS (power-tiller operated seeding), and ST (strip tillage), are advocated by donors and development organizations as profitable, high yielding, and energy-efficient alternatives to TT (traditional tillage). However, most studies on the EUE (energy input use efficiency) of CT originate from researcher-controlled and on-station experiments. Comparatively little information is available on the EUE of CT practices as farmers apply them in their own fields, and under their own management decisions. This research responds to this gap, and analyzes EUE of each of these three CT options, compared to TT, by surveying 328 rice-wheat farmers in north-western Bangladesh. Concentrating on wheat production, we employed a non-parametric benchmarking technique involving slack-based measures of technical efficiency, along with a fractional regression model to identify and compute the wasteful use of energy. PTOS achieved the highest EUE score (0.92), followed closely by BP and ST (both 0.91), whereas TT (0.68) was significantly (p<0.001) different and lower than the CT practices.

TI  - Improving carbon balance with climate-resilient management practices in tropical agro-ecosystems of Western India
PY  - 2017
AB  - ABSTRACT The present study was conducted in climatically vulnerable villages in Western India to evaluate the impact of climate resilient management practices such as improved agronomic practices, nutrient management, water management and residue management on carbon balance using the Ex-ante Appraisal of Carbon balance Tool (EX-ACT) developed by FAO. This model predicts the changes in the carbon emissions (source capacity) and sinks (sink capacity) using default emission coefficients for a time period of 20 years. The results revealed increase in sink capacity across the villages ranging from 16.4 (Chomakot) to 96.9% (Khuntil) in annual crops, and 4.8 (Bhalot) to 63.8% (Khuntil) in perennials. The fertilizer management increased the sink capacity varying from 3.1 (Chomakot) to 39% (Magharvada). However, the emissions ranged from 17 (Magharvada) to 93.2% (Bharu) in livestock and 6.8 (Bharu) to 83% (Magharvada) due to non-forest land-use change in majority of the villages. In irrigated rice, an increase in...

TI  - Wheat straw decomposition, N-mineralization and microbial biomass after 5 years of conservation tillage in Gleysol field
PY  - 2013
AB  - Long-term field experiment to follow various effects of conservation soil tillage is conducted at Biotechnical faculty in Ljubljana. The soil is Eutric Gleysol. Conventional treatment with plowing, 22 cm deep P, and conservation treatment by rotary harrow to a depth of 10 cm N, and subplots with compost amendment (-c) and without fertilization (-n) were observed. After 5 years nutrient contents and organic matter were higher in N than P. Compost addition had a positive effect on microbial biomass, but the tillage system did not affect it. However, nitrogen mineralization and decomposition of straw were higher in P as in N, and in the soil depth of 15 – 20 cm than in the 5 – 10 cm.

PY  - 2016
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of two legumes (Crotalaria juncea and Mucuna pruriens), as cover crops, and of natural fallow, as a control treatment, on the emissions of NOx, N2O, and CO2 from an Oxisol cultivated with corn, under conventional and no-tillage systems, in the Cerrado region, in Central Brazil. Variations of CO2 fluxes in the soil were explained mainly by soil humidity and, in the legumes, under conventional system, by soil NH4+-N concentration. Plots with legumes under no-tillage system had higher annual emissions of CO2, NOx, and N2O than natural fallow. Results show that the use of legumes as cover crops favors the emissions of NOx-N + N2O-N and CO2-C. However, when considering the potential for mitigation of CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions from the soil, it is important to evaluate changes in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks.

TI  - Beyond carbon sequestration: soil as conduit of solar energy
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary
The prospect, so alluring, of sequestering carbon (C) to mitigate CO2 build-up in air has prompted a flurry of soil studies, but questions still linger about whether early optimism was fully justified. My objectives are to review briefly the mechanisms of carbon accrual, consider constraints on soil C sequestration for mitigating climate, and contemplate questions for further collective conversation. Carbon in soil is ever in flux; not a stagnant reservoir, but a stream of atoms flowing through. Its instantaneous stock can be increased by adding more atoms to the stream or by slowing their rate of flow to CO2. The latter (decay) is influenced by intrinsic recalcitrance of the substrate, by protective interactions of carbon with the mineral matrix, and by the favourability of localized conditions for biological activity. Together, these mechanisms create a continuum of susceptibility to decay. Although many practices can abet carbon accrual, their effectiveness is constrained by the finitude of carbon gain, possible effects on other greenhouse gas emissions, susceptibility to future loss, the difficulty of measuring gains precisely, and the complexity of landscape-scale dynamics. In the light of these problems and prospects, I propose, as a working hypothesis, that we focus less on carbon, and more on using wisely the energy it carries; in other words, maximizing carbon ‘stocks’ is less critical than maintaining ‘flows’ to sustain the manifold functions performed by ecosystems. Among its implications, this hypothesis (i) enforces an ecosystem perspective, considering all inevitable trade-offs in the use of finite energy, (ii) emphasizes the importance of sustaining energy capture via photosynthesis, (iii) promotes a long view, evaluating carbon flows over several decades or longer and (iv) enfolds human aspirations, which ultimately shape carbon flows by demands on lands. Far from deflating the urgency of soil carbon research, this reoriented perspective may move soil carbon beyond a segregated stock to its central place as a dynamic hub in the energy cycles of our ecosystems.

TI  - Soil Management Practices to Mitigate Nitrous Oxide Emissions and Inform Emission Factors in Arid Irrigated Specialty Crop Systems
PY  - 2019
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from arid irrigated agricultural soil in California have been predicted to represent 8% of the state’s total GHG emissions. Although specialty crops compose the majority of the state’s crops in both economic value and land area, the portion of GHG emissions contributed by them is still highly uncertain. Current and emerging soil management practices affect the mitigation of those emissions. Herein, we review the scientific literature on the impact of soil management practices in California specialty crop systems on GHG nitrous oxide emissions. As such studies from most major specialty crop systems in California are limited, we focus on two annual and two perennial crops with the most data from the state: tomato, lettuce, wine grapes and almond. Nitrous oxide emission factors were developed and compared to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors, and state-wide emissions for these four crops were calculated for specific soil management practices. Dependent on crop systems and specific management practices, the emission factors developed in this study were either higher, lower or comparable to IPCC emission factors. Uncertainties caused by low gas sampling frequency in these studies were identified and discussed. These uncertainties can be remediated by robust and standardized estimates of nitrous oxide emissions from changes in soil management practices in California specialty crop systems. Promising practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and meet crop production goals, pertinent gaps in knowledge on this topic and limitations of this approach are discussed.

TI  - Impact of tillage on greenhouse gas emissions by an agricultural crop and dynamics of N2O fluxes: Insights from automated closed chamber measurements
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Our experiment aimed at studying the impact of long term tillage treatments – reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT), on CO 2 and N 2 O emissions by soil and at describing the dynamics of N 2 O fluxes. Gas measurements were performed from June to October 2015 in a Belgian maize crop, with homemade automated closed chambers, allowing continuous measurement at a high temporal resolution. After 7 years of treatment, CO 2 and N 2 O average emissions were significantly larger in the RT parcel than in the CT parcel. This observation was attributed to the effect of tillage on the distribution of crop residues within the soil profile, leading to higher soil organic C and total N contents and a greater microbial biomass in the upper layer in RT. A single N 2 O emission peak triggered by a sudden increase of water-filled pore space (WFPS) was observed in the beginning of the measuring campaign. The absence of large emission afterwards was most likely due to a decreasing availability of N as crop grew. N 2 O background fluxes showed to be significantly correlated to CO 2 fluxes but not to WFPS, while the influence of soil temperature remained unclear. Our results question the suitability of reduced tillage as a “climate-smart” practice and suggest that more experiments be conducted on conservation practices and their potent negative effect on environment.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in no-tillage systems: A meta-analysis
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract No-tillage (NT) has been touted as one of several climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices that improve food security and enhance agroecosystem resilience to climate change. However, the sustainable effectiveness of NT greatly depends on trade-offs between NT-induced changes in crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG, i.e. CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions. Such trade-offs are regulated by climate fluctuations and heterogeneous soil conditions and have not been well addressed. Supporting CSA management decisions requires advancing our understanding of how NT affects crop yield and GHG emissions in different agroecological regions. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted using 740 paired measurements from 90 peer-reviewed articles to assess the effects of NT on crop yield, GHG emissions, and the global warming potential (GWP) of major cereal cropping systems. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), NT reduced in GHG emissions and increased crop yield in dry, but not humid, climates, and reduced in the GWP at sites with acidic soils. Across different cropping systems, NT enhanced barley yield by 49%, particularly in dry climates, and it decreased the GWP of rice fields through a 22% reduction in both CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our synthesis suggests that NT is an effective CSA management practice because of its potential for climate change mitigation and crop yield improvement. However, the net effect of NT (relative to CT) was influenced by several environmental and agronomic factors (climatic conditions, tillage duration, soil texture, pH, crop species). Therefore, agroecological setting must be taken into consideration when conducting a comparative evaluation of different tillage practices.

TI  - Effects of tillage practices and straw returning methods on greenhouse gas emissions and net ecosystem economic budget in rice-wheat cropping systems in central China
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Significant efforts have been devoted to assess the effects of conservation tillage (no-tillage [NT] and straw returning) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global warming potential (GWP), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and net economic budget in crop growing seasons. However, only a few studies have evaluated the effects conservation tillage on the net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) in a rice–wheat cropping system. Therefore, a split-plot field experiment was performed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of tillage practices (i.e., conventional intensive tillage [CT] and NT) and straw returning methods (i.e., straw returning or removal of preceding crop) on the soil total organic carbon (TOC), GHG emissions, GWP, GHGI, and NEEB of sandy loam soil in a rice–wheat cropping system in central China. Conservation tillage did not affect rice and wheat grain yields. Compared with CT and straw removal, NT and straw returning significantly increased the TOC of 0–5 cm soil layer by 2.9% and 7.8%, respectively. However, the TOC of 0–20 cm soil layer was not affected by tillage practices and straw returning methods. NT did not also affect the N 2 O emissions during the rice and wheat seasons; NT significantly decreased the annual CH 4 emissions by 7.5% and the annual GWP by 7.8% compared with CT. Consequently, GHGI under NT was reduced by 8.1%. Similar to NT, straw returning did not affect N 2 O emissions during the rice and wheat seasons. Compared with straw removal, straw returning significantly increased annual CH 4 emissions by 35.0%, annual GWP by 32.0%, and annual GHGI by 31.1%. Straw returning did not also affect NEEB; by contrast, NT significantly increased NEEB by 15.6%. NT without straw returning resulted in the lowest GWP, the lowest GHGI, and the highest NEEB among all treatments. This finding suggested that NT without straw returning may be applied as a sustainable technology to increase economic and environmental benefits. Nevertheless, environmentally straw returning methods should be considered in future studies.

TI  - Benefits of sustainable management practices on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in soybean crop (Glycine max).
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Soybean in Iran is managed intensively and represents an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG). Developing an agronomic management that reduces GHG emissions while still ensuring optimum soybean yields is strongly required. Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in the Golestan province (North of Iran) to evaluate different combinations of GHG mitigation strategies for soybean cultivation. Treatments included: two tillage methods [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (ZT)], two residue management [wheat residue removed (R−) and wheat residue left on the system (R+)] and four levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization [0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha−1 (N1, N2, N3 and N4, respectively)]. Soil moisture and temperature, GHG fluxes, yield and agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AEN) were measured. The CT and R+ generally caused greater CO2 fluxes than the ZT and R−, respectively. The maximum CO2 flux occurred in August and this was about 362.6 and 284 mg m−2 h−1 under CT-R + -N4 and ZT-R + -N4. Soil CO2 emissions were higher in fertilized than non-fertilized treatments. Wheat residue left on the system under ZT reduced N2O emissions than CT, especially in N1. The cumulative N2O emissions were maximum under CT-R + -N4 and minimum under ZTR + -N1 (2.28 and 0.70 kg N2O-N ha−1, respectively). In this study, there was no significant effect on CH4 emissions. Soybean yield was similar among tillage systems and residue management, while N3 in combination with wheat residue showed the highest response of seed yield. CO2 emissions per unit of grain yield were the lowest under no-tillage associated with wheat residue mulch and nitrogen fertilizer. The results showed that GHG emissions could be mitigated in soybean crop in Iran. In particular, wheat residues left on the soil surface under no-tillage with 80 kg N ha−1 showed a reduction of GHG emissions, maintain crop yield providing environmentally-friendly option.

TI  - Topography Controls N2O Emissions Differently during Early and Late Corn Growing Season
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Topography affects soil hydrological, pedological, and biochemical processes and may influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions into the atmosphere. While N2O emissions from agricultural fields are mainly measured at plot scale and on flat topography, intrafield topographical and crop growth variability alter soil processes and might impact N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of topographical variations on crop growth period dependent soil N2O emissions at the field scale. A field experiment was conducted at two agricultural farms (Baggs farm; BF and Research North; RN) with undulating topography. Dominant slope positions (upper, middle, lower and toeslope) were identified based on elevation difference. Soil and gas samples were collected from four replicated locations within each slope position over the whole corn growing season (May–October 2019) to measure soil physio-chemical properties and N2O emissions. The N2O emissions at BF ranged from −0.27 ± 0.42 to 255 ± 105 g ha−1 d−1. Higher cumulative emissions were observed from the upper slope (1040 ± 487 g ha−1) during early growing season and from the toeslope (371 ± 157 g ha−1) during the late growing season with limited variations during the mid growing season. Similarly, at RN farm, (emissions ranged from −0.50 ± 0.83 to 70 ± 15 g ha−1 d−1), the upper slope had higher cumulative emissions during early (576 ± 132 g ha−1) and mid (271 ± 51 g ha−1) growing season, whereas no impact of slope positions was observed during late growing season. Topography controlled soil and environmental properties differently at different crop growth periods; thus, intrafield variability must be considered in estimating N2O emissions and emission factor calculation from agricultural fields. However, due to large spatial variations in N2O emissions, further explorations into site-specific analysis of individual soil properties and their impact on N2O emissions using multiyear data might help to understand and identify hotspots of N2O emissions.</jats:p>

TI  - Energy-efficient, sustainable crop production practices benefit smallholder farmers and the environment across three countries in the Eastern Gangetic Plains, South Asia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract In the Eastern Gangetic Plains of South Asia current agronomic practices are energy-intensive, and this contributes to higher cropping system production costs and CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly uncertain and scarce resources, together with an increasingly variable and changing climate, make conventional crop production vulnerable and unsustainable. We hypothesized that replacing traditional crop management with conservation agriculture based-sustainable intensification practices would reduce energy requirements and CO2-equivalent emissions while increasing energy use efficiency. Across three major cropping systems (rice-wheat, rice-maize and rice-lentil) we tested improved management practices against a conventional baseline on over 400 on-farm trials. Improved management practices significantly reduced the total energy used in rice-wheat cropping systems, from 30,045 MJ ha−1 under traditional baseline practice to around 26,500 MJ ha−1. Similar savings in total energy used were observed in rice-maize and rice-lentil cropping systems; additionally, energy use was significantly more efficient under improved management in all three cropping systems. CO2-equivalent emissions were reduced by around 10% under cropping systems with improved management compared to emissions from baseline systems. For all cropping systems the rice-equivalent yield and net income were inversely proportional to the specific energy of the system under improved management but not under traditional practice. This study demonstrated that high cropping system yields under improved management practices increased energy use efficiency while reducing CO2-equivalent emissions. Our research enables farmers in the Eastern Gangetic Plains to produce more food, more sustainably, under increasing climate variability and change. These results are applicable across the Eastern Gangetic Plains region of over 450 million people and also have broader application for smallholder cropping systems in developing and emerging-economy countries globally.

TI  - Agro-environmental aspects of conservation agriculture compared to conventional systems: A 3-year experience on 20 farms in the Po valley (Northern Italy)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract An evaluation of the effect of the conservation agriculture (CA) on agro-environmental aspects is needed at the farm scale in intensive production systems, which are likely prone to reduce soil fertility. Here, as part of the HelpSoil LIFE+ Project and involving 20 farms in the Po valley (Northern Italy), we have estimated the soil organic carbon (SOC) content, SOC stock, crop yield, biological fertility, soil biodiversity, and economic efficiency under different agricultural systems (CA and conventional, CvtA) at the beginning (March 2014) and end (October 2016) of the experimental period. CA was mostly represented by no-till practice (NT) coupled with the cultivation of winter cover crops. Minimum tillage (MT) was considered as CA or CvtA practice according to the farm design. The CA practices have been implemented on the monitored farms at different times (Long-term = before 2006, Medium-term = between 2006 and 2013, Short-term = after 2013). A direct comparison between CA and CvtA of soil-related variables, yields, and costs was performed on 14 out of the 20 farms; data were statistically treated with a linear mixed model. Overall, CA resulted in significantly higher SOC content, SOC stock, biological fertility, QBS-ar, and earthworms for the Medium-term group. Considering the effect of tillage practices observed on the 20 farms, SOC content was the highest in NT for the Long-term group. The biological fertility index was higher in NT and MT compared to CvtA within the Long-term and Medium-term groups in 2016. QBS-ar was the higher in MT and NT than CvtA for the Long-term and Medium-Term groups. The number of earthworms was the highest under NT for the Long-term group. Maize, winter wheat, and soybeans yields were generally 1 t ha−1 higher in CvtA than in CA, but this did not reach statistical significance. The cost for herbicides was 18% more expensive in NT, whereas the fuel consumption and total costs for weeding operations did not differ between NT and CvtA. The overall outcome of the analysis was that CA is a viable solution for intensive farms in the monitored area, but further skills need still to be acquired in to enhance its economic feasibility.

TI  - The Effect of Conservation Agriculture and Environmental Factors on CO2 Emissions in a Rainfed Crop Rotation
PY  - 2019
AB  - There are many factors involved in the release of CO2 emissions from the soil, such as the type of soil management, the soil organic matter, the soil temperature and moisture conditions, crop phenological stage, weather conditions, residue management, among others. This study aimed to analyse the influence of these factors and their interactions to determine the emissions by evaluating the environmental cost expressed as the kg of CO2 emitted per kg of production in each of the crops and seasons studied. For this purpose, a field trial was conducted on a farm in Seville (Spain). The study compared Conservation Agriculture, including its three principles (no-tillage, permanent soil cover, and crop rotations), with conventional tillage. Carbon dioxide emissions measured across the four seasons of the experiment showed an increase strongly influenced by rainfall during the vegetative period, in both soil management systems. The results of this study confirm that extreme events of precipitation away from the normal means, result in episodes of high CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. This is very important because one of the consequences for future scenarios of climate change is precisely the increase of extreme episodes of precipitation and periods extremely dry, depending on the area considered. The total of emission values of the different plots of the study show how the soils under the conventional system (tillage) have been emitting 67% more than soils under the conventional agriculture system during the 2010/11 campaign and 25% for the last campaign where the most appreciable differences are observed.

TI  - Crop production kept stable and sustainable with the decrease of nitrogen rate in North China Plain: An economic and environmental assessment over 8 years.
PY  - 2019
AB  - In pursuit of maximum grain yield farmers in the North China Plain usually apply excessive N fertilizer, resulting in wasted resources and environmental pollution. To assess the economic and environmental performances of different nitrogen rates will be conductive to sustain cleaner crop production. An 8-year field experiment was carried out with four treatments, N0 (0 kg ha−1 for winter wheat and summer maize), N1 (168 kg ha−1 for winter wheat and 129 kg ha−1 for summer maize), N2 (240 kg ha−1 for winter wheat and 185 kg ha−1 for summer maize) and N3 (300 kg ha−1 for winter wheat and summer maize), on the double cropping at Dawenkou research field (36°11’N, 117°06’E), Shandong Province, China. The crop production, soil physical-chemical parameters, and greenhouse gas emission are measured and the economic and environmental performances are assessed. The optimal nitrogen rate obtained the highest grain yield of summer maize in 4 of 8 year and was equivalent to conventional N rate in the other years. The nitrogen partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency of optimal nitrogen rate was 63% and 58% higher than that of conventional nitrogen rate. The optimal nitrogen rate effectively decreased soil bulk density and increased weight percentage of water-stable aggregate and activities of urease and invertase compared to conventional nitrogen rate, which improved soil productivity. The fertilizer nitrogen loss and global warming potential of optimal nitrogen rate reduced by 76% and 35% compared to conventional nitrogen rate. The annual greenhouse gas intensity of optimal nitrogen rate decreased by 14–35% compared to others. The net ecosystem economic budget under optimal nitrogen rate is 252–604 $ ha−1 yr.−1 higher than other addition levels. The optimal nitrogen rate produces more grains and obtains higher economic and environmental benefits.

TI  - Soil respiration characteristics in different land uses and response of soil organic carbon to biochar addition in high-latitude agricultural area
PY  - 2015
AB  - The farmland tillage practices changed the soil chemical properties, which also impacted the soil respiration (R s ) process and the soil carbon conservation. Originally, the farmland in northeast China had high soil carbon content, which was decreased in the recent decades due to the tillage practices. To better understand the R s dynamics in different land use types and its relationship with soil carbon loss, soil samples at two layers (0-15 and 15-30 cm) were analyzed for organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total carbon (TC), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), soil particle size distribution, as well as the R s rate. The R s rate of the paddy land was 0.22 (at 0-15 cm) and 3.01 (at 15-30 cm) times of the upland. The average concentrations of OC and clay content in cultivated areas were much lower than in non-cultivated areas. The partial least squares analysis suggested that the TC and TN were significantly related to the R s process in cultivated soils. The upland soil was further used to test soil CO2 emission response at different biochar addition levels during 70-days incubation. The measurement in the limited incubation period demonstrated that the addition of biochar improved the soil C content because it had high concentration of pyrogenic C, which was resistant to mineralization. The analysis showed that biochar addition can promote soil OC by mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. The biochar addition achieved the best performance for the soil carbon conservation in high-latitude agricultural area due to the originally high carbon content.

TI  - Application of a bias-corrected meta-frontier approach and an endogenous switching regression to analyze the technical efficiency of conservation tillage for wheat in South Asia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Conservation tillage (CT) options are among the most rapidly spreading land preparation and crop establishment techniques globally. In South Asia, CT has spread dramatically over the last decade, a result of strong policy support and increasing availability of appropriate machinery. Although many studies have analyzed the yield and profitability of CT systems, the technical efficiency impacts accrued by farmers utilizing CT have received considerably less attention. Employing a DEA framework, we isolated bias-corrected meta-frontier technical efficiencies and meta-technology ratios of three CT options adopted by wheat farmers in Bangladesh, including bed planting (BP), power tiller operated seeding (PTOS), and strip tillage (ST), compared to a control group of farmers practicing traditional tillage (TT). Endogenous switching regression was subsequently employed to overcome potential self-selection bias in the choice of CT, in order to robustly estimate efficiency factors. Among the tillage options studied, PTOS was the most technically efficient, with an average meta-technology ratio of 0.90, followed by BP (0.88), ST (0.83), and TT (0.67). The average predicted meta-frontier technical efficiency for the CT non-adopters under a counterfactual scenario (0.80) was significantly greater (P = 0.00) than current TE scores (0.65), indicating the potential for sizeable profitability increases with CT adoption. Conversely, the counterfactual TE of non-adopters was 23% greater than their DEA efficiency, also indicating efficiency gains from CT adoption. Our results provide backing for agricultural development programs in South Asia that aim to increase smallholder farmers’ income through the application of CT as a pathway towards poverty reduction.

TI  - Estimating cropland carbon fluxes: A process-based model evaluation at a Swiss crop-rotation site
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract In support of climate change mitigation strategies and food security, there is an ever-increasing requirement to understand the key drivers of cropland yields and carbon (C) budgets. Process-based crop models, driven by meteorological observations, can provide realistic simulations and diagnosis of the variability in crop C budgets. However, the field-scale observations required to validate the models, particularly across multiple growing seasons and crop types, are seldom available. This research evaluates the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Crop (SPA-Crop) model for estimating the C fluxes of multiple crop types and seasons at the Swiss long-term flux site Oensingen (CH-OE2). SPA-Crop is a detailed parametric model, simulating ecosystem photosynthesis and water balance at fine temporal (half-hourly time-steps) and vertical scales (multiple canopy and soil layers). We initialised the model at the point-scale using management information and meteorological observations recorded during ten crop seasons from 2004 to 2015. SPA-Crop has been developed for simulating winter cereals (wheat and barley), we further evaluated the model performance for these crops at CH-OE2 and extended the simulation to include a crop-specific calibration for winter rapeseed and pea crops. Model estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and gross primary production (GPP) were evaluated based on gap-filled and partitioned eddy covariance (EC) fluxes. Further comparisons were made between modelled and observed yields. The daily SPA-Crop estimates had a high agreement with the EC measurements across the different crop types with a mean R2 of the NEE of 0.74 (wheat), 0.73 (barley), 0.71 (rapeseed) and 0.69 (pea). The modelled yield estimates had biases ranging from −22% (barley, measured-model difference −70 gC m–2; 0.31 t ha−1) to +56% (rapeseed, measured-model difference −85 gC m–2; −0.38 t ha−1), with the largest bias of wheat being only −13% (measured-model difference 34 gC m–2; 0.15 t ha−1) across four wheat seasons. We recommend future SPA-Crop developments – particularly with regards to improving the precision of Reco estimates. Our research demonstrates that SPA-Crop is a reliable tool for simulating the C budget and yield across the four crop types: winter wheat, winter barley, winter rapeseed, and peas.

TI  - Greenhouse mitigation strategies for agronomic and grazing lands of the US Southern Great Plains
PY  - 2019
AB  - Challenges to sustainable agriculture are increasing with forecasts for greater climate variability, including rising temperatures, extreme precipitation events, and prolonged droughts. One important factor that contributes to the increasing climate variability is greenhouse gas emissions, including from agro-ecosystems. The US Environment Protection Agency indicates soil management and enteric fermentation from livestock contribute ~ 80% of total greenhouse gas from agriculture sector. Management practices conducive to greenhouse gas emissions, and possible mitigation strategies for the agricultural systems of Southern Great Plains, an integral part of the US beef industry, have not been thoroughly defined. The objective of this paper is to review and synthesize the literature regarding management practices conducive to emissions [carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4)] from croplands and grazing lands of Southern Great Plains, and potential strategies that may aid in greenhouse gas mitigation in the region. The results from different published studies evaluating such strategies were analyzed to determine whether these practices have potential in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agronomic and grazing lands. Based on the analysis, it can be recommended that increasing the amount of cropland managed by conservation tillage, fertilizer management, crop rotation systems, grazing management, and fertilizer amendments can be potential management strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation. As agro-ecosystems are very complex and reducing emissions using strategies in one sector may stimulate higher emissions in other sectors, these strategies require testing at the systems-level before they can be implemented to advise applied policies for the Southern Great Plains region.

TI  - N2O flux short-term response to temperature and topsoil disturbance in a fertilized crop: An eddy covariance campaign
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Using the eddy covariance technique, half-hourly N 2 O fluxes were measured over a sugar beet crop (ICOS Station, Lonzee, BE) from fertilization to harvest. Several parameters of the data quality control tests were adapted to suit the characteristics of N 2 O. No u* filtering threshold could be seen for N 2 O fluxes; therefore, it was determined based on CO 2 data. The uncertainty of N 2 O fluxes was assessed for several aspects of data treatment (total random uncertainty, spectral correction, u* filtering, gap-filling), which were combined to determine the uncertainty of the N 2 O budget. Between fertilization and harvest, the crop emitted 1.83 (± 0.21) kg N 2 O-N ha −1 corresponding to 1.2% of N supplies. Flux variability was characterized by three episodes of high emissions across the experiment, interspersed with lower background fluxes. These peak events were driven by soil moisture and temperature, dependent on the time-scale. Soil water content at 5 cm was identified as the single trigger for N 2 O emission peaks given sufficient N availability, while intraday oscillations were positively correlated to the variations in surface temperature rather than deeper soil temperatures. For the first time, an inhibiting and short-term effect of topsoil disturbance (seed-bed preparation) on N 2 O fluxes was recorded, which interrupted the peak that followed fertilization, and delayed the start of the next high emission episode. This observation, along with the synchronicity found between surface temperature and diel oscillations of N 2 O fluxes, supports the hypothesis of a N 2 O-producing microbial community located in the topmost soil layer. Given that a third of the overall N 2 O emissions during the measurement campaign occurred between fertilization and seed-bed preparation, further investigation into the timing of farming operations as mitigation strategies is needed. The contribution of N 2 O emissions to the net greenhouse gas balance (which comprises CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes) was estimated at between 20 and 66%. Our results stress the importance of including nitrous oxide when measuring gas exchanges in fertilized crops, and to do so at high temporal resolution for improved estimates.

TI  - Nitrous Oxide Production From Soils in the Future: Processes, Controls, and Responses to Climate Change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The increasing abundance of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere is a global concern. Although it is well known that soils are a major source of atmospheric N2O, elucidation of the complexity of the underlying microbial and chemical production processes and the roles of biotic and abiotic factors is still needed. Land management practices, especially nitrogen (N) fertilization in agroecosystems, are important determinants of soil N2O production and its consequent contribution to climate change. Here, we summarize the known N2O production pathways that contribute to soil N2O production and the factors that control these pathways, highlight the importance of land management practices in controlling soil N2O production, and discuss management strategies to reduce soil N2O emissions. We also address the roles of climate change itself and adopted strategies to mitigate climate change on soil N2O emissions. Although management practices have been identified to reduce soil N2O emissions, understanding of how these management practices act in combination and whether they lead to additive or multiplicative reductions in N2O remains limited. Examination of the underlying mechanisms of soil N cycling and N2O production and collection of empirical data across multiple management practices and soil landscapes under conditions that reflect a changing climate will facilitate model development and identification of effective N2O mitigation strategies.

TI  - LIFE+IPNOA mobile prototype for the monitoring of soil N2O emissions from arable crops: first-year results on durum wheat
PY  - 2015
AB  - Agricultural activities are co-responsible for the emission of the most important greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Development of methodologies to improve monitoring techniques for N 2 O are still needful. The LIFE+IPNOA project aims to improve the emissions monitoring of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils and to identify the agricultural practices that can limit N 2 O production. In order to achieve this objective, both a mobile and a stationary instrument were developed and validated. Several experimental field trials were set up in two different sites investigating the most representative crops of Tuscany (Central Italy), namely durum wheat, maize, sunflower, tomato and faba bean. The field trials were realized in order to test the effect on N 2 O emissions of key factors: tillage intensity, nitrogen fertiliser rate and irrigation. The field trial on durum wheat was set up in 2013 to test the effect of tillage intensity (minimum and conventional tillage) and nitrogen fertilisation rate (0, 110, 170 kg N ha -1 ) on soil N 2 O flux. Monitoring was carried out using the IPNOA mobile prototype. Preliminary results on N 2 O emissions for the durum wheat growing season showed that mean daily N 2 O fluxes ranged from –0.13 to 6.43 mg m -2 day -1 and cumulative N 2 O-N emissions over the period ranged from 827 to 2340 g N 2 O-N ha -1 . Tillage did not affect N 2 O flux while increasing nitrogen fertilisation rate resulted to significantly increase N2O emissions. The IPNOA mobile prototype performed well during this first year of monitoring, allowing to catch both very low fluxes and peaks on N 2 O emissions after nitrogen supply, showing a good suitability to the field conditions.

TI  - FICTA (1) - Effect of Soil and Climatic Attribute on Greenhouse Gas Emission from Agriculture Sector.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Agriculture sector is a major contributor to global greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission and thus to anthropogenic climate change. In the proposed system, we used soil attributes, i.e., soil type, soil humidity, soil temperature, Ph value, soil moisture, and climatic attributes, i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and location to analyze and predict the emission of greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 from Pune, India. We used different regression techniques and deep learning model to analyze and predict the emission of CO2 and CH4 for different crops and season wise also. The result indicated that the decision tree regressor gives good result, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values 0.032930 and 0.026116 for emission of CO2 and CH4 as compared to other algorithm used. The deep learning model works best for 4 layers of sequential neural network. The RMSE values for number of epoch 1000 with different layers are 13.18, 7.87, and 10.36. Thus the effect of soil and climate attributes makes the difference in the greenhouse gas emission from agriculture field.

TI  - Stream Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sediment Concentrations Show Contrasting Long-term Trends Associated with Agricultural Change.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Stream water quality can be greatly influenced by changes in agricultural practices, but studies of long-term dynamics are scarce. Here we describe trends over 21 yr (1994–2014) in nutrients and suspended sediments in three streams in a Midwestern US agricultural watershed. During this time, the watershed experienced substantial changes in agricultural practices, most importantly a pronounced shift from conventional to conservation tillage. In the 1990s and early 2000s, NH₄, soluble reactive P, and suspended sediment concentrations (standardized for discharge and season) each declined significantly (>4–12% per year) in at least two of the three streams (P < 0.01), whereas NO₃ changed relatively little. However, since the early 2000s, declines in NH₄ and sediment concentrations have slowed, soluble reactive P concentrations have not declined and may actually have increased, and NO₃ concentrations have declined sharply. The more recent lack of decline in soluble reactive P coincides with a plateau in the prevalence of conservation tillage and may be because of increased soil P stratification due to long-term reduced tillage. The more recent decline in NO₃ may be due to improved efficiency of N fertilizer use, increased soil denitrification, and/or declines in atmospheric N deposition. Our study shows that stream concentrations of N, P, and sediment can respond in contrasting ways to changes in agriculture, and that temporal trends can moderate, accelerate, or reverse over decadal timescales. Management strategies must consider contrasting temporal responses of water quality indicators and may need to be adaptively adjusted at scales of years to decades.

TI  - Influence of Tillage Systems, and Forms and Rates of Nitrogen Fertilizers on CO2 and N2O Fluxes from Winter Wheat Cultivation in Oklahoma
PY  - 2020
AB  - Cultivation of winter wheat under reduced tillage systems is increasing in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. Likewise, there is revived interest for including summer legumes in monocultures of winter wheat as green sources of nitrogen (N). This study investigated the influence of tillage systems (no- and conventional tillage), and source and rates of N fertilizer (0, 45 and 90 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in inorganic N fertilizer, and cowpea as green manure) on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from winter wheat cultivation. The study was conducted within a long-term field experiment initiated in 2011, at upland and bottomland sites near El Reno, Oklahoma during the 2016–2017 growing season of winter wheat. The experiment was conducted site-wise as split-plots in a completely randomized design, with N treatment as main plots and tillage system as subplots. Thus, there were a total of eight treatment combinations with three replicated plots (4 m × 10 m) in each combination in both sites. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured by a closed chamber connected to an infra-red gas analyzer, and fluxes were partitioned to gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Heterotrophic soil respiration (SR) was measured on bare soil spots. Fluxes of N2O were measured with an opaque closed chamber system with a portable gas analyzer. Dynamics of canopy CO2 fluxes (NEE, GPP and ER) were similar between tillage systems, while canopy CO2 fluxes increased with rate of N fertilization. Canopy CO2 fluxes from cowpea and an unfertilized control were similar, and the lowest, due to poor growth of winter wheat compared to the N fertilized treatments. Fluxes of N2O approximated zero from all treatments throughout the study and no response of N fertilizer or tillage system was seen. In conclusion, the results from this study indicated that canopy fluxes of CO2 from winter wheat are controlled by forms and rates of N fertilizers rather than tillage systems.

TI  - Organic farming and greenhouse gas emissions: A longitudinal U.S. state-level study
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Organic farming practices, focused on agro-ecological health, have long been centered on the idea that such approaches reduce resource intensity, improve soil health, reduce environmental burdens, and improve crop quality. These approaches can also mitigate climate change impacts. Our research examines the relationship between organic farming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using U.S. state-level data over the 1997–2010 period, we estimate that a one percent increase in organic farming acreage could reduce GHG emissions by 0.049%. We also find that the impact of organic farming on methane and nitrous oxide emissions varies with the share of transportation output. Put in context, at the current shares of transportation output, organic farming is expected to mitigate methane and nitrous oxide emissions across most states. The connection between transportation and organic farming suggests that the environmental harm of transportation output embodied in organic food production might be too negligible to outweigh the environmental benefits of organic farming. The current study provides evidence supporting potential GHG mitigation benefits associated with organic food production. Policymakers and scientists can build on these results to further develop the evidence base and policies needed to quantify and maximize the benefits of adopting organic farming practices.

TI  - Terrestrial ecosystem functioning affected by agricultural management systems: A review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract With increasing world population, there is an evident pressure on food production demand at the expense of environment. Maximizing yields at environmental cost is quite high especially in terms of soil and water deterioration. Traditional/conventional agricultural system is complemented with intensive tillage, mono-cropping and inappropriate crop residue management with deleterious impacts on the environment. Such agricultural practices have substantially contributed to climate change due to resulting greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. In recent decades, “conservation agriculture”, is being adopted which employs no or minimum tillage, diversified crop rotation and efficient crop residues management. Such approaches are associated to the decreased GHGs emissions due to low consumption of fossil fuels and fertilizers (especially N2O emissions from nitrogenous fertilizers). However, increased use of pesticides in conservation agriculture can be an important threat to the environment. This review collates impacts of both agricultural management systems on terrestrial ecosystem functioning in terms of soil quality and environmental sustainability. Impacts of conventional and conservation systems on soil health, carbon sequestration, GHGs emissions, cropping patterns, weed dynamics and environmental degradation are critically evaluated and research gaps are highlighted. Future research directions have been identified to promote the research regarding sustainable agriculture development.

TI  - Expansion of no-tillage practice in conservation agriculture in Brazil
PY  - NA
AB  - Abstract Brazil is one of the countries in which the practice of No-Tillage (NT) has been most widely implemented as one of the three fundamental ecological principles of Conservation Agriculture (CA), crucial for the sustainability of the national agriculture. The first official data on the use of this practice were collected in the Agricultural Census of 2006 and after that again in 2017. For the first time in the country’s history these surveys provided primary data that made possible an analysis of the dynamics of the adoption of NT practice within the development of CA systems. Data supplied by special tabulation showed that the expansion of the NT practice throughout the country was strongly associated with the expansion of soybean-based cropping systems involving crops such as maize, wheat or cotton. In other words, NT practice improved soil moisture conditions and generated additional growing period that permitted the incorporation of soybean crop into CA cropping systems where it was not possible before. The increase in the NT area was substantial in Mato Grosso state, but was also evident in the region called MATOPIBA (comprising the states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui and Bahia), i.e., the current agricultural frontier of the country, as well as in Rio Grande do Sul. In the regions where NT had already become the most common soil management system, e.g., in the South, this development occurred together with the area expansion of soybean-based cropping systems, showing that soybean is the most important crop in Brazil, in economic terms. However, the use of NT as a lone practice is no guarantee for sustainability, and technology transfer and adoption efforts are also required to reinforce the application by farmers of the other two ecological principles of CA which are permanent soil mulch cover and crop diversification through rotations and/or associations.

TI  - Tillage and crop residue management methods had minor effects on the stock and stabilization of topsoil carbon in a 30-year field experiment.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract We studied the effects of tillage and straw management on soil aggregation and soil carbon sequestration in a 30-year split-plot experiment on clay soil in southern Finland. The experimental plots were under conventional or reduced tillage with straw retained, removed or burnt. Wet sieving was done to study organic carbon and soil composition divided in four fractions: 1) large macroaggregates, 2) small macroaggregates, 3) microaggregates and 4) silt and clay. To further estimate the stability of carbon in the soil, coarse particulate organic matter, microaggregates and silt and clay were isolated from the macroaggregates. Total carbon stock in the topsoil (equivalent to 200 kg m − 2 ) was slightly lower under reduced tillage (5.0 kg m − 2 ) than under conventional tillage (5.2 kg m − 2 ). Reduced tillage changed the soil composition by increasing the percentage of macroaggregates and decreasing the percentage of microaggregates. There was no evidence of differences in the composition of the macroaggregates or carbon content in the macroaggregate-occluded fractions. However, due to the higher total amount of macroaggregates in the soil, more carbon was bound to the macroaggregate-occluded microaggregates in reduced tillage. Compared with plowed soil, the density of deep burrowing earthworms ( Lumbricus terrestris ) was considerably higher under reduced tillage and positively associated with the percentage of large macroaggregates. The total amount of microbial biomass carbon did not differ between the treatments. Straw management did not have discernible effects either on soil aggregation or soil carbon stock. We conclude that although reduced tillage can improve clay soil structure, generally the chances to increase topsoil carbon sequestration by reduced tillage or straw management practices appear limited in cereal monoculture systems of the boreal region. This may be related to the already high C content of soils, the precipitation level favoring decomposition and aggregate turnover in the winter with topsoil frost.

TI  - Effect of soil aggregate size and long-term contrasting tillage, stubble and nitrogen management regimes on CO2 fluxes from a Vertisol
PY  - 2019
AB  - Soil aggregates are the ‘building blocks’ of soil structure. Aggregation dominantly influences the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil. Farm management practices can alter soil aggregation, which can potentially influence carbon dioxide (CO) fluxes. We examined the effect of soil aggregate size on CO fluxes in a Vertisol following 47 years of contrasting management regimes, namely no-till (NT) or conventional till (CT), stubble retention (SR) or burning (SB), and without nitrogen (N) application (0 N) or with 90 kg N ha year (90 N). Aggregate size significantly affected CO fluxes over a 21-day incubation period, with the smallest aggregate size of <2 mm having the highest cumulative CO flux, followed by the 2–4 mm then 4–8 mm aggregates. The observed differences were mainly caused by total organic carbon contents, as well as substrate accessibility. Over all aggregate sizes, the SR treatments had higher CO fluxes compared to SB treatments due to additional substrate availability for microbial respiration. Cumulative CO flux was higher for the N fertilised treatments than the unfertilised treatments, likely as a result of increased soil organic matter content and the reduced C:N ratio. Fluxes of CO from small and intermediate aggregates were lower for NT compared to CT when 90 N fertiliser was applied, but not significantly different without N fertiliser application. This study identified the underlying controlling factors of CO flux from different aggregate sizes in a Vertisol under long term contrasting management regimes.

TI  - A critical review of the impacts of cover crops on nitrogen leaching, net greenhouse gas balance and crop productivity.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cover crops play an increasingly important role in improving soil quality, reducing agricultural inputs and improving environmental sustainability. The main objectives of this critical global review and systematic analysis were to assess cover crop practices in the context of their impacts on nitrogen leaching, net greenhouse gas balances (NGHGB) and crop productivity. Only studies that investigated the impacts of cover crops and measured one or a combination of nitrogen leaching, soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrous oxide (N2 O), grain yield and nitrogen in grain of primary crop, and had a control treatment were included in the analysis. Long-term studies were uncommon, with most data coming from studies lasting 2-3 years. The literature search resulted in 106 studies carried out at 372 sites and covering different countries, climatic zones and management. Our analysis demonstrates that cover crops significantly (p   0.05) effects on direct N2 O emissions. Cover crops could mitigate the NGHGB by 2.06 ± 2.10 Mg CO2 -eq ha-1  year-1 . One of the potential disadvantages of cover crops identified was the reduction in grain yield of the primary crop by ≈4%, compared to the control treatment. This drawback could be avoided by selecting mixed cover crops with a range of legumes and non-legumes, which increased the yield by ≈13%. These advantages of cover crops justify their widespread adoption. However, management practices in relation to cover crops will need to be adapted to specific soil, management and regional climatic conditions.

TI  - The effect of renovation of long-term temperate grassland on N2O emissions and N leaching from contrasting soils.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Renovation of long-term grassland is associated with a peak in soil organic N mineralisation which, coupled with diminished plant N uptake can lead to large gaseous and leaching N losses. This study reports on the effect of ploughing and subsequent N fertilisation on the N2O emissions and DON/NO3(-) leaching, and evaluates the impact of ploughing technique on the magnitude and profile of N losses. This study was carried out on isolated grassland lysimeters of three Irish soils representing contrasting drainage properties (well-drained Clonakilty, moderately-drained Elton and poorly-drained Rathangan). Lysimeters were manually ploughed simulating conventional (CT) and minimum tillage (MT) as two treatments. Renovation of grassland increased N2O flux to a maximum of 0.9kgN2O-Nha(-1) from poorly-drained soil over four days after treatment. Although there was no difference between CT and MT in the post-ploughing period, the treatment influenced subsequent N2O after fertiliser applications. Fertilisation remained the major driver of N losses therefore reducing fertilisation rate post-planting to account for N mineralised through grassland renovation could reduce the losses in medium to longer term. Leaching was a significant loss pathway, with the cumulative drainage volume and N leached highly influenced by soil type. Overall, the total N losses (N2O+N leached) were lowest from poorly and moderately draining soil and highest for the well draining soil, reflecting the dominance of leaching on total N losses and the paramount importance of soil properties.

TI  - Carbon and water footprints of major cereal crops production in China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and freshwater scarcity are central environmental concerns in China. They are closely linked to crop production. Based on a national-scale survey and statistics, we estimated the carbon footprint (CF) and water footprint (WF) of rice, wheat, and corn in China in 2011. The GHG emissions were 9.9, 3.9, and 3.7 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare (t CO2e ha−1) for rice, wheat, and corn, respectively. Carbon sequestration due to straw return mitigated 202–478 kg CO2e ha−1. Therefore, the farm CFs were 9.7, 3.5, and 3.4 t CO2e ha−1 for rice, wheat, and corn; while the product CFs were 1.4, 0.7, and 0.6 kg CO2e kg−1 respectively. The product WFs were 1.5, 1.1, and 1 m3 kg−1 for rice, wheat, and corn, respectively. Blue water made a greater contribution to WF in the north and northwest than to the other regions, and gray water occupied 27% of the total WF. Our results indicated that cereal production in China depended more on fertilization and irrigation than global average production requirements. The significantly positive relationships between the CF and WF indicated the possibility for simultaneous mitigation. Based on our results and other studies, we recommended potential practices, especially optimized fertilization and irrigation, and straw returns, to mitigate GHG emissions and water use to achieve environmentally sustainable agriculture in China.

TI  - Mitigation impact of minimum tillage on CO2 and N2O emissions from a Mediterranean maize cropped soil under low-water input management
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Reduced tillage might reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropped soils. However the topic is somehow still controversial, since lower CO2 emissions achieved through reduced soil mineralization might be offset by higher N2O losses from less disturbed soil, because of higher water filled pore space. This work aimed to clarify the potential GHG mitigation benefits of minimum tillage (MT), as opposed to mouldboard ploughing (CT), for Mediterranean maize cultivations under low water input management. To this end, soil CO2 and N2O fluxes were monitored at high time resolution by means of a newly developed automated system of closed static chambers coupled to a field gas photoacoustic detector. Relative to CT, cumulated CO2 emissions appeared significantly reduced in MT over three months after the autumn ploughing (by about 30%) and along the spring-summer cultivation (by about 28%), for similar maize yields. N2O emissions from MT showed restrained averaged values relative to CT (by 40% and 18% for fallow and maize periods, respectively); however differences might not be significant. For both treatments, N2O emission factors were lower than the 1% IPCC default value (0.40 and 0.28 for CT and MT, respectively), following the restrained irrigation water input along the drought period. Results indicate that MT reduced GHG emissions both (i) in the short-term, likely due to the increased decomposition of soil organic matter in the ploughed soil (CT), mainly concentrated within the first week after deep tillage; (ii) in the longer-term, likely through its capacity to constrain the daily soil temperature fluctuations in the drought periods along the spring-summer maize cultivation. At this stage, the low-water input management might have played a key role in mediating the response of N2O emissions to MT treatment. These findings suggest that minimum tillage could entail consistent GHG benefits under the drip irrigation management in Mediterranean croplands.

TI  - Field Phenotyping and Long-Term Platforms to Characterise How Crop Genotypes Interact with Soil Processes and the Environment
PY  - 2014
AB  - Unsustainable agronomic practices and environmental change necessitate a revolution in agricultural production to ensure food security. A new generation of crops that yield more with fewer inputs and are adapted to more variable environments is needed. However, major changes in breeding programmes may be required to achieve this goal. By using the genetic variation in crop yield in specific target environments that vary in soil type, soil management, nutrient inputs and environmental stresses, robust traits suited to specific conditions can be identified. It is here that long-term experimental platforms and field phenotyping have an important role to play. In this review, we will provide information about some of the field-based platforms available and the cutting edge phenotyping systems at our disposal. We will also identify gaps in our field phenotyping resources that should be filled. We will go on to review the challenges in producing crop ideotypes for the dominant management systems for which we need sustainable solutions, and we discuss the potential impact of three-way interactions between genetics, environment and management. Finally, we will discuss the role that modelling can play in allowing us to fast-track some of these processes to allow us to make rapid gains in agricultural sustainability.

TI  - Soil Carbon Sequestration: As a Climate Change Adaptation andMitigation Strategy - An Overview
PY  - 2016
AB  - Sequestration of atmospheric carbon is one of the mitigation measures for countering the anthropogenic climate change due to excessive emission of greenhouse gases. However, soil carbon sequestration measures need to be sustainable and significant, without substantial conflict between groups with diverse priorities. Carbon sequestration potential of soils in reduced clearing of primary ecosystems has attained substantial importance in modern agricultural farming systems apart from climate change adaptation. The adoption of diverse management strategies of carbon sequestration in croplands, grasslands etc., may provide potential estimation of carbon sequestration potential. Thus, the identification of any system for efficient land-based carbon sequestration therefore, requires a quantitative estimate on a regional setting. Research needs to be done to identify both horizontal and vertical agricultural technologies that restore carbon pools and soil quality and create tools to measure, monitor and verify soil-carbon pools and fluxes of greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen fertilizer sources and tillage practices on greenhouse gas emissions in paddy fields of central China
PY  - 2016
AB  - The effects of nitrogen (N) fertilizer sources and tillage practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission have been well elucidated separately. However, it is still remained unclear regarding the combined effects of N fertilization and tillage practices on the global warming potential (GWP) and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) in paddy fields. In this paper, a 2-year field experiment was performed to investigate the effects of N fertilizer sources (N0, no N; IF, 100% N from chemical fertilizer; SRIF, 50% N from slow-release fertilizer and 50% N from chemical fertilizer; OF, 100% N from organic fertilizer; OFIF, 50% N from organic fertilizer and 50% N from chemical fertilizer) and tillage practices (CT, conventional intensive tillage; NT, no-tillage) on the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), GWP, greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and NEEB in paddy fields of central China. Compared with N0 treatment, IF, SRIF, OF and OFIF treatments greatly enhanced the cumulative seasonal CH4 emissions (by 54.7%, 41.7%, 51.1% and 66.0%, respectively) and N2O emissions (by 164.5%, 93.4%, 130.2% and 251.3%, respectively). NT treatment significantly decreased the GWP and GHGI compared with CT treatment. On the other hand, NT treatment significantly decreased CH4 emissions by 8.5–13.7%, but did not affect N2O emissions relative to CT treatment. Application of N fertilizers significantly increased GWP and GHGI. It was worth noting that the combined treatment of OFIF and NT resulted in the second-highest GWP and GHGI and the largest NEEB among all treatments. Therefore, our results suggest that OFIF combined with NT is an eco-friendly strategy to optimize the economic and environmental benefits of paddy fields in central China. Although the treatment of SRIF plus NT showed the lowest GWP and GHGI and the highest grain yield among all treatments, it led to the lowest NEEB due to its highest fertilizer cost. These results indicate that the government should provide appropriate ecological compensation for this practice, which has low GHG emissions and high rice yield.

TI  - Inoculation with indigenous rhizobium strains increases yields of common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in northern Spain, although its efficiency is affected by the tillage system
PY  - 2015
AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) crops hold the potential to obtain higher yields by enhancing their biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) with Rhizobium. However in contrast to other legumes, common bean has shown a lack of positive response to inoculation with Rhizobium in many cases. This has led to a limited use of rhizobial inoculants in this crop, especially in Europe. The adaptation of bacterial strains to the rhizosphere is a key factor in the success of any inoculant, especially in a promiscuous legume such as common bean. This research aimed at increasing common bean yields via inoculation with effective indigenous Rhizobium leguminosarum strains. Three highly effective strains (LCS0306, LBM1123 and ZBM1008) which were selected according to their effectiveness at BNF in hydroponic conditions were separately inoculated onto common bean in a field experiment. The experiment was carried out under three environments and three tillage systems: conventional-tillage (CONVT), no-tillage (NT) and a cover-crop (CC). The grain yield observed with seed inoculation was significantly higher than the yield obtained with uninoculated seed under CONVT and CC. However, under NT inoculation had no effect. Furthermore, under CONVT and CC, inoculation with R. leguminosarum LCS0306 produced even higher yields than those obtained in nitrogen-fertilised or control plots. This is the first attempt to explain the inoculation performance of common bean under different tillage systems in Europe. A gene–based hypothesis has been used to explain the effectiveness of indigenous common bean rhizobia as nitrogen fixers in this crop.

TI  - Environmentally Sustainable Biogas? The Key Role of Manure Co-Digestion with Energy Crops
PY  - 2015
AB  - We analysed the environmental impacts of three biogas systems based on dairy manure, sorghum and maize. The geographical scope of the analysis is the Po valley, in Italy. The anaerobic digestion of manure guarantees high GHG (Green House Gases) savings thanks to the avoided emissions from the traditional storage and management of raw manure as organic fertiliser. GHG emissions for maize and sorghum-based systems, on the other hand, are similar to those of the Italian electricity mix. In crop-based systems, the plants with open-tank storage of digestate emit 50% more GHG than those with gas-tight tanks. In all the environmental impact categories analysed (acidification, particulate matter emissions, and eutrophication), energy crops based systems have much higher impacts than the Italian electricity mix. Maize-based systems cause higher impacts than sorghum, due to more intensive cultivation. Manure-based pathways have always lower impacts than the energy crops based pathways, however, all biogas systems cause much higher impacts than the current Italian electricity mix. We conclude that manure digestion is the most efficient way to reduce GHG emissions; although there are trade-offs with other local environmental impacts. Biogas production from crops; although not providing environmental benefits per se ; may be regarded as an option to facilitate the deployment of manure digestion.

TI  - Mapping and linking supply- and demand-side measures in climate-smart agriculture. A review
PY  - 2017
AB  - Climate change and food security are two of humanity’s greatest challenges and are highly interlinked. On the one hand, climate change puts pressure on food security. On the other hand, farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for climate-smart agriculture—agriculture that helps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture measures are diverse and include emission reductions, sink enhancements, and fossil fuel offsets for mitigation. Adaptation measures include technological advancements, adaptive farming practices, and financial management. Here, we review the potentials and trade-offs of climate-smart agricultural measures by producers and consumers. Our two main findings are as follows: (1) The benefits of measures are often site-dependent and differ according to agricultural practices (e.g., fertilizer use), environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sequestration potential), or the production and consumption of specific products (e.g., rice and meat). (2) Climate-smart agricultural measures on the supply side are likely to be insufficient or ineffective if not accompanied by changes in consumer behavior, as climate-smart agriculture will affect the supply of agricultural commodities and require changes on the demand side in response. Such linkages between demand and supply require simultaneous policy and market incentives. It, therefore, requires interdisciplinary cooperation to meet the twin challenge of climate change and food security. The link to consumer behavior is often neglected in research but regarded as an essential component of climate-smart agriculture. We argue for not solely focusing research and implementation on one-sided measures but designing good, site-specific combinations of both demand- and supply-side measures to use the potential of agriculture more effectively to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

TI  - Assessing the combined use of reduced tillage and cover crops for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from arable ecosystem
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Field management activities have significant impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropland soils. In this study, the effectiveness of combining reduced tillage with a mustard cover crop (RT–CC) to mitigate present and future GHG emissions from a fertilized spring barley field in the southeast of Ireland was assessed. The field site which had a free-draining sandy loam soil with low soil moisture holding capacity, had been managed for three years prior to measurements under two different tillage systems; conventional (CT) and RT–CC. Field measurements of soil CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions, crop biomass, water filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature and soil nitrate were made to capture both steady state conditions as well as the management events. Field data were used to validate the DNDC (DeNitrification–DeComposition) model and future GHG emissions under two sets of climate projections were predicted. Although fertilizer use was the same for both treatments the RT–CC treatment had significantly (p

TI  - No-tillage with rye cover crop can reduce net global warming potential and yield-scaled global warming potential in the long-term organic soybean field
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract No-tillage (NT) and the introduction of cover crops, owing to their positive effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and crop yields, are potential agricultural practices that both support food security under the new realities of climate change and alleviate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the effects of the combination of long-term NT systems and cover crops on non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and SOC sequestration have not been adequately documented, particularly in East Asia. We conducted a split-plot field experiment involving two tillage systems [NT and moldboard plowing (MP)] and three cover crops, namely, fallow (FA), hairy vetch (HV), and rye (RY). NT had slightly higher soybean yield than MP, although tillage methods and cover crop treatments had no significant effects on soybean yield. Cover crop treatments rather than tillage methods significantly affected methane (CH4) emissions; under FA and RY treatments, we observed CH4 uptakes, whereas under HV, we observed CH4 emissions. In contrast, rather than cover crop treatments, tillage methods affected nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Higher WFPS and soil bulk density under NT resulted in significantly higher annual N2O emissions than those under MP. However, under NT, the annual SOC sequestration rate significantly increased compared with that under MP, the global warming potential (GWP) caused by CH4 and N2O emissions was fully offset by net CO2 retention under NT. Additionally, treatment under NT reduced net GWP and yield-scaled GWP to a significantly greater degree than did treatment under MP. Treatments under NT with RY cover crop had the lowest net GWP (−2324 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1) and yield-scaled GWP (−1037 kg CO2 equivalent Mg−1 soybean yield). These findings suggest that treatments under NT with cover crop systems—especially RY cover crop—in the long-term organic soybean field maintains sustainable crop production and reduces net GWP and yield-scaled GWP, which will be an effective climate-smart agriculture practice in the humid, subtropical regions prevailing in Kanto, Japan.
