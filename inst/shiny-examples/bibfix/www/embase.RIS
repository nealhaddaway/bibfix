AB  - Workers in a noisy department of a metal fabrication plant took hearing tests before and at the end of their workshifts to ascertain the extent of temporary hearing losses that occurred with and without earplugs being worn. This information was fed back to individual workers as a means for motivating greater use of ear protectors issued for hearing conservation purposes. Subsequent observations of earplug users in this department for 5 months showed a steady increase, attaining a level of 85-90%. No more than 10% of the workers in another noisy department in the same plant, serving as a control group, wore earplugs over the same 5-month period after being given a standard lecture on hearing conservation in noise, later augmented by disciplinary threats. The effectiveness of the feedback technique in promoting earplug usage was explained as a two-stage process involving individual reinforcement, and subsequent group adoption of new norms for accepted behavior.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of a tinnitus awareness survey on the hearing conservation behaviors of freshman music majors (as measured 30 weeks later with a follow-up survey). The surveys were distributed to students at a large school of music in a public university (n = 200) and a small music department in a private university (n = 48). More than half the students (58.9%) claimed to have tinnitus at some level. The most frequent response to what caused their tinnitus was "not sure," followed by "exposure to noise over an extended period of time." Most students (64.2% to 95%) did not wear hearing protection during rehearsals, concerts, or loud non-performance-related activities. In the follow-up survey, the majority (86.0%) said they did not change their use of hearing protection devices (including those students with tinnitus), but the students in the small college claimed to use significantly more protection than the students in the large college. Since the students in the small college received additional specific examples of tinnitus problems when completing the preliminary survey, it was concluded that more examples might be necessary to raise the awareness of factors leading to tinnitus. The result could be a positive change in the students' use of hearing protection.

AB  - The major aim of the Workers' Hearing Protection Program, undertaken by the Provincial Center of Occupational Medicine in Kielce, is to protect worker's hearing against adverse effects of occupational noise. The level of workers' awareness and knowledge of noise exposure was assessed during the initial state diagnosis. The anonymous survey covered 945 workers from 19 plants in the Swietokrzyskie province. In this group, 31% of workers was exposed to 75-85 dB(A) and 69% of workers to over 85 dB(A); 88% of those under study were aware of the exposure to the occupational exposure level (OEL) and 69% of them regarded their work as arduous and harmful. The workers reported that noise affected mostly their hearing organ (77%) and nervous system 61%). Of the 69%, only 39% of the workers exposed to noise exceeding 85 dB(A) were aware of that fact. The workers reported that the most frequent sources of information on noise levels in their workplaces were: heads of departments (44%), employees of work safety and hygiene section (44%), and physicians (23%). The results of the study indicate that occupational health services at workplaces should not limit their activities to therapy, but they should also carry out health education and perceive it as a basis for efficient protection of health and promotion of health conducive behavior.

AB  - The continuous high-intensity noise in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is both stressful and harmful for the premature infant. Although some researchers have found evidence that loud noise can cause hearing loss and alter physiologic and behavioral responses, no study to date has investigated the benefits of noise reduction by the use of earmuffs. In this study earmuffs were placed over the premature infants' ears to reduce noise intensity in the NICU while physiologic and behavioral responses were measured. Two sites were used to collect data: in the first setting, 17 low birth weight infants were randomly assigned to an experimental and a control group, whereas 13 infants from a second hospital acted as their own controls and were tested with and without earmuffs. Earmuffs that reduced the intensity of noise by 7 to 12 dB were worn by infants in the experimental group only during the observation periods. Infants in the control group were exposed to the usual noise in the NICU. The infant's physiologic and behavioral responses were observed for four 2-hour intervals, morning and evening, on two consecutive days. Most of the significant results were from the site at which infants acted as their own controls. When infants wore the earmuffs, they had significantly higher mean oxygen saturation levels and less fluctuation in oxygen saturation. Furthermore, these infants had less frequent behavioral state changes, spent more time in the quiet sleep state, and had longer bouts in the sleep state. It is imperative that NICUs develop aggressive antinoise policies to substantially and consistently reduce noise.

AB  - Background: Acoustic trauma caused by firearms has been well known for years. Surprisingly, how to prevent this harmful event is unfamiliar to the policemen. Method(s): Twenty policemen were subjected to conventional and ultrahigh frequency audiometries, before and after shooting with submachine gun and rifle. Result(s): In conventional audiometry, 6 kHz and 8 kHz were the frequencies that most often influenced by gunfire. In the ultrahigh frequency audiometry, more than 50% of the ears had abnormal hearing in every frequency. Conclusion(s): It is recommended that the policemen should use ear plugs as well as ear muffs during shooting.

AB  - Objectives - The aim of the study was a retrospective assessment of the exposure of professional soldiers to impulse noise from gunfire. Methods - A questionnaire on noise exposure and use of hearing protectors was administered to a stratified random sample of 699 army officers (mean age 39.8 years) with an average of 18 years of exposure to shooting noise. For a comparison of the number of shots from different weapons, the peak sound pressure levels of shots were adjusted in relation to one pistol shot according to the equal energy principle. Total exposure time was estimated with the equal energy principle, the number of shots from different weapons, the energy levels of different shots, the effectiveness of hearing protection, and the distance from the noise source being taken into account. Results - Rifles, shotguns, and pistols were the predominant exposure sources. Impulse noise exposure averaged 164 183 shots from different weapons. After adjustment to the energy level of one pistol shot, the average was 78 000 personally fired shots. The total shooting noise exposure averaged 218 000 adjusted shots. Translated into exposure to steady noise of 85 dB(A) for 40 h a week, the exposure to noise from personally fired shots equaled an exposure time of 22.0 years and the total exposure averaged 61.0 years. The heaviest exposure occurred during the first 10-15 years of the men's careers. Conclusions - Exposure to gunfire noise among professional soldiers is high enough to cause severe hearing deterioration already at early career stages if effective hearing protectors are not worn at all times on shooting occasions.

AB  - In spite of strict safety regulations concerning firearm shooting, several hundred conscripts still suffer acute acoustical trauma (AAT) in the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) every year, resulting in symptoms such as tinnitus and/or hearing impairment. The causes leading to AAT, causative weapons and mode and level of hearing protection were analysed to find out why so many AATs still occur in the FDF. The material consisted of 119 patients of the total 163 AAT patients treated at the Central Military Hospital during the year 2000. In 87. 5% of cases, the AATs occurred in unprotected ears. The most common causative weapon was the assault rifle. Most of the AATs occurred during combat training in the field. Immediately after the AAT, 46.7% of conscripts had hearing impairment and 94.2% tinnitus. Hearing loss, tinnitus or both were experienced by 45% of conscripts at the last follow-up. Careful planning of training exercises could probably prevent some but not all AATs.

AB  - Young men conscripted into the armed forces still run a risk of suffering hearing damage during their military service. This risk could be reduced by effective personal hearing protectors. The standard tests to determine the attenuation values of hearing protectors cannot be applied to high-intensity impulse noise from firearms, but the protectors should be evaluated under actual firing conditions. The attenuation values of the hearing protectors (earmuffs) most commonly used in the Finnish Army were tested for impulse noise from different weapons. The attenuation was found to be good for pistol shots, moderate for rifle shots and very poor for cannonfire. The tested earmuffs gave only minimal protection against low-frequency impulse energy.

AB  - Etiological factors and otological and audiological findings were analysed retrospectively in 361 Finnish conscripts who had suffered acute trauma (AAT) from firearms shooting during their military service. The most common cause of AAT was shooting with hand-held weapons without ear-protectors (50%). Other common causal weapons were antitank guns (25%) and cannons (12%). Explosions had caused AAT in one-tenth of the cases. The tympanic membrane had been ruptured in 22 subjects (6%). The frequency at which hearing loss was severest was most commonly 6.0 kHz, followed by 8.0 kHz and 4.0 kHz in that order. Speech frequencies were involved in about 25% of the ears. A flat type of audiometric configuration was observed in about 20% and a rising type (low-tone loss) in about 5% of the ears. Impulse noise from large-calibre guns seemed to cause low-tone hearing loss more often than shooting with hand-held weapons.

AB  - Most of the textile industries in developing countries like Tanzania are facing a big problem of noise pollution. In most of these countries, the industrial hearing conservation programme is not yet established. The assessment of noise pollution in textile industries has been the aim of this study and Friendship Textile Mill (FTM) is chosen as the case study. The investigation was concerned with the noise exposure and its adverse effects to workers at the mill. The findings revealed that about 30% of the FTM employees are working in hazardous environments of above 90 dB, which is the recommended safe limit of noise in the working environment for 8 h used in Tanzania. In this regard, a programme which includes different methods of how to control the problem, has been proposed for conserving hearing at the factory. The methods include the use of hearing protective devices, modification of the noise source, repair of machines, and preemployment and periodic audiometric testing.

AB  - In the light of EEC proposals on the avoidance of damage to hearing caused by noise, a study was undertaken to determine the risk posed by powered orthopaedic instruments. The noise levels from a number of air-powered and electric tools were measured and analysed and found to exceed the recommended levels. The predicted daily personal noise exposure was calculated and the potential for hearing damage confirmed. Twenty-seven senior orthopaedic staff were then assessed by audiometry; evidence of noise-induced hearing loss was found in half the subjects. The increasing use of powered instruments in elective orthopaedics and fracture fixation may present a significant cumulative risk to the hearing of orthopaedic surgeons and theatre personnel. The use of ear defenders should be promoted, and manufacturers should be encouraged to develop instruments with lower noise emission levels.

AB  - This review examines the evidence for a possible relationship between accidents and noise in industry. It has often been asserted that noise can be the cause of accidents; however, only five studies have attempted to assess the extent of this problem. These studies have indicated that high noise levels may be associated with higher accident rates and therefore provide suggestive but not conclusive evidence that noise is a contributory factor in the causation of accidents. The possible mechanisms of such an effect include the role of noise in causing a lack of attention and the masking of important auditory signals such as warning shouts, sirens and machinery sounds which indicate impending danger. In addition, the effects of a noise-induced hearing loss and the need to wear personal hearing protection to counter the noise could contribute indirectly to accidents by interfering with auditory communications. It is concluded that the possible link between noise and industrial accidents further emphasizes the need for reducing noise in industry and that this should be achieved wherever possible by means of noise control.

The speech-recognition scores of 12 normal and 12 hearing-impaired subjects were measured for a wide range of conditions designed to be representative of those in the workplace. Conditions included testing in quiet, in two types of background noise (white versus speech spectrum), at three signal-to-noise ratios (+5, 0, -5 dB), and in three conditions of protection (unprotected, earplugs, earmuffs). The mean results for all 21 listening conditions and both groups of subjects were accurately described by the AI. Moreover, a single transfer-function relating performance to the AI could describe all the data from both groups.

AB  - Twenty nine female and 97 male workers from three factories were screened for high frequency hearing loss and questioned regarding their knowledge and use of hearing protection. Similar proportions of men and women had noise induced hearing loss. Compared with men, women with noise induced hearing loss were more surprised to learn of their deafness and reported less knowledge and use of hearing protection. These results suggest that the incidence of noise induced hearing loss among women has been underestimated and that women workers' education regarding noise-induced hearing loss is neglected.

AB  - The obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (or alveolar hypoventilation in the obese) is a new name for an old syndrome, P.ickwickian syndrome. It is defined as chronic alveolar hypoventilation (PaO2 < 70 mmHg, PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) in obese patient with a body mass index > 30 kg/m2 who have no other respiratory disease explaining the gas anomalies. The large majority of obese subjects are not hypercapnic, even in case of severe obesity. There are three principal causes explaining alveolar hypoventilation in obese subjects: high cost of the work of respiration, dysfunction of the respiratory centers, repeated episodes of nocturnal obstructive apnea. The obesity-hypoventilation syndrome is generally found in males aged over 50 years. Exercise-induced breathlessness is a constant finding. Diagnosis is often made after an episode of severe respiratory failure. Associated diseases favored by obesity are frequent: diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease. By definition, there is a hypoxemia-hypercapnia syndrome persisting after an acute episode. Spirography usually demonstrates moderate volume restriction. Pulmonary hypertension is frequent but not constant. Obesity-hypoventilation syndrome must be distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea, although the two conditions are often associated. Obstructive sleep apnea may be absent in certain patients with obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (we have had several cases) and inversely, obesity is not observed in certain patients with obstructive apnea. It should be recalled that the term Pickwickian syndrome designates obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (with or without obstructive apnea) and not obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

AB  - Noise levels were measured in several different environments and conditions in which high-risk neonates are exposed. These environments included: (1) an intensive care nursery, (2) an infant life support module in an intensive care nursery, (3) an infant life support module in three different aircraft, and (4) an infant life support module in a transport van. Based on the results of this investigation, the following statements are warranted: (1) Noise levels inside the closed ILSM-P in all three aircraft and in the transport van exceeded levels that have heretofore been shown to produce physiologic changes in infants. (2) Ear protectors for high-risk neonates should be considered as a possible method for reducing noise exposure in noisy environments. (3) Noise level measurements should be made with an external linear octave filter scale in order to determine which frequency bands contain the greatest intensity. Results of this study indicate that the frequency bands below 1,000 Hz should be attenuated most. (4) Additional research should be conducted to ascertain the noise and frequency levels at which psychologic, physiologic, and pathologic changes occur in high-risk neonates.

AB  - Aim: Professional orchestral musicians are exposed to sound levels which can potentially lead to hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to examine if personally adapted earplugs with integrated filters which uniformly reduce the sound level over a wide frequency range (ER-15) might help to avoid temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and thus probably permanent threshold shifts (PTS). Secondly, we investigated whether these earplugs are acceptable to the musicians. Method and Collective: 40 of the 127 members of the 'Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg' participated in this study. 6 of the musicians, all brass and woodwind players, ended their participation because of difficulties in playing when wearing ER-15 earplugs. Pure-tone audiometry was carried out to determine air conduction (0.25-8 kHz) 11 minutes (mean) after playing with and without earplugs during opera performances (i.e. two audiometric tests per member). Furthermore we drew up audiograms for air and bone conduction before the first performances, and the participants filled in a questionnaire about the suitability of the earplugs. During the opera performances equivalent continuous sound levels (Leq dB(A)) were measured at each musician's place. Result(s): On average the hearing levels for bone conduction did not exceed the normal loss of hearing with age. Equivalent sound level values from 83.0 to 94.1 dB(A) were found depending on the opera and instrument. Peak sound levels reached 97 to 112 dB(A). The equivalent sound levels of brass and woodwind players were 4 dB(A) higher than those of the strings. Most of the musicians declared they had considerable difficulties in playing their instruments and playing with the orchestra. After playing without earplugs more distinct differences in the hearing threshold were found than after a performance with earplugs. The difference in the hearing levels exceeded 3 dB at 4 kHz on the right and 4 to 6 kHz on the left (p each < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The results of the audiometric tests prove the effectiveness of the earplugs. Nevertheless, the questionnaires revealed that they cause considerable limitations for the musicians' professional work, especially for brass and woodwind players. Earplugs therefore cannot be recommended in general during performances, but should be made available on demand for orchestral musicians.

AB  - Six subjects listened to broadcast popular music programmes on each of six earmuff-like personal radio headsets while seated in a diffuse, pink noise sound field which could be set to 80, 85, 90 or 95dBA., In each condition, in-ear sound pressure levels were measured with a miniature microphone located in the subject's concha. SPLs were also measured with the ears uncovered in the 80dBA field in order to provide a basis for determining the noise reduction of each device. It was found that, despite their earmuff-like appearance, five of the six devices provided no significant protection from external noise. For all devices, listening to the built-in radio further increased the subject's total noise exposure. In higher ambient noise levels, subjects' adjustments of radio signal loudness indicated they were prepared to tolerate poorer signal/noise ratios, presumably in order to limit their total noise exposure. However, the degree of this apparently self-protective behaviour may be over-estimated by the present experiment, which employed laboratory subjects generally familiar with the hazards of noise. In the absence of evidence indicating that a device of this kind significantly attenuates ambient noise, it would be wise not to use it in ambient levels where the equivalent continous exposure exceeds about 80dBA (LAeq8h).

AB  - Introduction: Double hearing protection is used in many air forces around the world for protection in noisy aircraft environments, particularly in helicopters. The usual combination is foam ear plugs under headset or helmet muffs. Much of the research that spurred the introduction of foam earplugs indicated little change in speech intelligibility in persons with normal hearing. However, aircrew often complain about having to maximize intercom volume for speech understanding, causing a situation with no reserve volume and bad sound quality. In recent years, further developments have included so-called hi-fi plugs and custom made ear plugs which are claimed to improve speech communication. The aim of the present project was to investigate different types of ear plugs and their effect on speech intelligibility in helicopter noise. Method(s): Each of nine normal-hearing pilot subjects were placed in an environment of recorded helicopter noise from a BO-105 helicopter. Speech audiometry was performed under four different conditions: headset only, and three different ear plugs worn under the headset. Fitting of the ear plugs was performed by an ear, nose and throat specialist to ensure similar conditions. The sequence of test conditions was randomized and double-blind. In addition, a subjective rating scale was used. Result(s): Wearing foam ear plugs under the headset decreased speech intelligibility dramatically. The "hi-fi" plug was somewhat better than foam plugs, and the custom made ear plug provided a speech intelligibility close to the headset-only situation. Subjective rating scores coincided with these findings. Discussion(s): In helicopter noise, custom made ear plugs may provide a much improved speech intelligibility over conventional plugs when worn under a headset, while maintaining improved noise protection over the headset-alone situation. Custom made ear plugs might therefore be a good alternative to other forms of enhanced noise protection in helicopters.

AB  - Garbage collectors work at a mean equivalent continuous noise exposure level (L(Aeq,8h)) of 87 dB(A) and at a mean impulse-weighted noise exposure level (L(Al,8h)) of 94 dB(A). In 1991 a detailed interview, examination of the eardrums and tone audiometry (air and bone conduction) were carried out with 193 garbage collectors. In 1994/95 these workers underwent the same tests. After exclusion of all subjects with hearing loss that was not noise- induced, the simultaneous influence of different factors (duration-of noise exposure in garbage collection work and in other occupations, duration of the period without noise exposure before testing, age) on the variable 'hearing loss' was tested by multivariate regression analysis. A significant influence on hearing loss was found only for the factors 'duration of garbage collection work' and 'age'. The measured hearing loss was compared with the calculated hearing loss according to ISO 1999. For every subject, the difference (the error) between the actual hearing loss and the hearing loss which was calculated for various fictitious noise exposure levels, was squared. The (theoretical) noise exposure level with the lowest sum of squared differences in the frequencies 3, 4 and 6 kHz, also called the injury-equivalent noise exposure level, was found to be 94.5 dB(A). The equivalent continuous noise exposure level cannot sufficiently explain the risk to garbage collectors of acquiring hearing loss. Special risk due to impulse noise must be assumed. This risk can be adequately estimated with an impulse-weighted noise level (L(Al,8h)). Due to this special risk situation, it is necessary to reduce the noise exposure of garbage collectors and to enforce the wearing of ear protectors.

AB  - Vibrotactile thresholds were determined at 250 and 400 Hz in the presence of the sounds emitted by the vibrator, continuous tonal or narrow band masking noise, or a pulsed tone synchronized with the vibrator signal. The measure of a cross modality effect was the threshold shift occurring between each condition and the control condition, in which earmuff silencers eliminated the vibrator sounds. Continuous tones or noise had no effect upon vibrotactile thresholds. However, auditory signals synchronized with the vibrator signals did significantly elevate vibrotactile thresholds.

AB  - The helmet used in forestry today is the same as the helmet in industrial use. The eye protector, which is usually a face shield made from wire mesh, is fastened to the helmet. The aim of this study is to clarify the frequency of use of, the protection afforded by, and the need for improvement in the helmet and eye protector. These things were investigated by a questionnaire, an interview, observations, accident and near-accident reports, and user and laboratory tests. In 1980, 88% of the loggers always used a helmet, and 32% an eye protector. In principle, the use of helmet, eye protector and ear protector is compulsory during forest work in Finland. Of every 100 accidents in logging in 1980, 8 to 15 injured the head or eyes, according to official statistics and the questionnaire. Loggers reported that the helmet was too hot in summer and too cold in winter. The low utilization rate for eye protectors is partly explained by design defects: the protectors become frosted in winter; there is poor visibility through the protectors when it rains or when dark; the protectors cause glare in sunshine. Product development seems to be necessary so that the helmet and eye protector can better fulfill the special requirements of forestry.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how well humans localize sound sources in the horizontal plane while wearing protective headgear with and without hearing protection. In a source identification task, a stimulus was presented from 1 of 20 loudspeakers arrayed in a semicircular arc, and participants stated which loudspeaker emitted the sound. Each participant was tested in 8 conditions involving various combinations of wearing a Kevlar army helmet and two types of earplugs. Testing was conducted at each of 2 orientations (frontal and lateral). In the frontal orientation, overall error was slightly greater in all protected conditions than in the bare-head control condition. In the lateral orientation, overall error score in the protected conditions was substantially and significantly greater than in the bare-head control conditions. Most errors in the lateral orientation were accounted for by front-back confusions, indicating that the protective devices disrupted high-frequency spectral cues that are the basis for discriminating front from back sound sources. The results have practical implications for the use of protective headgear and earplugs in industrial or military environments where localization of critical sounds is important.

AB  - Background: Aircrews are often exposed to high ambient sound levels, especially in military aviation. Since long-term exposure to such noise may cause hearing damage, selection of adequate hearing protective devices is crucial. Such devices also affect speech intelligibility. When speech intelligibility and hearing protection lead to conflicting requirements, a compromise must be reached. The selection of personal equipment for RNLAF Chinook aircrews is taken as an example of this process. Method(s): Sound attenuation offered by aircrew helmets and ear plugs was measured using a standardized method. Sound attenuation results were used to calculate sound exposure. Objective predictions of speech intelligibility were calculated using the Speech Transmission Index (STI) method. Subjective preference was investigated through a survey among 28 experienced aircrew members. Result(s): The use of ear plugs in addition to a (RNLAF standard) helmet may lead to a significant reduction of sound exposure. Using ear plugs that offer high sound attenuation, instead of using a less attenuating type, gives a little additional reduction of sound exposure, at the expense of a large reduction in speech intelligibility. Hence, it is better to use 'light' ear plugs. Better performance still is offered by Communications Earplugs, ear plugs featuring integrated miniature earphones. Results from the user preference survey correspond well with objective measurement results. Conclusion(s): In the case of the RNLAF Chinook, the best solution is using Communications EarPlugs in combination with a standard helmet. The Chinook case clearly illustrates that hearing protection and speech intelligibility should be treated as connected issues.

AB  - In February 1973, the Secretary of Labor ordered that a committee be established to determine the necessary requirements of an effective hearing conservation program in the U.S. After a number of meetings in 1973, the Noise Advisory Committee presented its recommendations to the Secretary in December of the same year. The major issues which the Comittee addressed were: the lowering of the basic OSHA standard from 90dB(A) to 85dB(A), the necessity for audiometric testing as a part of a hearing conversation program, the requirements for the administration of such a program if it were required, and the requirements for personal hearing protectors if they were required for a hearing conservative program. It is concluded that this proposed standard makes no great changes in the present situation. It does, however, fill in many of the details which were dubious in the present OSHA standard. It will be basically no harder to comply with but it does detail the duties of both employers and employees in what is hoped to be an unequivocal manner.

AB  - When we sleep in noisy areas our delta sleep is reduced, our heart rate fails to habituate to individual noises, and we are more likely to develop psychic disturbances than residents in quiet areas. Data from these studies are however interspersed with results from a number of experiments during which the subject has been looked upon as nothing but a sleeper, i.e., experiments in which day-time stresses and noises were considered as irrelevant for the night-time study. It seems important therefore that future studies should gather more longitudinal data based on a limited number of subjects selected according to their day-time habits and psychological (e.g., extroverts/introverts) and physiological (e.g., short or long sleepers) characteristics. The knowledge about these situational factors and personality traits might provide new insights into individual biological strategies developed to cope with noise stress. The difficulties in assessing the effect of noise on sleep are particularly obvious if we consider another finding: deaf subjects spend significantly less time in delta sleep than do control subjects and they present sleep pattern alterations remarkably similar to those which are most consistently described in noisy conditions. The first question deal with in this paper is epidemiological: are there any differences in the patterns of drug consumption between populations living in areas with different noise levels? In view of the fact that some adaptation may occur in the course of long periods will then consider the effects of reducing night-time noise levels on the sleep patterns of subjects who have slept for years in a noisy environment. And conversely, what are the effects of creating noise during the night on the sleep patterns of normal subjects and, under these conditions, what are the physical characteristics of noise that appear to be the most sleep-disturbing? Last, but not least, are the sleep patterns of individuals who sleep in a noisy environment and who are subjectively well adaptated to it, completely 'normal'?

AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of noise, age and confounders in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Information about work exposure, the use of hearing protective devices, audiogram, environmental and biological factors was collected from 406 paper mill workers exposed to noise levels of 91-94 dB(A), 124 forest workers exposed to noise levels of 96-99 dB(A) and 176 shipyard workers exposed to noise levels 95-97 dB(A). In addition to noise exposure, we collected the following confounders: smoking habits, serum cholesterol, systolic or diastolic blood pressure and use of analgesics. Subjects were classified based on median values, into high- and low-risk groups. The confounders were a significant source of hearing loss (HL) in younger and elderly groups of subjects, serum cholesterol level being the most important. In risk analysis the confounders partly masked the effects of noise in the development of HL. For subjects with less than two confounders, occupational noise exposure determined the development of NIHL. As the number of confounders increased, the noise exposure was overruled by these factors in the development of HL. In analysis where the subjects were matched with pairs by age, exposure, blood pressure and serum cholesterol level, the elderly subjects were more susceptible to NIHL than younger subjects. Factors independently but causally related to age were important in the development of NIHL among workers exposed to noise levels below 98 dB(A).

AB  - Objectives: The study was done to determine whether the noise attenuation attained with the use of earplugs can be improved by teaching the proper insertion of earplugs to users. Method(s): Fifty-four randomly selected male subjects were divided into an untrained group (25 persons) and a trained group (29 persons). The trained group was given a lecture on earplug insertion and allowed to practise the insertion procedure, whereas the untrained group acted as controls. The untrained group received this training afterwards. The success of the training was measured by the MIRE (microphone in real ear) and REAT (real ear at threshold) methods, visual evaluation and an analysis of the properties of the subjects' ear canals. Result(s): According to the MIRE method, the averaged A-weighted noise attenuation was 21 dB for the untrained group and 31 dB for the trained group. With the REAT method the attenuation at 1000 Hz was 24 dB for the untrained group and 30 dB for the trained group. The visual evaluation of the earplug fit was 1.9 for the untrained group and 2.6 for the trained group (scales 0-3). Conclusion(s): The results indicate that training in earplug insertion is important for good attenuation and for diminishing poor attenuation to a minimum.

AB  - An exact measurement of the effectiveness of a hearing protector requires the determination of how well it works in the specific noise in which it is to be worn. As a practical matter, though, people do not generally remain in a single spectrum throughout a working career or even throughout a working day, so it does not matter so much that most measurers are not likely to be equipped to perform spectrum analyses. Other techniques for judging earplugs and earmuffs are obviously necessary. Previous research has tried to find the average attenuation given by a particular device in several (or many) noises, or it has tried to deal with the attenuation given in noises with particular C-minus-A values. In this paper, a procedure is developed for compressing these multiple-spectra calculations into a single-spectrum computation that proves to be at least as accurate as the more complex methods.

AB  - The attenuation of one specific ear protector was determined for a group of five normal hearing subjects and a group of five hearing impaired subjects. The hearing impaired group yielded significantly less attenuation than the normal hearing group. Since the measuring sound intensity level was high for the hearing impaired listeners and low for the normal listeners, it appears that a threshold procedure using normal subjects, as presented in the American standard (ANSI S3.19-1974), may overestimate the actual attenuation of ear protectors in most noisy environments.

AB  - Although industrial and recreational noise have been recognized as potential causes of noise-induced hearing loss for quite some time, it is only recently that the sound levels within a symphony orchestra have been implicated as possible sources of harmful noise levels. Many studies have concluded that not only are dangerous levels of noise present within the symphony orchestra, but there is evidence of noise-induced hearing loss among symphony orchestra musicians. Although hearing protection designed for industrial use may not be appropriate for the special listening needs of professional musicians, recent advances in hearing protection design have made hearing protection practical for this population. Suggestions are made for monitoring and protecting the professional ear.

AB  - Efficiency of 9 types of hearing protectors was investigated. A subjective method of an absolute hearing threshold shift in free sound field in 20 well-hearing-persons was applied. The results obtained are presented in figures. It was found that the maximum efficiency of most hearing protectors usually fell toon the frequency of 4000 Hz and amounted to 20--41 dB. The minimum efficiency usually fell to the frequency of 125 Hz and amounted to 8--21 dB. Attenuation efficiency of broad-band noise was 18-40 dB and approximated the maximum efficiency of pure sounds, sometimes even surpassing it. The results of determinations differed from the values given by manufacturers, which accounts for the need of undertaking such investigations.

AB  - In a factory involved in heavy industry, an investigation of noise levels was carried out; measurements were made of environmental noise, a questionnaire was given to the workers, and their hearing was tested with audiometer. The subjects were 795 male workers, 47.7 +/- 8.8 years of age (Mean +/- SD). There are many noisy machines in the factory: airblowers, sanders, steel-presses etc. Some of these put out high noise levels in operation, over 100dB (A) near the laborer's ear. About 60 percent of the laborers were working in a noise level below 85dB (A). Some are in the area of 85-90dB (A). There are a few laborers at the area over 90dB (A). The laborers had the following complaints: hearing loss (about 30 percent), tinnitus (15 percent), and dizziness (10 percent) etc. Hearing levels with 6 divided estimation method of many laborers were 15 to 19dB (25 percent) and 20 to 24dB (24 percent). Hearing levels become higher with aging. The group over 35 years of age showed higher hearing levels at sound frequency 4000Hz, i.e. such as c5 dip phenomenon. Most laborers are using ear plug, but some use them only occasionally. More industrial hygiene education should be given the laborers; routine noise measurements and regular medical checkups are needed.

AB  - A study of the noise generated by hand-held pneumatic rock drills at 15 road works locations in Hong Kong was conducted in 1989. The locations of road construction works were identified over one week period. Sound pressure levels (SPL) and band frequency analysis were measured with the integrated sound level meter at the level of the operator's ears. The sound levels for all 15 operators exceeded the local statutory limit of 90 dBA. The average sound level was 107.4 dBA and the corresponding continuous equivalent level adjusted to 8 hours or L(eq) (8h) was 104.8 dBA. The sound levels for the octave frequencies from 125 Hertz to 8000 Hertz were all in excess of 90 dBA. Estimates of the risk of developing hearing impairment for conversation speech among the operators were 18% and 42% after 5 and 10 years of exposure, respectively. Although there is adequate statutory control to restrict and reduce the hazards caused by noise at road construction works to the workers and to the public at large, no noise control measures were noted at the work sites and none of the operators used hearing protection. This situation was compounded by the short-term nature of road works and the high mobility of the operators.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the concentrations of oil mist and hydrocarbon vapor to which marine engineers are currently exposed. Measurements were also taken of the sound level in the engine room and the control rooms. Area mist concentration measurements were performed in 21 ferries, 2 cargo ships, and 2 westamaran (an express ship with two keels). Measurements were also performed for four different tasks where exposures above area level were expected. The area level of oil mist in the engine rooms of the different ships varied from not detectable to 0.53 mg/m3 (mean 0.24 mg/m3). The levels of hydrocarbons in the different ships varied from 0.2 to 14.5 mg/m3. The sound level varied from 96 to 108 dB(A) in the engine rooms, and from 70 to 90 dB(A) in the control room. When compared to other studies, it is supposed that the exposure to noise and mineral oil mist in the engine rooms of ships may represent a risk of adverse health effects for workers on Norwegian ships. The sound level may cause neurogenic hearing loss when appropriate hearing protection is not used.

AB  - More than one-half million construction workers are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of noise, yet federal and state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs provide little incentive to protect them against noise-induced hearing loss. Construction noise regulations lack the specificity of general industry noise regulations. In addition, problems that characterize the construction industry, such as worker mobility and the large proportion of small businesses, make implementing hearing conservation measures more difficult. The apparent severity of exposure depends greatly on the measurement method, with the 3-dB exchange rate almost always showing higher average exposure levels than the 5-dB (OSHA) rule. Construction workers demonstrate hearing threshold levels that generally conform to those expected in manufacturing. The prevalence of hearing protection device (HPD) use among U.S. construction workers is very poor, partly because of perceived difficulties in hearing and understanding speech communication and warning signals. In addition, masking by noise of necessary communication and warning signals is of particular concern in construction, where recent research demonstrated the association between fatalities and the failure to hear reverse alarms. Judicial use of HPDs is of the utmost importance, along with avoiding overattenuation, selecting HPDs with uniform attenuation, and using noise-attenuating communication systems when possible. A successful hearing conservation program in British Columbia can serve as a model for the United States, with a long-standing positive safety culture, a high percentage of HPD use, improvement in average hearing threshold levels over the last decade, and a centralized record-keeping procedure, which helps solve the problem of worker mobility. However, controlling construction noise at the source is the most reliable way to protect worker hearing. U.S. manufacturers and contractors should benefit from the activities of the European Community, where noise control and product labeling in construction has been carried out for more than 20 years.

AB  - A survey is given elaborating the problems of connecting intensity and duration when rating stress. At first, examples of heat stress elucidate the difficulty of the combination of stressor height and stressor duration, when considering all the problems involved from a human-physiological point of view. Furthermore the principle of 'equal work', which comprises just this integral rating method, is shown to be a physical and not a physiological method or way of thinking. A varying duration-time of stress, however, always necessitates a consideration of the 'biological cost' for the strain identification, which e.g. has an effect on methods for the calculation of strain-oriented recovery times. Some critical remarks follow with regard to the dose principle, which assumes that it is only the quantity of a harmful agent which is decisive for injurious effects. In reality, however, a noxa of the same physical quantity acting during a shorter period has to be regarded more dangerous and injurious for health, because the exceeding of physiological barriers becomes more probable at an increasing density of energy or a concentration of harmful substances in case of focussing the energy. The equilibration of stressor height and duration and the mutual settlement of those two factors respectively, basing on an 8-hour working day, may easily lead to a concealment of complex multi-dimensional connections and to perhaps different mechanisms of the effects on man. Examples of noise stress show the contradictory objectives between the requirement of practical work by easily applicable rating and evaluation methods on the one hand and the human-scientific responsibility on the other hand. Some risks of actual methods of occupational health protection and necessary consequences (e.g. with regard to the evaluation of effective noise insulation values of hearing protection) are indicated. Several examples of application illustrate the weakness of equal energy hypothesis of environmental stress, showing that in the upper and lower areas of the strain-time-continuum, physiology can no longer 'join' - except the organism would have sufficiently large temporal and spatial possibilities of buffer. Directives and limiting lines, in a double-logarithmic scale, have to be regarded to be of a special problematic nature, the consequences of which are only seldom known by practitioners. In a relatively tight net of rules and regulations (as a perceptible evidence of manifold efforts for occupational health protection) security and transparency of already existing rules with regard to human aspects as well as a problem-adequate application is considered to be more important than additional new rules and regulations. This comprises a necessary revision of regulations from time to time by taking into account the updated essential knowledge of research in the effects on human beings as well as the preparation of application instructions.

AB  - Noise from woodworking machinery, particularly circular saws, can often reach 110 to 120 dB at the operator's ear. This will, in the absence of ear protection, ultimately cause noise-induced deafness. A series of experiments was undertaken in which the laterally-induced forced vibrations, which radiate noise from the saw when cutting, were reduced. This was achieved by placing plates very close to each side of the circular saw, under the bench and supported by air bearings. Using semicircular plates, a reduction of 16 dB could be achieved; using smaller circular plates - a considerably cheaper alternative - a reduction of 6 to 8 dB was achieved.

AB  - Starting from the results gained in obligatory audiometrical control examinations of ship engine operators carried out every two years, the situation of this group is presented for the period 1969-1973. For this purpose the frequency of hearing losses concerning test frequency was ascertained in each case from individual audiometric findings (in total 4,522) in each year; they were represented in the form of collective audiograms. In comparison to other noise groups they show relatively small hearing losses. In addition to short noise exposure time in all years, the carrying of individual ear protectors which has gained way is considered to be the cause of the above mentioned findings.

AB  - Objectives: Objectives were to perform exact measurements of the noise exposure in a magnetic resonance imager and to investigate the effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) noise on hearing sensitivity, which are still controversial, in a large number of patients. Study Design: Prospective trial. Method(s): Acoustic noise during seven different MRI sequences was measured using a custom-made microphone containing no ferromagnetic parts. In 244 ears of 126 patients, pure-tone audiometry was performed once before and once after MRI noise, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were measured once before and three times after MRI. Result(s): The sound pressure level (SPL) at the patient's ear (with consideration of the sound-damping effect of the head support) ranged from 79.5 to 86.5 dB (A), depending on the MRI sequence, with brief sound pressure peaks up to 120 dB SPL. No significant incidence of temporary threshold shift and no reduction of mean distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude were apparent. However, a significant increase in distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude variability after noise exposure with equal distribution of increased and decreased amplitudes was observed. This variability showed a maximum at 15 minutes after noise, as demonstrated by continuous measurements. Conclusion(s): First, MRI noise does not impose a risk to hearing function under the measurement condition of a sound-damping head support or ear protectors. Second, a subtle effect is demonstrated by increased distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude variability. Third, the increased otoacoustic emission amplitude variability is an audiometric parameter that is extremely sensitive to effects of acoustic stimulation, indicating more discrete changes in cochlear activity than pure-tone audiometry or otoacoustic emission amplitude reduction. A shift of the operation point (OP) of the outer hair cell (OHC) between basilar membrane and tectorial membrane is suggested as underlying cause.

AB  - Impulse noise causes evidently more severe hearing loss than steady state noise. The additional effect of occupational impulse noise on hearing has been shown to be from 5 to 12 dB at 4 kHz audiometric frequency. Reported cases for compensated for hearing loss are prevalent in occupations where noise is impulsive. For impulse noise two measurement methods have been proposed: the peak level method and energy evaluation method. The applicability of the peak level method is difficult as even the recurrent impulses have different time and frequency characteristics. Various national risk criteria differ from international risk criteria. In France the maximum A-weighted peak level is 135 dB, and in the United Kingdom the C-weighted peak sound pressure is limited to 200 Pa (140 dB). This criterion of unweighted 200 Pa (140 dB) is used in European Union (EU) directive 86/188 and ISO 1999-1990 regardless of the number of impulses. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has recommended that no exposure in excess of a C-weighted peak sound pressure level of 140 dB should be permitted. At work places these norms do not cause any practical consequences since the impulses seldom exceed 140 dB peak level. In several occupations the impulses are so rapid that they contribute only a minimal amount to the energy content of noise. These impulses can damage the inner ear even though they cause reduced awareness of the hazard of noise. Based to the present knowledge it is evident that there is the inadequacy of the equal energy principle in modelling the risk for hearing loss. The hearing protectors attenuate industrial impulse noise effectively due to the high frequency contents of impulses. Directive regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from noise requires that in risk assessment attention should be paid also to impulsive noise. So far there is no valid method to combine steady state and impulse noise. A statistical method for the measurements of industrial impulse noise is needed to get a preferably single number for risk assessment. There is an urgent task to develop risk assessment method and risk criteria for impulsive noise to meet the requirements of the upcoming European Union noise directive.

AB  - The present study was carried out to determine whether impulse noise and simultaneous exposure to noise and vibration can aggravate sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL) among forest (N = 199) and shipyard (N = 171) workers. The average level of exposure to noise outside the used earmuffs and the average exposure over time were nearly equal for the two groups. The impulsiveness of the noise and the average exposure level inside the earmuffs were measured with a miniature microphone. The hearing threshold of the workers was measured at 4 kHz and then estimated according to Robinson's model to compare the observed and expected hearing loss. The impulsiveness of the noise was greater both outside and inside the earmuffs in shipyard work than in forest work. The average SNHL was higher than predicted for the shipyard workers and about the same as predicted for the forest workers. The total exposure level inside the earmuffs was influenced by the total wearing time. The low frequencies of the chain-saw noise were not attenuated sufficiently by the earmuffs to protect the workers' hearing. The present study suggests that exposure to impulse noise increases the risk of SNHL, but that simultaneous exposure to hand-arm vibration and noise does not.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of custom-molded earplugs in preventing hearing threshold shifts over a long period of time. A stepwise regression analysis was employed to accomodate job related variables including workplace noise level, demographic elements including age, and factors related to hearing including ear history. These variables would be expected to exert considerable influence on hearing threshold shifts. However, workplace noise level absorbed unexpected small amounts of variation in hearing threshold shifts for the textile worker subjects (N=1517) even when noise level was entered as the only variable on the first step for each analysis. And, baseline hearing values absorbed unexpected large amounts even when entered on the last step. An argument based on these findings in presented suggesting that custom-fitted hearing protection was effective in preventing substantial changes in hearing threshold level during the period of this investigation.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was twofold: (1) to determine the physical characteristics of five types of foam earplugs; and (2) to relate their physical characteristics to attenuation of noise. The results indicate that: (1) all commercial polymer foam earplugs have similar physical properties, (2) frequency (Hz) is the single most important variable in determining attenuation of commercial foam earplugs, (3) all earplugs evaluated provided essentially the same attenuation at frequencies >= 500 Hz. One non-commercial earplug provided significantly more attenuation at 125 Hz than the other earplugs. This non-commercial experimental plug has significantly different physical and chemical properties. No other consistent effects of physical properties on attenuation were found.

AB  - The purposes of this investigation were two-fold: to determine whether differences between measured ear canal diameter and actual earplug size affect sound pressure levels in the ear canal during exposure to high levels of noise; and to determine if individuals would select the insert earplugs that conform to their measured ear canal diameter if the decision were left to them. The results indicate that: very small differences between measured ear canal diameter and actual earplug size affect considerably the sound pressure levels in the ear canal during exposure to high levels of noise; individuals typically select earplugs that are smaller than their measured ear canal dimensions when the decision is left to them; the most skilled technician cannot always determine ear canal sizes due to limitations of available measuring instruments.

AB  - Introduction: Psychophysical measures of wet-suit hood sound attenuation are needed to provide the diving community with guidance on protection from underwater sound. Method(s): Underwater hearing thresholds were obtained from 15 male and 5 female recreational divers with and without a 3-mm thick wet-suit hood. Dives were conducted at a depth of 1 m in a large quiet anechoic pool. Thresholds were determined using a two-interval forced-choice procedure with a 0.71 probability of positive response at convergence. A 1-s pure tone was presented with a 20-ms rise and fall time at 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 Hz. Result(s): Without a wet-suit hood, mean thresholds decreased from 99 dB re 1 muPa at 100 Hz to 85 dB at 500 Hz. Thresholds were statistically similar at 100 to 300 Hz with and without the wet-suit hood, but were significantly increased at 400 and 500 Hz with the hood (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, at shallow depths, a 3-mm neoprene wet-suit hood attenuates underwater sound by approximately 10 dB for frequencies between 400 Hz and 500 Hz. At frequencies below 400 Hz, a 3-mm neoprene wet-suit hood offers no sound protection.

AB  - The attempt to predict the hazard of impulse (weapon) noise to the human ear by means of mathematical models is made in many international studies. Most of the common models infer the damage risk for the human ear from animal models. This kind of conclusion contains many uncertainties. Recent changes of the measuring devices, e.g. the use of artificial heads, improved recording and analyzing of the physical data of weapon blasts considerably. Acquiring data with an artificial head offers the possibility to measure the 'realistic' sound pressure level reaching the human ear as well as the 'realistic' attenuation of any hearing protection device without involving human subjects and exposing them to a possible risk for health. In order to develop such a model for the prediction of health hazards, a large amount of data on human responses to high energetic impulse noise is needed. In a series of field studies, the effects of different kinds of weapon shots on a large set of physiological and biochemical parameters are investigated. First results indicate that the finger-pulse amplitude and the norepinephrine level in blood plasma show clear responses to the impulse noise stimuli corresponding with the intensity of the strain.

AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) during focal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising approach to study cortical connectivity in awake humans. However, the noise caused by the discharging magnetic coil might have confounding effects on the rTMS-related cortical activation pattern. In twelve healthy volunteers, 18-fluoro-2- deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) PET was employed to visualize the functional activation of the primary auditory cortex (PAC) during 2 Hz rTMS of the left primary sensorimotor hand area. Magnetic stimuli (1800) were applied at an intensity of 140% of motor resting threshold during the uptake period of 18FDG. Though all subjects wore earplugs, rTMS-related noise induced a consistent bilateral increase of regional glucose utilization in the PAC (P < 0.05, corrected). Thus, rTMS-related acoustic input needs to be taken into account in combined rTMS/PET studies.

AB  - 1. The objective of the study: The main purpose of the study was the collection of data which could be used to promote and motivate the use of ear protectors in the paper industry. The results of the study should be especially useful when introducting workers to the use of ear protectors, and when attempting to improve the design and construction of ear protectors. 2. Methods and subjects. Data concerning 237 workers from a paper mill in southern Finland was collected by means of a questionnaire. 3. Result(s): 104 workers claimed to suffer from diagnosed hearing loss. The frequency of hearing loss reported particularly increased afer 10-19 years of working in noisy surroundings, this regardless of the age of the workers. The frequency of hearing loss among workers exposed to a noise level of 95-100 dB (A) was somewhat higher than among workers exposed to either 85-90 dB (A) or 90-95 dB (A); the difference, however, was not statistically significant. The 47 workers who used ear cups experienced, e.g. following inconveniences caused by the ear cups: the cups press, they cause perspiration, they make it difficult to hear speech. 172 workers used ear plugs. The worst disadvantage to using ear plugs was the hygienic danger of wearing dirty ear plugs. As many as 183 workers occasionally worked without ear protectors. The following reasons for not using protectors were given: slight risk of hearing loss (44%); difficult to hear instructions (42%); perspiration (34%); neglected putting them on (26%); protectors forgotten somewhere (25%). 4. Conclusions. More attention must be paid to instructing workers on the proper use of ear protectors. They must be better informed about the risk of hearing loss when they use protectors only some of the time. More attention must also be paid to the selection, fitting and maintenance of ear protectors.

AB  - The degree of damage due to sound (noise) depends upon the volume (intensity), the duration of exposure, the frequency, the character of the noise and on various individual factors. At a noise intensity of 85 dB/A and beyond, and with a long period of exposure, as a result of an exhaustion of the respiratory enzyme depot, initially a temporary, but after a longer period of exposure a permanent, drop in the hearing threshold curve occurs at about 4 kHz. The speech intelligibility becomes affected only after years of exposure to noise. In order to prevent such noise induced damage, recognition and measurement of the ear damaging noise is necessary. A noise diminishment can be achieved by a reduction of the noise generated, by preventing its propagation and by improving working techniques. Since, despite all the efforts to achieve a noise diminishment by technical means, there will always be work places at which noise induced hearing impairment is to be expected, hearing must be protected by the wearing of ear defenders. On account of the individual variation in sensitivity to noise, the variation in the noise exposure and the fact that ear protectors are not always consistently worn, a regular, pure tone audiometric examination of the hearing of noise endangered employees carried out every 1 to 3 years is necessary. The employer should instruct his employees on the ear damaging effect of noise and the necessity of wearing ear defenders at the start of 'noisy' work, and then from time to time, through the mediation of the factory doctor, safety engineer, etc. Employees suffering from a high degree of hearing loss are, in most industrial countries, paid a compensation and, at the same time, counselled to change their work place. In order to improve speech intelligibility in employees with severe noise induced hearing damage, a hearing aid can be used. This aid, however, must be worn only when working conditions are quiet or in the private sphere but not at 'noisy' places. This hearing aid should have only a moderate level of amplification, an amplification limiting facility and frequency characteristics favouring the medium and higher frequencies.

AB  - A study has been made about the noise situation on 391 merchant sea ships with 9040 A-valued sound levels and on 79 inland vessels with 496 sound levels. The average sound levels, for instance, have been compared, depending on the years in which the ships have been built, or on the revolutions of the main engine shaft. Separated comparisons were made for the working and recreational areas of the sea ships and inland vessels. Those equivalent duration sound levels have been measured on the engineers, master mechanics and assistents of the 34 merchant sea ships with noise dose meters at a daily eight hours working tome, so the average of the individual sound load has been determined. 86% and more of durating sound levels stayed over L(eq)=89 dB(A). The duration sound levels of the engineers have been excluded. Less than 40% of the technicians wear an ear protector in spite of the high sound load. Only on 4 of 22 inland vessels were ear protectors available. The results of the audiometry on 324 technicians of those sea ships was that 21% of them were already injured caused by the sound loads on board. Furthermore, the noise problems will be discussed caused by the given sound signals and the noise abatement will be pointed out.

AB  - The primary goal of medical and nursing management in the traumatic brain-injured patient is to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Little is known about what effect, if any, auditory stimulation has on these parameters. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effects of various auditory stimuli on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in traumatic brain-injured patients. A convenience sample of fifteen participants with admitting Glasgow Coma Scale scores between 3 and 8 was studied. Three types of auditory stimuli: earplugs, a music tape and a tape of ICU environmental noise were applied to patients in a computer-generated random order. The tapes delivered sound at 70 decibels. Each intervention lasted 15 minutes. ICP and CPP were recorded at a 30 second resolution time through a bedside computer. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance for a cross over design. Results showed no statistically significant change in ICP or CPP during the study period. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of auditory stimuli on ICP and CPP in traumatic brain-injured patients.

AB  - Most noise control methods rely on the usual palliatives of either personal hearing protection or noise enclosures. Other methods include reducing the time that employees spend in the noise by shift rotation or modifying the acoustics of the factory space. All of these methods are mainly cosmetic, often involve high, ongoing costs, reduce production time (and hence profits) and, at best, only cover up the real problem - the noise. Noise control at source is the only method that can avoid hearing damage in the long term. This paper shows how correctly implemented noise control at source can reduce machine wear, increase tool life, increase production speeds and increase profits. The most expensive option is to ignore the problem and hope it will go away on its own - it won't.

AB  - The audiometric test data of 265 employees in one facility were studied to determine group mean hearing threshold changes. The data covered seven to thirteen years. During this time the population was exposed to workplace noise (OSHA) exposures of 86 to 103 dBA. Personal hearing protection was used. Essentially no change in the mean threshold hearing level was found. Certain other hearing conservation program effectiveness indicators also were used to evaluate this population. The results of these indicators were used to evaluate this population also. The results of these indicators generally follow the trends for effective programs.

AB  - Purpose: This paper reports the results of a comprehensive noise survey of the Sikorsky S-70A-9 Black Hawk helicopter environment and provides an assessment of the hearing protection devices worn by Australian Army personnel exposed to that environment. Methods and Results: At-ear noise levels were measured at 4 positions in the cabin of the Black Hawk under various flight conditions and at 13 positions outside the Black Hawk under various ground running conditions using the Head Acoustic Measurement System (Head, GmbH). The attenuation properties of the hearing protection devices (HPDs) normally worn by aircrew and maintenance crews (the ALPHA helmet and the Roanwell MX-2507 Communications headset) were also assessed. At-ear sound pressure levels that would be experienced by personnel wearing their normal HPDs were determined at the positions they would normally occupy in and around the aircraft. Conclusion(s): Results indicate that HPDs do not provide adequate hearing protection to meet current hearing conservation regulations which allow a permissible noise exposure of 85 dB(A) for an 8-h day.

AB  - Personal noise exposures of classical musicians in the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, Centennial Concert Hall, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, were conducted to determine compliance with provincial standards. In Manitoba, a hearing conservation program is required where the equivalent sound exposure level (Lex 8-hour) exceeds 80 dB A-weighted sound pressure level [dB(A)]. In excess of 85 and 90 dB(A), standards require hearing protection and engineering or work practice controls. Approximately 10 percent of the musicians wore conventional or custom-molded earplugs. Dosimetry readings were taken in the rehearsal room, main stage, and orchestra pit during rehearsals and dress rehearsals. Quest model M-8B and Larson Davis model 700 dosimeters were used and the Canadian Standards Association procedure was applied. The mean Lex 8-hour for the rehearsal room surveys were 88 and 90 dB(A), for the pit were 85 and 86 dB(A), and for the main stage were 82, 84, and 88 dB(A). Instantaneous peak exposures were recorded in excess of 140 dB(A). Individual noise exposure data indicated that the musicians' Lex 8- hour decreased with distance from the woodwind and brass sections. Neither the playing environments (stage, pit, rehearsal room) nor the musical repertoire resulted in an appreciable difference in the mean Lex 8-hour exposure in a fully complemented orchestra. Noise exposures for musicians of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra were in excess of all three Manitoba standards.

AB  - Audiometric data base analysis (ADBA) offers the most direct means of judging the effectiveness of a hearing conservation program (HCP) in preventing occupational hearing loss. However, numerous factors need to be accounted for if the findings are to be meaningful. This paper discusses several parameters known to influence the interpretation of group data statistics in assessing HCP effectiveness. Testing factors that may affect the stability of the data base include audiometric techniques, calibration procedures, testing environment, and the motivation and prior experience of the subject. Pertinent population parameters include age, sex, race, current and prior noise exposures, learning effects, and the types of hearing protectors in use. Two case histories are presented to illustrate the aplication of ADBA techniques. Specific analysis procedures reviewed include comparisons of mean thresholds for selected industrial and nonindustrial populations, rates of change in mean hearing levels over a period of time, baseline and sequential test-retest comparisons, and different threshold shift criteria. The preliminary results of ADBA research being done by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S12.12 Working Group are summarized, including desirable criterion ranges for several statistics established by applying them to control data sets.

AB  - A model of external- and middle-ear function is described that uses existing data to quantify the flow of sound power from the environment to the cochlea of humans, cats, and chinchillas. This model estimates the sound power produced at the entrance of the cochlea by an environmental sound stimulus, and can be used to predict the shape of the auditory threshold function and the relative potency of various traumatic acoustic stimuli. The shapes of the predicted and measured threshold functions in the three species are similar in best frequency, bandwidth, and low-frequency slope, and the model accurately predicts the hypersensitivity of the middle-frequency regions of the cochlea to acoustic trauma. The model assumes that the mechanics of the middle-ear system are linear even at high stimulus levels and does not include the effects of either middle-ear or cochlear efferent loops. The effects of these simplifications on the model are discussed as are the implications of the model results for hearing protection and damage risk criteria.

AB  - This review is a compilation of 11 investigations by different authors regarding the progression of hearing deterioration during severe long-term exposure to noise in mines, shipyards, forges, weaving mills, other factories and industries and from field artillery and hunting. With one exception, the reports concern conditions at times when ear protection was virtually unknown or only seldom used. The different investigations are described in a broad outline with their essential measurement and background data. For the first eight studies the results of the hearing deterioration with increasing exposure time are illustrated in figures showing, on the one hand, the original data and, on the other, the progression of hearing loss with increasing age, though reduced by the ISO 1999 (1990) values from database A for the normal threshold of hearing as a function of age. This is followed by a discussion of the results and a compilation of the data from the 11 investigations for, particularly, a noise exposure time of about 5 to 10 years, corresponding to an age of around 30 years, in comparison with an exposure time of 30 to 40 years, i.e. at an age range of about 50 to 60 years. Despite the great diversity in the character and level of the noise, the compilation shows for the higher ages in the range of 3 to 8 kHz a similar median hearing loss from nearly all investigations, however, at 1 kHz and, particularly, at 2 kHz the differences in the character of the noise are apparent in a wide spread of the median hearing loss between the different studies. In addition, it was found that at higher ages and hearing loss levels of more than 45 to 50 dB it is not possible to distinguish between the effect of the noise, on the one hand, and that of ageing, on the other; the ad hoc assumption of their additivity is no longer valid and thus the term 'age correction' inadequate. A series of further figures illustrates the progression of the hearing loss with exposure time in the different investigations at particularly 1 kHz, 2 kHz and 4 kHz. These groups of curves differ greatly regarding the average increase in hearing loss during the first 10 to 12 years of noise exposure, from about 5 to 9 dB per decade of exposure at 1 kHz to about 20 dB at 2 kHz and 35 to 50 dB at 4 kHz, however, during the following 20 to 30 years of work in the noise the further increase is fairly similar, at 1 kHz on an average 5 to 6 dB per decade and at 2 and 4 kHz 7 to 10 dB per decade. Also presented is the progression of the hearing loss for the pure-tone average of 0.5, 1 and 2 kHz and the average of 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz. The average course of the mean of the 0.5, 1 and 2 kHz values was found very similar to that of the 1 kHz curves and of the mean of the 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz values similar to that of the 2 kHz curves.

AB  - An original computer-fitted diagnosis system for registration of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is presented and compared with the tested persons' subjective hardness of hearing. Among 6904 brewery workers it was found that people below 40 years only contract little NIHL during the first 5 years of noise exposure. The NIHL after more than 5 years of noise exposure is of the same magnitude as the hearing loss resulting from 10-20 years of age. The NIHL in older age groups was of a minor degree. Permanent use of hearing protectors was associated with good hearing, but the data suggest that good hearing might be the cause and not the effect of the use of hearing protection.

AB  - In this study, the Health Promotion Model (HPM) was used as the basis for a structural equation model of male and female blue collar workers' self-reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Overall use did not differ by gender; in addition, self-efficacy and barriers to use of HPDs were the two best predictors of this behavior for both men and women. Despite the similarities in HPD use and the most important predictors of that use between men and women, the predictive models differed by gender in several ways. Significant predictors of use among men also included age and value of use of HPDs. For women, ethnic status and plant site were additional significant predictors of use. Because the influences of plant site and gender on self-reported use of HPDs could not be separated in this study, further research should address worksite culture and assess differences by gender. Knowledge of these differences will aid development of more effective interventions and may increase the use of hearing protection.

AB  - An experiment was conducted wherein masked thresholds (using ascending method of limits) for a backup alarm were obtained in pink and red noise at 85 and 100 dBA for 12 participants immersed in a probability monitoring task and wearing a conventional passive hearing protection device (HPD, an earmuff or a foam earplug), an active noise reduction (ANR) headset, or no HPD at all (only in 85 dBA noise). Results revealed statistically significant between-HPD differences in red noise (from 2.3 to 3.1 dB) and in the 100-dBA noise level (from 2.6 to 4.3 dB). An additional finding, which corroborates other studies using different protocols, was that masked thresholds in 85-dBA noise were significantly lower (from 3.2 to 4.4 dB) for the occluded conditions (wearing an HPD) than for the open-ear (unoccluded) condition. This result refutes the belief among many normal-hearing workers that the use of HPDs in relatively low levels of noise compromises their ability to hear necessary workplace sounds. Actual or potential applications of this research include (a) the selection of appropriate HPDs for low-frequency-biased noise exposures wherein signal detection is important and (b) gaining insight into the appropriateness of ANR-based HPDs for certain industrial noise environments.

AB  - The question of whether or not an individual suffering from a hearing loss is capable of hearing an auditory alarm or warning is an extremely important industrial safety issue. The ISO Standard that addresses auditory warnings for workplaces requires that any auditory alarm or warning be audible to all individuals in the workplace; including those suffering from a hearing loss and/or wearing hearing protection devices (HPDs). Research was undertaken to determine how the ability to detect an alarm or warning signal changed for individuals with normal hearing and two levels of hearing loss as the levels of masking noise and alarm were manipulated. Pink noise was used as the masker and a heavy-equipment reverse alarm was used as the signal. The rating method paradigm of signal detection theory was used as the experimental procedure to separate the subjects' absolute sensitivities to the alarm from their individual criteria for deciding to respond in an affirmative manner. Results indicated that even at a fairly low signal-to-noise ratio (O dB), subjects with a substantial hearing loss [a pure-tone average (PTA) hearing level of 45-50 dBHL in both ears] were capable of hearing the reverse alarm while wearing a high-attenuation earmuff in the pink noise used in the study.

AB  - In response to the need for a field-usable method for the measurement of hearing protector attenuation, a new procedure called bone conduction loudness balance has been developed. This procedure measures attenuation as the difference caused by the heating protector in the levels of an air- conducted sound required to balance the loudness of a bone-conducted reference sound. A feasibility assessment was carried out in which the attenuation of an expandable foam earplug was measured in four subjects for frequencies from 250 through 4000 Hz using two variations of the loudness balance procedure and a pure-tone, threshold-difference assessment for comparison. All test sounds were produced by a personal computer with an analog-digital sound processor, with the level being controlled by subject response. Standard audiometric headphones were used for the air conduction sounds and the bone conduction sound was produced from a vibrator held to the subjects' foreheads. The bone conduction sound was either a pure tone of the same frequency as the air conduction sound or a 1/3 octave noise band at 2000 Hz. The mean difference in attenuation measurement over all frequencies between the loudness balance and threshold difference methods was 3.1 dB with a standard deviation of 6.5 dB, and with the noise-band loudness balance method showing a trend toward greater error as the frequency decreased. In terms of repeatability, administration time, and subjects' acceptance, all the methods were approximately equal.

AB  - An existing hearing conservation program (HCP), originally designed when an 8-hr work shift schedule was in effect, was evaluated at a plant site where a 12-hr work shift schedule is now utilized. The study included the following phases: a noise analysis of the work environment, HCP evaluation through the use of audiometric data base analysis (ADBA), applying ADBA procedures and a compairosn of the shift in hearing threshold levels (HTLs) for the 8-hr and 12-hr work shifts, and an evaluation of the hearing protection devices (HPDs) being used at the facility of the 12-hr work shift by measuring temporary threshold shift (TTS). The mean measured employee time-weighted average (TWA) in the process area where the TTS study was conducted was 92 dBA. It was found that the existing HCP is at best marginal. The most likeley causes of this less-than-desirable rating are inadequate audiometric testing procedures and inadequate HPD utilization. Furthermore, it was concluded that, at this time, the introduction of the 12-hr work shift has had no impact on the level of effectiveness of he HCP. In evaluating the three HPDs in use at the facility (3-M foam earplug, E-A-R foam earplug, and Bilsom Soft earplug), it was found that they all offered effective protection from noise at all audiometric test frequencies (0.5 to 6 kHz) except 0.5 kHz. All three HPDs exhibited TTS at 0.5 kHz with the TTS measured significant at the p < 0.05 level for the E-A-R and 3-M wearer groups.

AB  - The authors examined whether hostility would negatively be associated with occupational health behavior, namely, the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Also examined as possible mediators were the protection motivation theory (PMT) components and low frustration tolerance (LFT). Participants were 226 male industrial workers, all exposed to potentially hearing-damaging noise. Hostility was negatively related to HPD use. It moderately correlated with the PMT components: negatively with perceived susceptibility, severity, effectiveness, and self-efficacy and positively with perceived barriers. Hostility correlated highly with LFT. Regression analyses confirmed the mediating role of perceived barriers, low self-efficacy, and LFT in the negative relationship between hostility and the use of HPDs. Thus, intrapsychic characteristics of hostile people may be significant for hearing protection behavior.

AB  - Noise-exposed employees with limited English skills may pose a special challenge for hearing conservation programs. This pilot field study assessed knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding use of hearing protective devices in a largely Hispanic group of 88 workers exposed to industrial noise. Effectiveness of hearing protection was determined through field measurements of personal attenuation ratings. Individual scores on an acculturation scale (first language learned, language at home, degree of literacy in English, preferred language) demonstrated a correlation between a low degree of acculturation and low personal attenuation rating (R2=0.49, p=0.0001). Low acculturation was also correlated with high-perceived barriers to use of hearing protection (p=0.006). Although neither self reports of self-efficacy nor perceived benefits of hearing protection correlated with personal attenuation rating, perceived barriers to hearing protector use was a significant predictor of hearing protector fit (p=0.05). These results indicate that less acculturated workers may be underutilizing hearing protection in the workplace partly due to perceived barriers to use of hearing protective devices. To be effective, hearing conservation training programs in work sites with an immigrant work force need to address language and cultural barriers to the use of hearing protection.

AB  - Hearing loss caused by exposure to recreational and occupational noise results in devastating disability that is virtually 100 percent preventable. Noise-induced hearing loss is the second most common form of sensorineural hearing deficit, after presbycusis (age-related hearing loss). Shearing forces caused by any sound have an impact on the stereocilia of the hair cells of the basilar membrane of the cochlea; when excessive, these forces can cause cell death. Avoiding noise exposure stops further progression of the damage. Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented by avoiding excessive noise and using hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs. Patients who have been exposed to excessive noise should be screened. When hearing loss is suspected, a thorough history, physical examination and audiometry should be performed.

AB  - We have developed a database and an analysis program (NoiseScan) for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The exposure data are based on the evaluation of the noise immission level, which includes duration, frequency content, and the use of, and the attenuation performance of, hearing protectors. The input data can handle an unlimited number of exposure periods. If the noise exposure level is not known, the program lists noise levels of comparable work places, and thus provides an estimate of exposure. Confounding medical factors that may contribute to NIHL, such as elevated serum cholesterol level, hypertension, and extensive use of pain killers, are collected. Combined exposure to agents that clearly contribute to NIHL, such as hand-arm vibration, tobacco smoking, use of aminoglycosides and exposure to solvents are also assessed. An unlimited number of audiograms can be stored, and all the data can be completed and edited following collection. The program gives the predicted hearing loss according to the ISO 1999 model based on total exposure. At present, our NoiseScan program (under continuous development in an EU research program) is suitable for the data collection of various risk factors. It can be used to determine whether the hearing loss is occupational in origin and to estimate the efficiency of hearing conservation measures. NoiseScan also predicts the development of hearing loss in individuals in 5-year periods. The goal is to improve and validate the rules by which single and combined risk factors contribute to HIHL, thus leading to more precise prediction of individual hearing loss, and for the evaluation of success of the hearing conservation programs.

AB  - A detailed analysis of risk factors for the development of sensory-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was carried out on 122 forest workers. These forest workers were selected from a larger group (n = 217) by restricting the age range to 30-55 years. The hearing threshold of the left ear at 4000 Hz was measured and the effect of age, exposure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), presence of vibration-induced white finger (VWF), tobacco smoking and use of earmuffs were evaluated in multiple linear regression analysis. Robinson's nonlinear model was used to evaluate the rate of hearing loss. Aging was the major risk factor and it explained 15.4% of the variance of the SNHL. The presence of VWF was the second most important single risk factor and explained a further 5.2% of the SNHL. Elevation of DBP correlated significantly with SNHL and explained an additional 4.1% of the SNHL. These main factors were able to explain about 26% of the spread of SNHL. Additional factors in the analysis, e.g. smoking, systolic blood pressure, did not significantly contribute to the genesis of SNHL. When Robinson's model was applied to the SNHL data, on a group basis, we did not observe any exaggerated risk of hearing loss due to combination of noise and vibration. In combined exposure subjects with VWF as well as subjects with enhanced DBP will run a higher risk for SNHL.

AB  - This study investigated a questionnaire that assesses workers' perceptions of noise at work. From an original pool of 33 questions, the 20-item Noise at Work Questionnaire was developed. Items were eliminated based on the responses of 45 employees from three workplaces. The questionnaire has good overall reliability and contains five subscales that evaluate: the perceived benefits of reducing noise and protecting hearing; the perceived barriers to reducing noise; perceived self-efficacy for reducing noise and protecting hearing; attitudes to noise; and perceived susceptibility to hearing loss. Subject education level, work type, work level, self-reported hearing loss and communication difficulties did not influence questionnaire results. Factors that related to questionnaire subscale scores were: having a hearing test through work; use of hearing protectors; type of workplace; age; and English language used at home. The questionnaire can be used as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention programs in changing workers' perceptions about noise.

AB  - Ever since Armstrong reintroduced the concept of grommet insertion parents have been asking 'may my child swim?', yet there is still no consensus as to the correct answer. This paper reviews the work that has been done on this subject in the last 25 years. A review of the rates of otorrhoea following grommet insertion, irrespective of swimming, shows a variation from 12 to 64 per cent. Evidence suggests that pressures of 12-23 cm H2O are needed to push water through a grommet and that it is unlikely that water will enter the middle ear during surface swimming. Only bath water seems to cause significant inflammatory changes to middle ear mucosa. Not a single paper comparing swimmers with non-swimmers shows an increased rate of otorrhoea in those patients who swam; to the contrary, rates of otorrhoea were repeatedly higher in those patients who did not swim. The evidence suggests that swimming without ear protection can be safely permitted for children with grommets.

AB  - THE PROBLEM. Recoilless weapons commonly release a great deal of energy rearward in the immediate vicinity of the crew. If such weapons are fired from within structures, there is concern that in addition to the acoustic hazard to the ear or other organs, there might be hazard associated with flying debris or even structural collapse. STUDIES. Two studies were conducted to evaluate such hazards by remotely firing a total of 24 rounds from the 90 mm recoilless rifle, LAW, TOW, and DRAGON weapons systems from within enclosures (Price, 1978; Shank & Garinther, 1975). The structures, selected from available buildings, were made of various materials (reinforced concrete, masonry, sandbags, and wood) and ranged in volume from 14m3 to 161 m3 with venting areas from 2.9 m2 to 11 m2. Data included pressure histories, motion pictures of the structures and small objects placed in the room, and physiological data from 32 goats (tissue/organ system damage) and 8 cats (hearing loss measures). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. At the firer's locations, peak pressures ranged from 178 to 189 dB and B-durations ranged from 28 to 376 msec. Although the firings commonly produced some structural damage, none of the firings caused structural collapse or induced tissue damage to nonauditory organs. Ear drum rupture did occur in 5 goats and the cat ears exposed with no hearing protection did show permanent hearing losses. Of the cat ears exposed with hearing protection (EAR plugs), only one showed a permanent loss.

AB  - Today the noise situation at the ramp is mainly determined by the auxilliary power (APU) unit of modern aircraft. In the first order aircraft loaders are affected due to the fact that they are staying at the aircraft during the entire ground time. Full-shift noise-dose measurements showed energy equivalent sound levels of 84 to 92 dB(A) for nine members of this group with a focal point above 90 dB(A). Other ramp personnel are less exposed; the L(eq) did not exceed 84 dB(A) (four cases). The characteristic exposure was assessed in relation to the four types of aircraft involved in more than 80% of all aircraft movements. Duration and calculated mean sound-level of the complete ground time in the order of their frequencies amounted to 42 min and 96 dB(A) for the B-727 and B-737, 34 min and 94 dB(A) for the DC-9, 25 min and 88 dB(A) for the BAC-1-11. Extremely high sound levels were observed with B-737 taxiing towards their ramp position. The aircraft loaders in particular should wear hearing protection when staying on the ramp - cotton ear-plugs are certainly sufficient. None of the examined aircraft types met the ICAO guidelines, for APUs. Future generations will be constructed in accordance to these guidelines and therefore will alleviate the noise situation - yet somewhat aged and noisy aircraft will stay in service still for some time.

AB  - The authors have carried out over 20,000 noise analyses at places of work in factories for mechanical data processing. The data content covers the entire industrial noise range in Hungary and provides leads on ways of assessing the noise situation in factories. This is the point of departure for determining the rate of hearing damage by noise to be expected, which determines the degree of endangerment at the place of work in question. Persons that are to be given audiological examinations are selected and the optimum time for carrying out such examinations for preventive purposes is based on the knowledge of the degree of endangerment. A hearing protection program can be organized and controlled at the national level with the aid of a computer on the basis of the data mentioned.

AB  - Purpose: When navigating with vision, humans can determine their location by visually perceiving their distance and bearing relative to a landmark at a known location. When navigating without vision, positional uncertainty tends to increase with walked distance; if one believes a landmark is very nearby, however, one might disregard any uncertainty accumulated up to that point. If this happens, it should increase response precision in path integration tasks. This study tested that prediction. Method(s): Part 1: 36 participants binocularly viewed a single target cone at 2, 4.2, or 6.2 m in a well-lit room and attempted to walk to it without vision (5 repetitions per target). Part 2: using the same method, 12 participants walked 5 times to a previewed target at 6.2 m; 24 others saw a "landmark" cone on the path at 4.2 m in addition to the 6.2 m target. 12 of these participants received auditory feedback about the landmark location as they passed (via pulsed noise bursts), while the rest saw both the landmark and target cones but received no feedback while passing the landmark. All participants wore hearing protectors to minimize uncontrolled auditory cues. Result(s): Response precision in Part 1, as measured by within-subject standard deviations (SD's), averaged 9.2% of the target distance for all 3 groups. Precision for the no-landmark group was unchanged in Part 2, while SDs for the 2 landmark groups dropped by nearly half to 4.7% of the target distance and did not differ between these 2 groups. All groups overwalked slightly (averaging +15 and +36 cm in Parts 1 and 2, respectively), with no group differences. Conclusion(s): When approaching the remembered location of a previewed landmark, blindfolded navigators behave as if their positional estimate has become more precise, even in the absence of environmental location cues. Apparently, remembered landmarks can reduce some of the positional uncertainty that accumulates when navigating by path integration.

AB  - The noise exposure of refuse removal personnel has been determined with sound level measurements including dosimeter techniques. The mean rating-levels correspond for both techniques, they give equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels L(Al,8h) (time weighting 'Impulse') between 90 and 96 dB(A) and L(Aeq,8h) (time weighting 'Fast') between 82 and 88 dB(A). The noise exposure is mainly caused by the lifting device of the refuse collectors; the possible measures of noise abatement are summarized. The risk of hearing damage has been evaluated using ISO 1999 and compared to the small number of compensated cases of noise induced hearing loss for this profession. In consequence of the deterioration of the directional hearing the use of hearing protectors cannot be recommended, the exception from the precept of wearing hearing protectors according to paragraph 4(2) accident prevention regulation 'Noise' will be established. Since hearing protectors cannot be prescribed occupational medical prevention is of increased importance. Alternative occupations without harmful noise exposure for endangered refuse removal personnel are listed.

AB  - Observations on long serving soldiers who are frequently exposed to impulse noise trauma show that, in spite of ear protection, continued strain may gradually lead from a TTS to a PTS. On the other hand it is obvious that, despite increasing TTS and increasing duration of recovery, recovery is still possible even after several months. The experience that hearing damage caused by a single acoustic trauma tends to improve during the ensuing period or to remain constant, obviously applies also to hearing damage developing gradually due to multiple insults caused by impulse noises (blast noises). Due to today's compulsory wearing of ear protectors, the percentage of endangered persons has fallen to about 5%. But even these subjects have a chance to recover after several months, if the subject's exposure ceases. This is of importance with regard to a survey particularly in the evaluation of occupational disability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the new American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH(new)) noise criteria, as compared to the current U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) hearing conservation criteria, on the number of employees to be included in the hearing conservation program at one industrial facility. This study also compares the combined effects of a 3-dB versus a 5-dB exchange rate ard an 80-dBA versus a 90-dBA measurement threshold on daily noise doses and equivalent 8-hr time-weighted averages (TWAs). Employee noise exposures were measured using paired Ametek MK-3 noise dosimeters, one dosimeter set to the ACGIH(new) noise criteria and one to the present OSHA hearing conservation criteria. Samples were collected over 4-hr periods (half-shifts) for 50 employees in 7 job categories. Results indicate that the majority of the employees' exposures fell below an 8-hr TWA(OSHA) of 85 dBA. The differences between the predicted TWA(ACGIHnew) and the TWA(OSHA) ranged between 0.2 and 12.6 dB for paired samples, with an average difference of 4.6 dB. Overall, these differences in employee 8-hr TWAs would project a 36% increase in the percent of the population enrolled in the hearing conservation program and a 50% increase in the percent of the population required to wear hearing protection.

AB  - The digital high-speed sampling technique was applied to simultaneous measurements of exposure to noise and vibration among workers who used hand-held power tools in a shipyard. The transducers were two accelerometers and two microphones which measured the transmission of vibration acceleration from the handle of the tool to the wrist and the attenuation of noise by the earmuffs. The measurements were taken by a microcomputer-controlled digital multichannel sampling unit. An analogue-digital converter was used with a 100-kHz scanner for multichannel signal acquisition in the 10 kHz bandwidth. The sound pressure was A-weighted, and the vibration acceleration was both unweighted and weighted according to the guidelines of the International Organization for Standardization. Impulsiveness was determined as the difference between the peak and root-mean-square levels. The noise exposure was 81 dB during grinding and 85 dB during hammering. The earmuffs provided protection against impulse noise at least when the impulses contained high frequencies. The transmission loss of vibration acceleration between the tool handle and wrist was 45 dB for grinding and 29 dB for hammering. The transmission of noise and vibration was affected by the frequency content and impulsiveness of the signals.

AB  - The effect of shooting impulses on hearing was analysed in 150 professional forest workers exposed to noise from chain saws. The exposure to shooting impulses (L(esi)) was designed to take into account the peak levels of shooting impulses, their number and use of hearing protectors. Hearing loss was dependent on L(esi) even after allowing for the age of subjects and their exposure to chain saw noise. Hearing threshold levels were compared between pairwise matched groups with high and low L(esi). Proper matching was achieved for age, chain saw noise, salicylate consumption, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking and vibration-induced white finger symptoms. The workers with high L(esi) had 9 dB greater hearing loss at 4 kHz and 10 dB greater hearing loss at 8 kHz than those with low L(esi), the difference being significant at P < 0.05 level. In evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss the exposure to shooting impulses from different calibre weapons should be determined since they increase the extent of hearing loss. The present study describes the L(esi) method which more accurately evaluates the harmful effects of shooting noise impulses on hearing.

AB  - The effectiveness of ten different ear-protectors (6 types of earmuffs and 4 types of earplugs) has been tested under laboratory conditions and in the real occupational environment. Three methods were used: (1) physical, utilizing a dummy head; (2) subjective, real-ear, executed on trained human subjects; (3) subjective, measuring TTS2 resulting from occuptional one-workday exposure. It could be shown that the ear protection efficiency ascertained on the basis of TTS2 measurements on workers exposed to noise in their occupational environment is, in nearly all cases, smaller than the efficiency expected, taking into account the sound damping of the same protectors, tested under laboratory conditions, using the physical or real-ear method. Measurements of TTS2 were found to give the best data needed to define the protectors' efficiency, since they include, simultaneously, the impact of various environmental factors, the subjective reactiveness, the nature of the professional task and the acoustical features of the protector used. Therefore this method enables the estimation of the real protection given to workers with a risk of noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Peak pressure has been one of the key parameters of impulse noise used to assess the hazard to hearing. It is used in most international noise exposure limits. France uses an A-weighted energy limit. There is a rough correspondence between peak pressure and the hazard to hearing for a given type of impulse noise. However, when the effects of different types of impulses are compared, this correspondence breaks down. One of the alternate measures of impulse intensity is weighted energy. Weighted energy is appealing for a number of reasons. It does not depend on details of the pressure-time history such as the peak pressure and the more common duration measures. It should be easier to integrate with continuous or intermittent noise standards. It would make it easier to use standard hearing protector attenuation to estimate the hazard when a specific hearing protector is worn. Results of previously published articles and reports will be discussed. These reports lead to the conclusion that weighted energy is a more potent determiner of hearing hazard than peak pressure if spectral effects are controlled.

AB  - A theoretically based formative evaluation was conducted with coal miners in the Appalachian Mountains who were at high risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The results of four focus groups indicate that despite high levels of knowledge, strong perceived severity of negative consequences, and strong perceived susceptibility to hearing loss, two main categories of barriers (environmental and individual) keep coal miners from using their hearing protection devices (HPD). Further analysis suggests that the environmental factors, rather than individual variables, more strongly influence decisions against protective actions. Recommendations and practical implications are offered.

AB  - Introduction: Unprotected water exposure as a cause of otorrhea in patients with tympanostomy tubes remains controversial. Although most otolaryngologists continue to recommend either the avoidance of swimming or the use of water precautions during swimming, evidence indicates that the infection rate may not be affected by this practice. This study prospectively evaluates the possible role of unprotected water exposure in the occurrence of post-tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred twelve consecutive patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement were randomized into swimming and nonswimming groups. No special precautions (eg, ear plugs, canal occlusion, antibiotic drugs) were used in either group. This incidence of otorrhea was then compared between these groups. Result(s): One-year follow- up was obtained in 107 patients. There was no significant difference in the incidence of otorrhea or the number of otorrhea episodes between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Swimming is not contraindicated in patients with tympanostomy tubes, and water precautions do not decrease the incidence of otorrhea. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.

AB  - A field study assessed the actual spectral noise attenuation achieved by 40 industrial workers wearing four different hearing protection devices (HPDs) while on the job. The effect of two different HPD fitting procedures (subject fit vs. trained fit) on attenuation performance over two three-week periods of protector use was determined. Subjects were retrieved from their workplaces without prior knowledge of when they were to be tested and were not permitted to readjust the fit of their HPDs. Attenuation data were then collected using psychophysical procedures testing real ear attenuation at threshold. Statistical analyses indicated that the earplugs' attenuation significantly improved when training for proper fitting was used, whereas the earmuff and the ear canal cap were relatively insensitive to the training effect. The training was most effective for a slow-recovery foam plug over the three-week period. Results confirmed that laboratory protocols designed to simulate workplace influences on attenuation may not be relied on to yield reasonable estimates of field protection performance of HPDs, particularly for earplugs; however, the laboratory results were much better predictors of field protection for the earmuff. This study also demonstrated that the labeled manufacturers' noise reduction ratings (NRRs) substantially overestimated the actual field attenuation performance.

AB  - A study was conducted to assess the noise levels of popular Karaoke environments in Korea and the degree of potential noise-induced hearing loss due to commercial Karaoke noise. Using 18 subjects with normal hearing, a two-way, mixed-factors experimental design was used with two independent variables of "noise source" (no-singer, one-singer, and two-singer conditions) and "music type" (Trot, Ballad, and Rock music). For each experimental condition, average sound pressure levels and maximum sound pressure levels were measured. For assessing amount of temporary hearing threshold shift as a measure of potential hearing loss index, pure-tone audiometry was applied for measuring subjects' hearing threshold levels of both ears before and after 100min exposure to Karaoke noise. Questionnaires from 155 actual Karaoke users were also obtained to evaluate realistic user subjective perception on the Karaoke environment. Results showed that noise levels of typical Karaoke singing environments were higher than 95dBA, with maximum noise levels often exceeded the US OSHA's non-permissible 115dBA level. Further statistical analysis of hearing threshold shift revealed that up to 8dB of significant hearing loss was found at the most important human hearing frequency band, centered at 4000Hz, after about less than 2h of Karaoke noise exposure, indicating that Karaoke facilities may pose a serious threat to noise-induced hearing loss. Along with some ergonomic/safety issues, practical hearing protection strategies are suggested and discussed. Relevance to industry Since noise levels from popular commercial Karaoke facilities are found to be potentially dangerous, the Karaoke-related industries, of supporting a big consumer market of entertainment, need to provide safer environments to protect naive users from potential hearing loss. Providing better design of Karaoke facilities with some ergonomic intervention strategies (such as proper sound absorptive treatment in Karaoke rooms, displaying warning signs of potential hearing loss, and setting up an upper safety volume limit in the Karaoke machine, etc.) may help those industries not only contribute for consumer protection but also develop better market with strong ethical and legal support in the future. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The present investigation was carried out with the aim of ascertaining whether exposure to dangerous noise might act as a stress factor, which, on account of its own nature, is capable of provoking an increase in catecholamine excretion. Experiments were carried out on some Air Force specialists, daily exposed to loud noise, but completely protected against untoward effects of the auditory apparatus by ear plugs. The subjects were grouped in two lots, exposed to different noise conditions, the former exposed to continuous and constant noise (120 db for one and a half hours), the latter exposed to intermittent noise (80-120 db for 5 hours, with intervals of about 20 min between the highest peaks, the duration of each one of these being a few seconds). Individual tolerance was satisfactory, and after the end of the exposure no disturbances or fatigue symptoms could be demonstrated.

AB  - Objective: The effect of level-dependent hearing protection devices (HPDs) on subjects' ability to identify real-life environmental sounds was investigated. Design(s): Eighteen subjects with no hunting experience attempted to identify sounds (crow, duck, turkey, deer, owl, goose, and person) recorded at various distances in the presence of the SoundScope and Sonic II level-dependent HPDs as well as in an open ear condition. Knowles Electronic's Manikin for Auditory Research was employed in making the experimental recordings. The Sonic II accomplishes level-dependent attenuation via a passive mechanism, whereas the SoundScope employs active circuitry that attenuates loud sounds while providing a small amount of high frequency amplification for soft sounds. Both devices are commercially available and are advertised for hunters/shooters. Sound identification scores (SISs) were determined for each condition. Result(s): Mean SISs differed significantly among the three earplug conditions, collapsed over type of sound and distance, with the best SIS obtained under the open ear condition (96.43%) and the worst under the Sonic II condition (84.13%). Further analysis revealed that the listening conditions differed significantly only at the 100 yard distance. Conclusion(s): Auditory awareness was not maintained by either device investigated during the 100 yard condition. However, auditory awareness was maintained by both devices at a distance of 75 yards or closer. These devices may be appropriate for use in certain hunting/shooting situations depending on several factors including type of game being bunted, environment, and shooting range of the weapon. Further support also is provided for the usage of level-dependent HPDs during recreational shooting activities (i.e., at a shooting range).

AB  - The ability of earmuffs and helmets to reduce low-frequency (4-250 Hz) noise was tested in an anechoic chamber, in a paint factory, outside and in a low-frequency noise chamber. Prototypes of a new noise helmet were also tested. Steady noise and low-frequency noise impulses were used as the sound sources. The testing was sometimes difficult because physiological noise raised the sound level inside the hearing protector at some frequencies after the protector was put on. Therefore the low-frequency sound level had to be over 100 dB at frequencies of 2-250 Hz during the tests. The earmuffs attenuated noise levels of 1-20 dB in the 4-250 Hz frequency range. Commercial noise helmets tested were not as good as earmuffs in attenuating low-frequency noise. New noise helmet prototypes attenuated low-frequency noise better than did earmuffs or commercial helmets (attenuation 5-39 dB).

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety of tractors and tractor trailers in road traffic. The inspection was based on Finnish government regulations concerning road traffic and occupational safety. The data were collected in March and September of 1973. Altogether 600 tractors were inspected. The tractors were an average of 4.4 yr old. The newest tractors were found in the counties of North Karelia and Hame, and the oldest, in the county of Middle Finland. The lights of every fourth tractor did not function properly, and the direction signals worked on 80% of all tractors. Visibility from the cabin was prevented by faulty windshield wipers in 23% of the tractors, by a dirty windshield in 35%, and by broken or improperly aimed rearview mirrors in 23%. The brakes were in poor condition in 17% of the tractors, and the brake pedals were disconnected in 42%. The protectors of the power take-off were in place on every fourth tractor only. Almost 50% of the tractors in road traffic were equipped with a safety cab. The tractor trailers were an average of 4.7 yr old. 64% of the trailers were homemade. 34% were equipped with a drive axle, and the rest were pull-type trailers. The protectors of the transmission were in poor condition. All protectors were in place in only 5 of the 138 drive-type trailers. The direction signals were faulty in 33% of the trailers, and the rear reflectors or lights were faulty in 18%. The rear of the trailers was painted a light color, as the law demands, on every seventh trailer only. The tractors were usually driven by a 25- to 50-yr old person, who was licensed to drive cars for personal use. Every sixth driver was licensed to drive only tractors. 25% of the drivers used ear protectors.

AB  - The hearing of 165 auto assembly workers exposed to noise levels of between 94 and 108 dB was assessed by means of air and bone conductance audiograms obtained during peak and low production periods to determine acute shifts in hearing. Compared to non-industrially exposed and non-production subgroups, the exposed subjects had significantly (P < 0.001) elevated thresholds at both peak and low production periods. There was an acute and significant (P < 0.001) drop in the hearing thresholds of the exposed subjects during low production period. This was especially true of cross-sections of the exposed subjects and of a cohort specifically sampled at both high and low production periods. Hearing thresholds for the exposed subjects increased with both age and duration of employment and were significantly correlated with duration of employment (P < 0.05). Of all the confounders (age, duration of employment, residential density) assessed by stepwise multiple regression analysis, duration of employment was the only significant contributor to the threshold shift. There was no conductive deafness among the study subjects. There was no consistent association between blood pressure and either hearing threshold or noise level. The results indicate good prospects for hearing conservation for Nigeria workers if hearing protection and noise abatement programs, currently not mandated by statutes, can be instituted.

While theoretically, engineering measures should form the first line of control in industrial noise problems, for various reasons, in many work situations this is not possible and ear protection is often the only practical answer. In this respect, the importance of health education cannot be over-emphasized. In Singapore, an estimated 20,000 workers from about 400 factories in various industries are exposed to a noise hazard. Since May 1976, a nationwide Hearing Conservation Programme was launched with the corporate support of government, management and labour. The central part of the Programme is mass audiometric screening using a mobile van equipped with twin booth facilities. This voluntary scheme is subsidised and the objective is to stimulate awareness and concern over the problem of industrial noise and noise induced deafness so that in the long term, individual factories would take over and continue their own Hearing Conservation Programme. Some results from the examination are discussed, including the progress made during the first two years of the Programme.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that insert-type hearing protectors may provide significantly less noise attenuation as they are used in the workplace than that measured in the laboratory. Many factors that include proper fitting and insertion practices, and the overall education and motivation provided by the employer are directly related to the success of a hearing conservation program. Under ideal conditions where the proper education and motivation are provided, and where insert-type protectors are properly fitted, the wearer may still have difficulty inserting the protectors properly because of such factors as lack of dexterity or size of fingers. This insertion problem is evident in laboratory measurements and is even more of a problem in the workplace when direct attention is not focused on the insertion process and time for insertion may be short. The need for an effective insertion device is evident. An insertion and seating device for two types of preformed earplugs has been under study in the US Army Medical Department. Laboratory data have shown increased noise attenuation when this device is used and field testing has indicated numerous advantages over other techniques for inserting and seating earplugs.

AB  - Objective: To assess the relation between recreational firearm use and high-frequency hearing loss in a population of older adults. Design(s): Cross-sectional, population-based cohort study. Setting(s): The midwestern community of Beaver Dam, Wis. Participant(s): A population-based sample of 3753 participants (83% of those eligible), aged 48 to 92 years, participated in the baseline phase of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Lifetime and past year self-reported firearm use during target shooting and hunting were assessed by interview. Hearing thresholds were measured by pure-tone audiometry. Result(s): After age and other factors were adjusted for, men (n = 1538) who had ever regularly engaged in target shooting (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.19) or who had done so in the past year (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.46) were more likely to have a marked high-frequency hearing loss than those who had not. Risk of having a marked high-frequency hearing loss increased 7% for every 5 years the men had hunted (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.12). Thirty-eight percent of the target shooters and 95% of the hunters reported never wearing hearing protection while shooting in the past year. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that use of recreational firearms is associated with marked high-frequency hearing loss in men. There is a need for further education of users of recreational firearms regarding the risk of hearing impairment associated with firearm use and the availability and importance of appropriate hearing protection.

AB  - The purpose of the present work is to illustrate the dose-response relationship for the effects of noise on hearing within the shipbuilding industry. Special problems are involved in retrospective studies of this kind, due mainly to the difficulty of determining each person's total noise dose. In evaluating the results, therefore, the authors have concentrated on the question whether the noise at a shipyard is less or more harmful than continuous noise of the same equivalent level. Result(s): Registering of the noise exposure with microphone and tape recorder and subsequent analysis at the laboratory gave an accurate description of the exposure. It shows that about 2,500 impulses with peak levels between 110 and 135 dB occur daily and that these impulses are superimposed on a high, fluctuating background level. The results from individual noise dosimetry show that the daily or weekly noise dose follows the rhythm of the production and is also a function of the employee's occupation. As an arithmetic average the measured equivalent level for the near field was found to be 94 dB(A) and 88 dB(A) for the reverberant field. Despite the fact that hearing protectors were worn in most cases, the hearing measurements demonstrated that noise-induced hearing losses were common. The pure tone audiogram showed the typical noise dip. Only 41.9% of the 1492 employees examined have normal hearing, while 58.1% have some type of hearing impairment. 20.4% of the employees have severe NIHL. A comparison between the hearing-damage hazard when exposed to continuous noise according to ISO R 1999 and the risk when exposed to shipyard noise indicates that shipyard noise is definitely more harmful to hearing than is continuous noise.

AB  - Hypothesis: Unilateral conductive hearing loss (HL) causes measurable disability in realistic hearing environments. The benefits of improving this loss depend both on the absolute level of final hearing and on hearing asymmetry. Background(s): Surgical success is often measured by the degree of change in the air-bone gap or in the air thresholds. The Glasgow Benefit Plot and the Belfast Rule of Thumb suggest that a given hearing gain will be of greater benefit if the postoperative thresholds in the worse ear are a <30-dB HL or within 15 dB of the contralateral ear. This assertion has important surgical implications, but few audiometric data supporting it currently exist. Method(s): Speech-in-noise sound-field scores were measured in 16 normal volunteers at three presentation levels at two signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Two levels of unilateral conductive HL were simulated with earplugs, averaging 25- and 43-dB HL, respectively, and the effect on speech-in-noise scores was measured and analyzed. Result(s): Unilateral conductive HL is a disadvantage at lower sound intensities and low SNRs, but it can be compensated for by increasing volume or SNR. The benefits of improving unilateral conductive HL are greater if the final asymmetry is <25 dB and the final hearing threshold is <25 dB. Conclusion(s): Unilateral conductive HL is a significant disadvantage at low SNRs or presentation volumes. The benefits of surgery to improve HL depend not only on the degree of hearing improvement but also on the final hearing threshold in both ears.

AB  - In a cross-sectional survey, 1674 pupils in the age of 10 to 20 years were asked about their music hearing habits as well as for their personal acceptance of limiting the sound level in discotheques to 95 dB (A). For that purpose, the pupils had to fill in questionnaire before and a second questionnaire after a teaching unit on the subject "hearing damages caused by loud music". With these questionnaires it was examined to what extent the transfer of knowledge concerning that topic causes a change in awareness and behaviour with adolescents. After 5 to 6 weeks, a third questionnaire was carried on examining the long-term effect of the measurement. While only 18.4% of the pupils would accept level limits beforehand, the part increased up to 34% after the teaching unit was performed. After the project, the half of the asked adolescents indicated to prefer a level limited discotheque in comparison to others. The part of the proponents of level limited discos increased by 13 with the knowledge of possible dangers. Only for 20% of the adolescents the high volume of the music is a primary criterion of choosing a disco. Approx. 50% of all adolescents do not care about possible level limits in discos. Other criteria, such as atmosphere, music style, meeting friends and entrance prices play a bigger role. Recent studies show, that a lowering of the music sound level down to about 95 dB(A) would not influence negatively the acceptance and the visitors habits. Concerning that topic, the knowledge of the pupils is insufficient. Only 8.7% of the adolescents were comprehensively informed about possible dangers caused by too loud music consumption. 73% were inspired to contemplate about their leisure time habits by the project. The occurred changes of awareness showed a significant long-term effect 6 weeks later, in fact. 42% of the pupils indicated to deal more carefully with temporary hearing-losses and indefinable ear noises since the teaching lesson. The use of ear protectors at loud music events finds virtually no acceptance with adolescents. More than 85% of the asked pointed out that they have never taken such protective meosures yet. Only 1,4% of the participants indicated a continuous or frequent use.

AB  - Tests on temporary displacement of the hearing threshold are used as model situations for studies on permanent loss of hearing. Temporary displacement of the hearing threshold by means of sounds of high intensity of more than 90 dB is several times as big as that caused by low intensities. This displacement is proportional to the duration of the exposure. Its decrease lasts ten times as long as the sound having provoked the displacement. The temporary displacement of the hearing threshold following alternating periods of noise and quiet represents only half of the displacement caused by a continuous noise of the same acoustical energy. A continuous noise may not reach threshold of 90 dB(A). An interrupted noise has to be evaluated by means of the equivalent noise level L(eq) and may not reach the value L(eq) of 90 dB(A). The risk of deafness caused by excessive noise can be evaluated by means of L(eq) and the duration of exposure in years. If a situation reaches or surpasses the limit, protection measures have to be taken. With the help of technical measures, noise can be reduced at the source as well as in its spreading. Organisational measures can shorten the duration of exposure. Finally, individual hearing protection apparatuses offer a preventive measure, but in no case can they replace the other means of protection.

AB  - The United States Navy has had instructions dealing specifically with hearing conservation for 18 years. With this knowledge, one would expect that any single Naval installation should now have a well established and effective program to prevent occupational hearing loss in all employees. It is disappointing that the Naval shipyard discussed in this presentation has shown a concerted effort to meet the challenges of hearing conservation only during the past 2 years. A few deficiencies still exist. The most bothersome problem areas, at present, are the lack of stress on engineering control of noise, poor enforcement of hearing protector use, and the uncertainty of getting annual monitoring audiograms on all employees exposed to hazardous noise. Several items in the Hearing Conservation Program have been brought to acceptable levels in the past 2 years. These include posting of noise hazard signs, education of employees and medical personnel, audiometric testing, appropriate interpretation of each audiogram, proper disposition of affected employees, and adequate physician involvement in the overall program. Noise measurement has been the only aspect of this shipyard's Hearing Conservation Program which has been performed in a consistently adequate manner. This shipyard now possesses all of the basic tools for having an effective, functioning Hearing Conservation Program. However, the success of this shipyard's Hearing Conservation Program challenge is dependent on the proper and continued motivation of both the management and the work force.

AB  - This study examined the effect of ear canal occlusion and masking noise on four parameters of voice: (1) average fundamental frequency, (2) intensity in decibel (dB), (3) maximum fundamental frequency observed in a given sample (max), and (4) minimum fundamental frequency observed in a given sample (min). 12 normal hearing undergraduates produced the vowel /i/ ten times under conditions of unoccluded ear canal, ear canal occluded with a sound attenuating earplug, or masking noise. Other than a small (.73 dB) decrease in intensity, analysis showed no significant changes under the occluded condition; however, the masking condition showed statistically significant increases in the fundamental frequency, the intensity, and the maximum and minimum frequency as well as an increased range of frequencies.

AB  - Objective: The performance of four insert earplugs was evaluated by determining the Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) and the Subject-Fit Noise Reduction Rating [NRR(SF)]. The NRR and NRR(SF) were calculated from real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) data collected using the experimenter-fit protocol described in the now-rescinded ANSI S3.19-1974 (American National Standards Institute, 1974) and the subject-fit protocol of the recently revised ANSI S12.6-1997 (American National Standards Institute, 1997) standards for REAT measurement. Design(s): A comparison of the experimenter-fit and subject-fit REAT performance was conducted using four pools of subjects, one pool per protector. Each device was tested with at least 20 subjects, the minimum size necessary to estimate the NRR(SF) for an earplug. The REAT was measured with third-octave narrowband noise stimuli for center frequencies at 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3.15, 4, 6.3, and 8 kHz. The REAT means and standard deviations were compared with the manufacturer data. Result(s): This study showed that the NRR(SF) is typically lower than the NRR and that the NRR(SF) is not well-predicted by the NRR derating schemes recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Conclusion(s): The difference between the present NRR on hearing protector labels and the NRR(SF) is sufficiently large and unpredictable enough to render the application of derating schemes meaningless even though these schemes attempt to account for the difference between the laboratory and real-world outcomes. The only way to provide a protector noise rating that is predictive of a real-world outcome is to retest the protector according to the subject-fit method of ANSI S12.6-1997 (American National Standards Institute, 1997).

AB  - Current hearing protector rating standards estimate the protection performance for a given frequency as the mean attenuation minus a multiple of the standard deviation. Distributions of real-ear attenuation at threshold data are fit with maximum likelihood estimation procedures using both normal and mixed-normal models. Attenuations from six hearing protectors, Bilsom UF-1 earmuff, Bilsom Quietzone, E*A*R Classic, E*A*R EXPRESS Pod Plugs, Howard Leight MAX, and Wilson EP100 earplugs, measured with a subject-fit protocol are reported. The mixed-normal (bimodal) model provides a better fit to the empirical data than the unimodal model for most frequencies and protectors. Primarily, the bimodal model fits the shape of the distributions caused by data from poorly-fit protectors. This paper presents an alternative method for estimating the protection performance either with the more accurate bimodal model or directly from the empirical cumulative distributions of the attenuation data.

AB  - Personal heat strain monitoring provides the best means for maximizing worker safety and productivity in hot jobs. The present study compared methods for reducing the environmental effect on aural canal temperature in an attempt to reduce the predictive error of a personal heat stress monitor (QST) and a simple ear thermistor (EAR). Subjects underwent three exposures in impermeable protective clothing (PC) in an environment of 30.1degreeC wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) wearing either ear plugs (PLG), ear moulds (MLD) or ear moulds and earmuffs (MFS). Mean work time across all trials was 63.1 +/- 7.9 min, with a mean rectal temperature at 60 min of 38.5 +/- 0.1degreeC and a sweat production rate of 29.7 +/- 8.6 g/min. Rectal temperature was used as the criterion measure of core temperature. Although group mean predictions were satisfactory, large SD of mean differences (+/-0.36) meant that predictive ability of QST for individuals was greatly impaired. A simple well-insulated ear thermistor showed slightly better accuracy (+/-0.28) as a predictor of rectal temperature across time, particularly at peak temperatures. Incorporating the predictive error of aural temperature still extended the duration of safe work times relative to ACGIH guidelines. Further investigation is still necessary to ensure that predictions based on aural temperature are accurate and safe for the worker population across varying conditions.

The people examined work in a factory at which there is not very much grime. They were exposed to wideband permanent noise with a sound pressure level of 94 dB(AI). The working people wore the cotton at all times and in accordance with the instructions for use. It was proved that the noise acting on the ear could be reduced by 13 +/- 5 dB(AI) by wearing the cotton wool ear plugs from Lauscha.

AB  - Background: Military aviator helmet communications systems are designed to enhance speech intelligibility (SI) in background noise and reduce exposure to harmful levels of noise. Some aviators, over the course of their aviation career, develop noise-induced hearing loss that may affect their ability to perform required tasks. New technology can improve SI in noise for aviators with normal hearing as well as those with hearing loss. Method(s): SI in noise scores were obtained from 40 rotary-wing aviators (20 with normal hearing and 20 with hearing-loss waivers). There were three communications systems evaluated: a standard SPH-4B, an SPH-4B aviator helmet modified with communications earplug (CEP), and an SPH-4B modified with active noise reduction (ANR). Result(s): Subjects' SI was better in noise with newer technologies than with the standard issue aviator helmet. A significant number of aviators on waivers for hearing loss performed within the range of their normal hearing counterparts when wearing the newer technology. The rank order of perceived speech clarity was 1) CEP, 2) ANR, and 3) unmodified SPH-4B. Conclusion(s): To insure optimum SI in noise for rotary-wing aviators, consideration should be given to retrofitting existing aviator helmets with new technology, and incorporating such advances in communication systems of the future. Review of standards for determining fitness to fly is needed.

AB  - Aim: The present study aimed at investigating health complaints and audiological findings of 2 groups of workers. Study design: Clinical prospective randomized. Material(s) and Method(s): Group 1 was exposed to high sound pressure levels and vibration transmitted by hands and arms through the use of power grazers. Group 2 was exposed to high sound pressure levels and whole-body vibration transmitted by heavy machinery such as paving rollers, skid-steer loaders, backhoes and compact hydraulic excavators. The 73 participants underwent interview, otoscopy, and pure-tone audiometry. Regarding general health, workers in group 2, exposed to whole-body vibration presented the highest number of complaints. Result(s): All the participants from group 1 used hearing protective equipment and 11% of them complained of tinnitus. Not all workers from group 2 used hearing protectors and of 17% of them, 2 reported tinnitus. However, group 1 workers, exposed to hand-arm vibration, comprised the group with the highest percentage of abnormal audiograms. Conclusion(s): This study revealed a series of weaknesses in the health surveillance of these populations and indicated the need for the implementation of preventive programs focusing on their exposure to noise and vibration.

AB  - Glowing welding particles can cause severe burns of unprotected ears. Seven cases are discussed, 6 with middle ear damage and troublesome, protracted infections. Facial palsy occurred in 1 patient and the chorda tympani was damaged in another. Tympanoplasty was performed in 4 of the patients, but successfully in only one case. Two patients are waiting for operation because of persistent ear infection. These facts indicate reduced healing tendency in middle ears damaged by welding particles. Wearing ear plugs or ear muffs against noise will also protect the ears against welding particles.

AB  - A case-control study of the risk of injuries incurred by male shipyard workers in Den Helder, The Netherlands, was carried out in 1986-1987. The main focus of interest was factors which can interfere with faculties needed for recognizing warning signals of imminent danger. Three hundred workers who had had at least one injury in the previous 3 1/2 years and 300 matched controls were asked about their current use of alcohol, tranquilizers, and cigarettes; the wearing of spectacles and earplugs; taking a nap at noon; engaging in sports during leisure hours; and involvement in a traffic accident during the past year. The hearing acuity of most of the workers involved in the study, as well as the noise load at work, had been recently assessed. Alcohol consumption, hearing loss greater than 20 dB, and loud noise greater than 82 dB(A) were found to be safety hazards. At this shipyard, the risks attributable to noise and hearing loss together accounted for 43% of the injuries.

AB  - From the viewpoint of elucidating the etiological mechanism of vibration-induced white finger (VWF), a model experiment was designed using a chain-saw under laboratory conditions. Finger skin temperature and finger blood flow were measured simultaneously as indicators of peripheral circulatory movement, using a thermister and an apparatus for measuring tissue blood flow based on the thermal diffusion method. In the first project (Experiment A), five healthy subjects operated a chain-saw at a high working speed with-out actually cutting anything. In the second project (Experiment B), seven healthy subjects were exposed to three different kinds of experiments with combinations of hand-arm vibration, noise and tool weight at about 15 degrees C room temperature. In the third project (Experiment C), the effects of tool weight and grip force were examined. In the fourth project (Experiment D), patients suffering from vibration disease were exposed to hand-arm vibration and the noise of a chain-saw for 2 minutes. In experiment A, the mean value of the normalized finger skin temperature decreased gradually with cyclic changes corresponding to each exposure and break period. Changes in finger blood flow had almost the same pattern as the changes of skin temperature, but the recovery of blood flow during a 30 sec break period was notable and a slight elevation of the base line was observed. In experiment B, the mean value for the normalized finger skin temperature decreased much more when the subjects operated a chain-saw at a high working speed than when they operated the chain-saw with the noise isolated by double hearing protection. On the other hand, the results obtained in experiment C indicated that the effect of tool weight should be considered as an important factor for investigating the acute changes in peripheral circulation. In experiment D, some patients showed an unusual pattern in the change of blood flow during a post exposure period which was not seen in healthy subjects.

AB  - This experimental study was designed to determine whether a combination of noise and vibration produced more pronounced changes in temporary shifts of finger skin temperature and temporary threshold shift (TTS) of hearing than those resulting from exposure to either stress alone. Nineteen healthy subjects were exposed to six different combinations of vibration, noise, and handle holding by using a chain saw for a pre-determined time. The mean value of normalised finger skin temperature decreased much more when the subjects operated a chain saw at high speed (exposure 1) than when they operated the chain saw with the noise isolated by double hearing protection (exposure 2). In five of the 14 subjects significantly larger TTS values at 4 kHz were observed in the former condition (exposure 1) compared with the values obtained when they stood beside someone else operating a chain saw (exposure 3). The results of this study suggest that noise may play a part in inducing the constriction of the peripheral vessels seen with local exposure to vibration, and that hand-arm vibration may produce an additive effect on the noise induced TTS.

AB  - The program of health promotion in the area of hearing protection (IHPP) is proposed as a part of Operational Target 8 of the National Health Program "Reducing exposure to harmful factors in the living, working and educational environment and mitigating their health effects" and corresponds with the aims of the Strategic Governmental Program on Health Protection and Safety at Work. Both in Poland and in the region of swietokrzyskie there is an urgent need to undertake appropriate steps to protect the hearing organ in the working population against harmful effects present in the work environment. It is estimated that 25% of diagnosed occupational diseases is associated with occupational hearing loss. The program is addressed to workers exposed to noise at work. To achieve the main goal of the program it is necessary: to reduce noise emissions and exposure to noise in the work environment; to promote behavior conducive to hearing protection among workers exposed to noise; to improve the quality of prevention in the occupational health services responsible for hearing protection. The Regional Center of Occupational Medicine in Kielce (coordinator) and primary units of occupational health service are involved in the implementation of the program, whereas, employers, occupational safety and health services, the State Labor Inspectorate and Sanitary Inspectorate participate in its implementation. It is expected that the program in the region of swietokrzyskie will yield the following expected results: the reduction of noise emission to safe levels; the increased awareness of using optimal hearing protectors among noise-exposed workers; the decreased number of workers with diagnosed noise-induced hearing loss, and the decrease in the number of new cases of occupational hearing impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an accurate diagnostic test for detecting abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary system. Because it is noninvasive, MRCP appears to be more tolerable than ERCP, although this has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to compare patient satisfaction after MRCP and ERCP performed sequentially. METHOD(S): We prospectively recruited 34 patients undergoing ERCP, for whom an MRCP was able to be performed before ERCP. Patient satisfaction was assessed by validated questionnaires using seven-point Likhert scales (individual ratings and direct comparisons). The following dimensions were explored: anxiety, pain, discomfort, tolerability (relative to expectations), willingness to repeat the procedure, and overall preference. Chi2 and Student's t tests (paired and unpaired) were performed, and 95% CIs were provided. RESULT(S): Two patients (5.9%) were unable to undergo MRCP because of claustrophobia. The remaining 32 completed both tests (94% same day) and all questionnaires. Average age was 56+/-18 yr, and 66% were women. In 23 patients, some degree of biliary obstruction was suspected; nine patients had pancreatitis. Patients reported a lower degree of pain (p < 0.001) and discomfort (p = 0.047) with MRCP, but MRCP was more difficult than they expected (p = 0.0 12). Patients were marginally more willing to repeat MRCP (ns, p = 0.09). On direct comparisons, patients were more satisfied with MRCP regarding anxiety (p = 0.04) and pain (p = 0.001). Patients displayed a higher overall preference for MRCP compared with ERCP (p = 0.01); however, only 59% clearly preferred MRCP over ERCP. The most common problem with MRCP was claustrophobia or noise (n = 15), and the differences were more striking in the subgroup without this problem. The subgroup undergoing purely diagnostic ERCPs showed clear preferences for MRCP. CONCLUSION(S): In many respects, MRCP is well tolerated, and certain subgroups, especially those undergoing diagnostic ERCPs, prefer MRCP over ERCP. As an endoscopist, one needs to be aware of the limitations of MRCP and relay these to the patient, as it seems that patients find MRCP more difficult than anticipated, and a significant number still prefer ERCP over MRCP. Patient satisfaction may be further improved by reducing noise and claustrophobia with selective premedication, earplugs, and the use of the new quieter fenestrated magnetic resonance imaging scanners.

AB  - OBJECTIVES - This study tested the hypotheses that, in high noise levels [>=85 dB(A)], hearing protection devices are used largely by workers sensitive to noise, as reflected by reports of noise annoyance, and that the usage would reduce distress symptoms. METHODS - Data collected from 1587 healthy male blue-collar workers included noise exposure level, noise annoyance, use of hearing protection devices, distress symptoms (somatic complaints and poststress irritability), and possible confounding by age, education and ethnic origin. RESULTS - Multiple logistic regression results indicated that the use of hearing protection devices was related to noise exposure level [odds ratio (OR) 2.94, 95% confidence interval (95% Cl) 2.58 - 3.30], but more so to high noise annoyance (OR 3.03, 95% Cl 2.77 - 3.29), even after control for age, education, and ethnic origin. No interaction was found between noise level and noise annoyance. These findings highlight the contribution of noise annoyance to the use of hearing protection devices. Of the 42.6% of workers using hearing protection devices in the presence of high ambient noise, 60% were highly annoyed. Noise-annoyed workers also tended to wear hearing protection devices even in low noise levels. The use of hearing protection devices was associated with lower distress symptoms among the low and moderately annoyed workers, but among the highly annoyed workers the reverse was true. CONCLUSIONS - Thus, for the highly annoyed workers, the use of hearing protection devices was perhaps an additional source of stress. One immediate implication of this study is that future intervention procedures should focus on unannoyed workers who tend to use hearing protection devices less.

AB  - The present study examined the usefulness of personal variables: noise annoyance, and components of the protection motivation theory (R. W. Rogers, 1983) along with social-organizational factors in explaining hearing protection device (HPD) use among Israeli manufacturing workers. Participants were 281 men exposed to harmful noise levels for which routine HPD use is required by regulation. In practice, 3 HPD user groups were identified: nonusers (n = 38), occasional users (n = 125), and regular users (n = 118). HPD use was objectively verified. HPD use was primarily related to the personal variables but not to management pressure, coworker pressure, or family support. The most powerful predictors of HPD use were perceived self-efficacy (for long-term HPD use), perceived susceptibility (to hearing loss), and noise annoyance, together explaining 48% of the outcome variance. These findings have implications for interventions aimed at motivating workers to use HPDs regularly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the experience of paramedic personnel at mass gatherings in the absence of on-site physicians. DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients evaluated by paramedics with emergency medical services (EMS) medical control. SETTING: First-aid facility operated by paramedics at an outdoor amphitheater involving 32 (predominantly rock music) concerts in accordance with the Chicago EMS System, June through September 1990. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 438 patients (< or = 0.1% on-site population) were evaluated. INTERVENTIONS: Presentations to the first-aid facility were viewed as if the patient was presenting to an ambulance. Transportation to an emergency department was strongly recommended for all encounters. Time from presentation to the first-aid facility until disposition was limited to 30 minutes in the absence of on-line [direct] medical control. Refusal of care was accepted. On-line [direct] medical control with the EMS resource hospital was initiated as needed. Off-line [indirect] medical control consisted of weekly reviews of all patients records and periodic site visits. RESULT(S): Of the 438 patients, 366 (84%) refused further care, including 31 patients (7%) who refused advanced life support (ALS) level care. Seventy-two patients (16%) were transported; 37 by ALS and 35 by basic life support (BLS) units. On-line [direct] medical control was initiated in all ALS patients that were transported as well as for those who refused care. No known deaths or adverse outcomes occurred, based on lack of inquiries or complaints from the local EMS system, emergency departments receiving transported patients, law enforcement agencies, 9-1-1 emergency response providers, venue management, or security. No request for medical records from law firms have occurred. Problems noted initially were poor documentation and a tendency not to document all encounters (e.g., dispensing band-aids, tampons, earplugs, etc.). Concerns noted included: initial and subsequent vital signs, times of arrival, interventions, dispositions, and patient conditions of refusal. Specific problems with documentation of refusals at disposition included: appropriate mental status, speech, and gait; release with an accompanying family member or friend; and parental notification and approval of care for minors. There also was an initial tendency not to establish on-line [direct] medical control for ALS refusal or BLS medicolegal issues. CONCLUSION(S): The medical system configuration modeled after practices of prehospital care, demonstrates physicians did not need to be on-site when adequate EMS medical control existed with less than 30 minutes on-scene time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most farmers are exposed to potentially hazardous noise levels through many of their work activities, such as operating tractors, grain dryers, and chain saws. Rates of noise-induced hearing loss in this group are high. Although this condition is preventable through the use of hearing protection, rates of protective device use are low. Understanding factors influencing the use of hearing protection devices will provide direction for programs to increase their use and decrease risk of noise-induced hearing loss. OBJECTIVE(S): A study was designed using the Pender Health Promotion Model to identify factors affecting farmers' use of hearing protection devices. METHOD(S): Model testing was conducted with a convenience sample of 139 farmers. Prior to model testing, existing instruments designed to measure concepts from the Health Promotion Model were modified for use with farmers through interviews, validity testing with an expert panel, and reliability testing with first a small (n = 36) then a second larger (n = 139) convenience sample of farmers. Instruments measuring cognitive and affective factors related to hearing protection device use were administered to farmers at a regional farm show in the Midwest. RESULT(S): A logistic regression analysis identified interpersonal support, barriers, and situational influences as statistically significant predictors of this health behavior, correctly predicting 78% of the cases. Results of model testing were consistent with results of previous studies of Health Promotion Model variables with other worker groups' use of hearing protection. CONCLUSION(S): Information from this study can be used to design and evaluate interventions to promote hearing protection device use among farmers and reduce the level of noise-induced hearing loss in this high-risk and underserved worker group.

AB  - Two solutions to the problem of excessive noise exposure and consequent hearing loss in motorcyclists were investigated and are described. One was an antecedent behaviour-modifying 'prompting' strategy, where a set of earplugs and an advice sheet were provided at the point of sale to consecutive purchasers of new motorcycle crash helmets. Forty-eight riders were recruited but data for analysis were only available in 41. The earplug usage rate was significantly Increased from 27% to 83% by this intervention. The second solution involves various aerodynamic and sound-proofing helmet modifications made in an effort to reduce interior noise levels. The only modification which achieved a significant reduction from previously reported average sound levels was the incorporation of a pair of 'standard' earmuffs under the helmet shell. This gave noise levels of 84 dB(A) at 22 m/s (50 mph) and 93 dB(A) at 36 m/s (80 mph), compared to known average values of 95 dB(A) and 107 dB(A), respectively. Both solutions are eminently feasible and desirable, and we hope that the motorcycle industry will act on them.

AB  - Motor bike-riders at higher speed are exposed to high noise levels caused by air turbulences at the helmet, which might impair hearing faculty. By means of a miniature-microphone the noise was measured in the driver's ear and analysed for different types of helmets and motorcycles. Noise damping measures are dicussed. The personal protection by wearing ear plugs and the influence on perceiving acoustical signals are presented in detail.

AB  - The noise load of an orchestra musician depends on several factors. An evaluation of literature shows that orchestra musicians are regularly exposed to sound levels that are likely to cause hearing loss. The results of audiometric studies carried out in orchestra musicians, with special regard to occupation-related hearing impairments have been contradictory. These contradictions are mainly of methodic nature. It is very likely that the noise-load received by an orchestra musician - at least in some cases - is the cause of considerable hearing loss. Apart from the kind and intensity of the sound volume, the individual's sensitivity to noise also seems to play an important part. Since an intact sense of hearing is of vital interest for musicians, it is proposed to classify the workplace 'orchestra' as an area with a high-noise level and to apply the existing preventive measures against hearing impairments providing appropriate hearing protection devices and regular preventive occupational health surveys. However, the audiometric examinations carried out in musicians, should not be assessed by means of reference values developed with regard to avoiding any impairment of speech audition. The emphasis should rather be laid on individual follow-ups. Only the early detection of permanent hearing impairment makes it possible to prevent hearing deterioration from further at an early stage.

AB  - Sixty forestry workers have been studied to determine the presence of hearing loss due to noise exposure and his evolution during the period between 2000 and 2004. Workers were classified into two exposure groups: between 85 and 90 dB(A) (28 subjects) and more than 90 dB(A) (32 subjects). Hearing tests have been performed every year in subjects exposed to more than 90 dB(A) and every two years in the other group, classifing the audiograms following the Merluzzi, Pira and Bosio Scale (MPB) and taking into account aggravations too. Audiogram analysis at the start of the study shows a prevalence of hearing loss due to noise in 28.1% of subjects exposed to more than 90 dB(A) and in 35.7% of subjects exposed to less than 90 dB(A). After 4 years such prevalences rose to 34.4% and 37.5%, respectively. The aggravations observed were 4 in the less exposed group and 2 in the more exposed one. The higher prevalence and aggravations of hearing loss in the less exposed group may be explained by a lesser use of the hearing protection devices.

AB  - The hearing of 1802 textile workers exposed to noise and 1247 metal workers are reviewed, noting that the latter were affected earlier than the former by professionnal deafness. The average noise levels of these industries (95 dB for the textile industry and 105 dB for metallurgy) and the discontinuity of noise in metal works are considered. A fairly large proportion of metal workers (21%) are subject to severe loss of hearing after 16 yr work whereas the some statistic are found in weavers after 25 yr work. Reimbursable deafness was found in the metal industry after 10 yr work and yet only after 22 yr work in the textile industry. The position of the health visitor in the industry under his surveillance is summarised: what criteria make a particular post dangerous for the hearing and at what noise level; medical supervision of the workers, help to be given to the E.N.T. specialists in the audiometric examinations; study of the possibilities of improving the noise level by technical means; efforts made in the area of individual protection by means of ear protectors.

AB  - A total of 524 industrial workers were studied. They consisted of 442 noise exposed and 82 non-noise exposed workers. The purpose was to compare the prevalence of sensori-neural hearing loss among the noise exposed and the non-noise exposed workers, to study their knowledge on the hazard of noise to hearing and the workers' attitude towards the hearing protection devices. The prevalence of sensori-neural hearing loss was significantly higher among the noise exposed workers, i.e., 83% versus 31.7% (p < 0.01). However, the prevalence of hearing impairment was much lower for both groups, being 30.1% for the noise exposed and 3.7% for the non-noise exposed group. Although hearing protection devices were provided to 80.5% of the workers, only 5.1% were wearing them regularly. The possibility of developing hearing loss due to exposure to excessive noise was only known by 35.5% of the noise exposed workers. This awareness was found to have a positive correlation with the workers' compliance to the hearing protection devices. Our findings highlight the need for workers to be educated on the hazards of excessive noise exposure to hearing.

AB  - The Health Promotion Model (HPM) was tested as a causal model to predict workers' use of hearing protection (N = 645). Measures indicated an excellent fit of the theoretical model. The exploratory analyses found the same cognitive-perceptual factors most important in predicting use. However, in contrast to the theoretical model, two modifying factors (job category and situational factors) had direct effects on use. The hypothesized model accounted for 49.3% of variance and the exploratory models accounted for 50.7% to 52.7% of variance in hearing protection use. Results of testing the HPM are consistent with the recently proposed revision of the model by Pender, Walker, Frank-Stromborg, and Sechrist (1990a, 1990b). The strongest effects on behavior came from the behavior-specific influences and demographic characteristics. Situational factors had a direct effect on the health behavior.

The strongest predictors were self-efficacy, benefits, value, and barriers. Items in the barriers scale were most strongly correlated with use and had the greatest potential for change. Therefore, items from this scale are being used as the primary basis for development of a training intervention program.

AB  - The health promotion model (HPM) was tested as a causal model of construction workers' use of hearing protection (N = 359). Theoretical and exploratory models fit well, with the theoretical model accounting for 36.3% of variance and the exploratory model accounting for 50.6% of variance in hearing protection use. Value of use (benefits of using hearing protection), barriers to use, and self-efficacy were significant predictors in both the theoretical and exploratory models, but perceived health status was a predictor only in the theoretical model. In the exploratory model, where modifying factors were allowed direct relationships with use of hearing protection, two modifying factors--noise exposure and interpersonal influences-modeling--were significant predictors. Results of this test of the HPM are consistent with the revised HPM (Pender, 1996). There were significant direct paths from modifying factors to behaviour. Use of hearing protection was best predicted by behavior-specific predictors, such as perceived barriers to use of hearing protection. Results support the use of the HPM to predict use of hearing protection.

Operating engineers, carpenters, and plumbers/pipe fitters in the Midwest in=400) completed a written questionnaire regarding their use of HPDs and their perceptions of noise exposure and hearing loss. Subjects were recruited through their trade union groups. Mean reported use of HPDs and mean perceived noise exposure were compared across trade groups. Bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques were used to assess relationships between use of HPDs and trade category, education, age, years of employment, noise exposure, and hearing loss. Bivariate analyses identified significant differences in mean use of HPDs by age, years of employment, and trade group. Multivariate logistic regression assessing the independent effects of these variables found significant differences only by trade group. Results indicate a need for significant improvement in all three trade groups' use of HPDs, and suggest a need to consider use and exposure levels, demographics, and trade group membership in designing hearing conservation programs.

AB  - The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health targeted noise-induced hearing loss as one of the top 10 occupational hazards. Research has been directed toward reducing noise exposure rather than identifying the factors associated with workers' decision consistently to use hearing protection. The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop a causal model explaining workers' use of hearing protection to guide development of nursing interventions. This study was a preliminary one to prepare for testing Pender's health-promotion model (HPM) as a causal model. Ninety-eight skilled tradesmen completed written questionnaires at their work site. Although 98% indicated they were supposed to wear protection, their reported use averaged 50.3% of the time. Reported use significantly and positively correlated with workers' perceptions of the benefits and self-efficacy of use, value of outcomes regarding keeping out noise and increased well-being, and health-promoting behaviors in the areas of self-actualization and stress management. Perceptions of barriers of use were significantly and negatively related to use. In regression analyses of use of hearing protection on components of the HPM and dimensions of health behavior and lifestyle, one component of the HPM (benefits) and two dimensions of health behavior and lifestyle (self-actualization and interpersonal support) significantly predicted use, accounting for 24% of the variance in use of protection. Knowledge of the predictors of hearing protection use will ultimately aid nurses in implementing interventions, increasing use, and decreasing hearing losses.

AB  - Environmental noise levels in the United States are increasing, yet there are few studies in which the nonauditory effects of workplace noise are assessed. In the current study, the authors examined chronic effects of noise on blood pressure and heart rate in 374 workers at an automobile plant. Data were collected from subjects prior to the start of their workshift. Participants completed questionnaires about diet, alcohol use, lifestyle, noise annoyance, use of hearing protection, noise exposure outside of the work environment, personal and family health histories, and demographic information. Resting blood pressure, heart rate, and body mass index were obtained. Noise exposure levels were extracted retrospectively from company records for each participant for the past 5 yr. Summary statistics were generated for each variable, and the authors performed bivariate correlations to identify any unadjusted associations. The authors then completed statistical modeling to investigate the effects of noise on blood pressure and heart rate, after they controlled for other variables (e.g., gender, race, age). The authors controlled for confounding variables, after which use of hearing protection in high-noise areas was a significant predictor of a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The results suggested that the reduction of noise exposure by means of engineering controls or by consistent use of hearing protection by workers may positively affect health outcomes.

AB  - An informal observation of hearing test results of employees in hearing conservation programs noted hearing losses among younger workers. As part of a community service project for the Arizona Valle del Sol Association of Occupational Health Nurses, a pilot hearing conservation program was implemented in two junior high schools in Mesa, Arizona. Occupational health nurses conducted sound level measurements in band rooms and industrial technology (shop) classes. Members of the professional association then taught classes of seventh, eighth, and ninth graders about the effects of noise on hearing; how to protect their hearing and use hearing protection; and how to keep their ears clean. Pre- and post-tests were distributed. Sound levels ranged from about 80 to 110 decibels in band rooms and 95-110 decibels in shop rooms. The post-tests revealed increases in knowledge regarding the effects of noise on hearing, ways to determine if noise is damaging to hearing, and safe measures to clean ears. Students also indicated a willingness to wear hearing protection when exposed to noise. The success of this pilot program supports the expansion of a partnership between industry and schools with the goal of hearing conservation.

AB  - Objective. To assess the impact of occupational exposure to noise, as well as its relationship with other factors that can induce hearing loss. Material and methods. In January and February 1997, we conducted sonometry and dosimetry tests in a cement factory, as well as audiometric test in 85 cement workers, to identify sources of noise and evaluate the effect to noise exposure and other factors, of the prevalence of occupational hearing loss. Statistical analysis was conducted using measures of central tendency, bivariate analysis and polynominal regression models. Results. High noise levels were found in the crushing, crude milling, and cement milling sites. The highest individual dose corresponded to the packer job post. Fifty-five per cent of the study population presented some degree of hearing loss due to noise exposure. The cement processing area with the highest percentage of damaged workers was calcination. Conclusions. Our results show that noise is a serious risk factor in particular sites of cement factories, and also that an elevated number of hearing loss cases are due to occupational noise exposure in this industry; Our findings underscore the need for designing and implementing hearing protection programs, to assure the health and safety of cement workers.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Noise induced hearing loss with its consequences and diagnosis, the taking of an audiogram and the measuring methods, are described. Many people are constantly exposed to harmful noise, causing irreparable damage to the peripheral hearing organ and interfering with the understanding of everyday speech. Noise that is below the danger threshold and does not damage the peripheral hearing organ can still be very annoying and may produce psychologic problems of irritation and decreased powers of concentration. Damage to the peripheral hearing organ can readily be recorded by audiometry, provided this is done in a suitable environment by a trained examiner. It is far more difficult to detect the extraauditory effects of noise on organs or systems other than the hearing organ. Noise should be prevented at its source or between the source and the exposed subject. If technical preventive measures are impracticable the employee should be taught to wear ear defenders, but it must be remembered that these are only a stop gap measure.

AB  - To study the communication quality and the protection effects of single protector and the combined ones, sound attenuation experiments and the communication experiments were conducted in 14 male subjects. The results showed that the sound attenuation of combined protectors were 13 dB or 6dB more than that of single earplug or earmuff respectively, and combined protectors could avoid sound attenuation caused by the harmonics on some frequency bands in single one. After combined usage, the single protector reduced the distortion which came from the overload of hearing organs and maintained the communication quality. The combined protector is an effective hearing protection device in high noise environment in aerospace field.

AB  - A method of ear muff selection has been suggested whereby the attenuation provided by the muff, measured as the SLC80 value, the muff weight and clamping force are combined to provide a rating index. A range of muffs selected on this basis was tested in a number of Australian sawmills to determine their acceptance among the workers in these mills. A specific relationship between the rating index and wearer acceptance was not clearly established, although a number of muffs with the highest indices were favourably rated by wearers and others with the lowest values were rated unfavourably.

AB  - Noise attenuation by linear hearing protection devices (HPDs) is considered to be independent of the environmental noise level. Linearity of HPDs is one of the basic assumptions underlying the Real Ear Attenuation at the Threshold (REAT) method of HPD testing, which utilizes quiet conditions. However, non-linear growth of masking at high intensity levels may result in the effects of HPDs on detection of speech and warning signals being different from those at high noise levels. The purpose of this study was to determine if the non-linear growth of masking can affect detection of warble signals by persons using HPDs in wideband noise presented at the 100 dB(A) level. Audiometric thresholds of hearing of 10 listeners were measured under four experimental conditions: (1) noise off, HPDs off (condition C1); (2) noise off, HPDs on (condition C2), (3) noise on, HPDs on (condition C3); and (4) noise on, HPDs off (condition C4). The results of this study indicate that detection of signals by persons using HPDs in noise <100dB(A) can be well predicted from noise attenuation characteristics of HPDs measured in quiet without the need for a correction factor accommodating non-linear growth of masking. This finding has implications for predicting the audibility of warning signals in noise by persons wearing HPDs.

AB  - Practical experiments carried out with people exposed to tractor noise have shown that no impairment is caused in the ability of persons with normal hearing to hear acoustic signals as a result of wearing individual hearing protection devices. Even improvements have been observed by the authors of this paper and other authors. There is a worsening of signal audibility in persons with hearing impairments. The limit up to which there is no deterioration was fixed at a hearing impairment of 15 per cent according to Fowler-Sabine. Provisions governing the use of individual hearing protection devices in the GDR's transport service have been worked out on the basis of these results.

AB  - NIOSH conducted field investigations in 1977 and 1981 to determine the actual noise reduction afforded to industrial workers who used insert-type hearing protectors (earplugs) daily. In-situ attenuation tests of 420 workers at 15 industrial plants were conducted to determine the noise reduction provided by earplugs as they were worn during the workday. The workplace results, when compared to manufacturers' best-fit laboratory test results, indicated that 50% of the workers tested were receiving less than one-half the potential attenuation of the earplugs.

AB  - This paper describes a study investigating attitudes to noise as an occupational hazard. The objectives of the study were to understand the individual and organizational factors which affect attitudes towards noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and to relate these to the standards of hearing conservation achieved in industry as demonstrated by compliance with the Noise at Work Regulations. The study comprised a survey of 48 organizations across Britain, and a more detailed examination of 10 of these as case studies. Methods used included desk research, audits of hearing conservation programmes, questionnaires and interviews. Whilst there is widespread acceptance that industrial noise is a hazard, it is one that is frequently taken for granted, and measures to deal with it are often inadequate. Most organizations place the onus on the workforce to protect their own hearing through the use of personal hearing protectors. Workers reactions to noise tended however to be passive and much of the time neither managers nor the workforce are conscious of the noise hazard. This is the case even where some managers are committed to good industrial housekeeping and accident prevention. An effective hearing conservation programme requires three management attributes: leadership from senior management, the ability of middle management (particularly in production and engineering) to put hearing conservation measures into practice, and specialist technical knowledge of noise and of the legislation. The study points to the need for more education and motivation of senior managers as the priority in improving standards of hearing conservation and noise control.

AB  - This prospective study of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) from exposure to impulse noise during compulsory military service focused on three issues: the number of shot or explosion impulses that the conscript was exposed to at the time of AAT, distance of injured ear from causal firearm, and the circumstances under which AAT occurred in protected ears. The series includes 449 consecutive, verified cases of AAT seen at the Central Military Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, in the period 1989-1993. AAT usually occurred during combat training (87%) as a result of exposure to impulses from small arms (83%). In 41%, AAT was caused by a single shot or detonation impulse. As many as 92% of all AATs occurred within 2 m of the causal firearm. Fourteen percent were wearing hearing protectors when the accident took place, but every third had badly fitting protectors or had neglected safety regulations and used insufficient protection. Of all AATs caused by one noise impulse in protected ears, 83% were attributable to heavy arms and only 14% to small arms. The results of the study suggest that combined use of earmuffs and earplugs in association with a safe distance of over 5 m from the noise source gives adequate protection against AAT. However, for conscripts using certain heavy arms, e.g. bazooka, more effective hearing protection should be developed.

AB  - In studying noise induced hearing loss it is important to note: whether there has been ear damaging stress; whether the onset of hardness of hearing connects with noise exposure; and whether it is possible to exclude toxious, traumatic, metabolic, and circulatory lesions as additional causes. Vestibular symptoms do not belong to the clinical picture of noise induced hearing loss. Tinnitus does not contribute as a complaint. Audiometrically noise induced hearing loss is a high frequency lesion, according to criteria of supraliminal audiometry, originating from damage of the inner ear sensory cells. The expert's opinion is incomplete unless a noise recruitment Sisi test, Luscher test, or Langenbeck test is undertaken. The acoustic impedance test threshold may be used in Metz recruitment only if positive recruitment is proved by other specific tests, otherwise the persistance of the acoustico facial reflex (AFR) may indicate a central nervous hearing impairment if occurring together with disorder of dichotic discrimination. Causal relationship between questionable noise exposure and hearing impairment is denied (at least concerning the greater part of hearing loss) if audiometrical findings correspond to hearing loss owing to neural or central neural lesions. It is unlikely when a hearing impairment is caused by lesion of the inner ear, as in noise induced hearing loss or with hearing loss in middle and even low frequencies. The degree of disablement is deducted from audiometrical classification as in slight, medium and severe hearing impairment or hearing impairment close to deafness. Hearing loss which is induced by noise regularly is approximately symmetrical and seldom exceeds medium hearing loss, which means a degree of disablement of 30%. In case of resulting higher percentages of degree of disablement there should be excluded noxious agents independent of noise. A change of workplace or regular noise intermissions for prophylaxis versus progression of noise induced hearing loss are necessary, the more urgent, and the faster hearing impairment has developed, (and the younger the noise exposed employee is). Individual ear protectors are recommended.

AB  - This paper describes the physical relationships and the influence of human factors during direct speech communication. New research results based on the articulation index (AI) are presented and an extended version of the AI is discussed. A modified AI includes all the important parameters for speech communication such as the vocal effort, the LOMBARD effect, the masked threshold, the noise fluctuation, the decrease in intelligibility through speech signal distortions at high sound pressure levels, the sound propagation, the hearing loss of the listener, and, finally, the use of ear protectors. In a proposal for an ISO-document, the relationship between the permissible noise level as the speech-interference-level and the distance between speaker and listener for a satisfactory speech intelligibility is presented. Special emphasis is placed on the higher noise levels. In addition, the strain on both speaker and listener was ascertained experimentally and scaled for different communication situations. A simple model is shown for evaluating direct speech communication by accounting for the strain on both the speaker and listener.

AB  - Sonometric and dosimetric measurements of noise at a dozen workplaces of three divisions in a refinery-petrochemical plant have been made. The equivalent level allowable with a view to hearing protection was found to be exceeded by 1-3 dBA at some workplaces. The tonal audiometric test was used to determine threshold levels for 250-8000 Hz frequencies in 122 workers. The present acoustic conditions at the test workplaces do not pose a risk of a significant hearing loss. Only a slight high-frequency hearing loss which might result from noise exposure was diagnosed. Not a single case of occupational hearing impairment conformable with the mandatory diagnostic and certificatory rules was reported.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine how and when the personnel of the Finnish National Opera are exposed to noise and whether exposure depends on musical selection of repertoire. Additionally, an evaluation of sound exposure level due to individual rehearsals was included. The measurements were done using individual noise dosimeters and fixed-point measurements. From the measurements, annual noise exposure in the Opera was evaluated. The conductors, dancers, and double bass players were exposed to levels below 85 decibels, A-weighted, dB(A), which is the national action level. The choir members were exposed to sound levels of 92 and 94 dB(A). Within the orchestra, the highest sound exposure levels were found among percussionists, 95 dB(A); flute/piccolo players, 95 dB(A); and brass players, 92-94 dB(A). Other sound exposure levels among orchestra members varied from 83 to 89 dB(A). Soloists and rehearsal pianists are likely to be exposed to sound levels exceeding the national action level. From an exposure perspective, the individual rehearsals, 79-100 dB(A), proved to be as important as performances and group rehearsals, 82-99 dB(A), among orchestra musicians and choir singers. The ambient sound level for the lighting crew was 76 +/- 4 dB(A). However, the measured sound levels at the ear varied from 77 to 92 dB(A) due to the communication via headphones that had individual volume control. For the majority of personnel of the Finnish National Opera, sound exposure level exceeded the national action level value of 85 dB(A). Artists exceeded the action level during both individual and group rehearsals, as well as during performances. Hearing protection has been designed for musicians. Education/reinforcement is required to ensure it is worn.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute acoustic trauma (AAT) refers to damage to sensitive cochlear structures caused by excessive exposure to impulse noise. The aim of this study was to 1) assess the incidence of ATT in French soldiers and 2) to clarify the circumstances under which AAT occurs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective study of ATT events reported to medical officers in 1998. RESULT(S): The incidence of AAT was 156 per 100,000 person-years (150- 161). It was higher in conscripts and in soldiers aged under 31 years. Fifty- seven percent were wearing hearing protectors when the accident took place. CONCLUSION(S): According to these results, specific preventive programs were planned and should be assessed by epidemiological surveillance of exposed populations.

AB  - To make a choice of ear protector noise rating level, ear diagnosis, and frequency dependence of the attenuation must be considered. By connecting noise rating level with typical sounds caused by different methods of working and with 3 single attenuations of ear protectors for 3 frequency ranges is shown a simplified method of making a choice of ear protector. Thereby the ear diagnosis by an industrial physician is an important factor. The partially great differences between attenuations of different manufactores of ear protectors must be considered, too.

AB  - Pure-tone hearing thresholds and anamnestic data pertaining to nosocusis and exposure to gun noise were analyzed for 9778 male railroad train-crew workers. A major portion of losses in hearing sensitivity due to railroad noise are obscured in comparisons of hearing levels of trainmen with the hearing levels of the unscreened samples of United States males given in Annex B, ISO 1999 [ISO 1999 (1990), ''Acoustics - Determination of occupational noise exposure and estimation of noise-induced hearing impairment'' (International Organization for Standardization, Geneva)]. Comparisons of the hearing levels, adjusted for nosocusis, of trainmen who had used no guns, with the hearing levels of otologically and noise screened males (Annex A, ISO 1999) reveal significant losses due to railroad noise. Additional losses were found at high frequencies in trainmen who had used guns. It appears that the effective Leq8h exposure level of trainmen to railroad noise is about 92 dBA, and 87-89 dBA to gun noise. These results are in general agreement with those of study of railway workers by Prosser et al. [Br. J. Audiol. 22, 85-91 (1988)]. Asymmetries in losses between the two ears, effects of ear protection, losses from nosocusis, and losses from sport, as compared to military, gun noise exposures, are examined.

AB  - The evaluation of acoustic conditions in four elementary schools showed high levels of noise inside schools, especially in corridors. It refers mainly public schools, which generally are overcrowded. During breaks the most frequent noise level is 86 dB but in some parts of corridors approaches values 95-98 dB. During lessons the noise in corridors decreases to about 64 dB. However during physical exercises which take place in corridors the noise level in corridors increases up to 75-80 dB. In public schools the noise levels in corridors both during lessons and breaks are higher about 12 dB than in private schools. However during lessons in classrooms those differences are quite lower. The noise level during lessons depends mainly on number of pupils, subject of the lesson, year of schooling and period of duration of the lesson. Considerable growth of noise occurs in classes above 20 pupils and at initial and final period of the lesson. The most favourable acoustic conditions are in classes below 15 pupils but in classes above 20 pupils the noise levels increase average about 4 dB. In spite of common opinion the noise level is lower in classes with younger children than in classes with older children. In older classes the noise is higher average about 3 dB. The noise in classroom depends also on manner of teaching and type of tasks performed by schoolchildren. The work in group is noisiest (average more 8 dB than during lectures). It refers especially to gymnastics lessons during group games. In this case the noise levels usually are above 90 dB. However it was not observed significant differences in daily or weekly distribution of the noise level during lessons. Resultant daily noise exposure of schoolchildren during their school time is 80 dB (or sometimes 85 dB) in public schools and 72 dB in private schools. Average noise exposure in public schools approaches critical values accepted for hearing protection for adolescents during apprenticeship.

AB  - Acoustic conditions in the classrooms of vocational schools are comparable with those in high schools. However, much worse acoustic conditions are observed in vocational school workshop. The evaluation of acoustic conditions in 712 school shops showed, that noise exposure of schoolchildren is very various and depends upon type of workshop and tasks performed by schoolchildren. The major source of noise exposure is machinery in mechanic workshops (plastic working--up to 105 dB, machine noise-from 80 to 90 dB), in textile workshops--from 90 to 100 dB and woodworking machines-from 92 to 102 dB. It should be noted that in such acoustic conditions schoolchildren stay for a relatively long time. Average exposure time of schoolchildren in mechanic or textile workshops was about 4.5 hours. At another training subjects i.e. electric, building, welding craft or gastronomy--noise exposure is usually below recommended standards (80 dB). The critical values accepted for hearing protection for occupational exposure (85 dB) were exceeded at 10% investigated training places of schoolchildren. This mostly occurred in mechanic workshops. Taking into account increased sensitivity of young people it would be worthwhile to work out separate criteria in this range for school workshops. Tentatively, problem should be solved by shortening exposure time depending on actual noise level.

AB  - The factor of decisive influence on the acoustic climate in rooms is the inner noise, which is dependent in schools on the activity of children, overcrowding of classes and inadequate use of technical protective means. The inappropriate location of schools, although also important from the standpoint of acoustics, is a much lower source of noise than it is generally assumed. Particularly unfavourable acoustic conditions are in elementary schools with over 300 children in one shift. The spaces with the highest noise level include corridors, especially during recesses between lessons. The noise level in them is in the range of an equivalent sound A 60-95 dB, and the most frequent noise level is 80 dB. In a large part of schools the acoustic conditions in the corridors during recesses approach the critical values accepted for hearing protection in industrial plants, in some schools they are even exceeded. The situation is also unfavourable in other rooms such as doctor's office, director's room, reading rooms, rooms for teachers. These rooms are situated usually without taking into consideration of the acoustic conditions. This is particularly true of teachers' rooms which should give the teachers the possibility of resting before the next lesson. During lessons the noise level decreases in all rooms. However, the noisiest among them, corridors, classes situated near the hall for physical exercises and day-room, have still up to about 65 dB noise level. Generally speaking, in about 60% of rooms the acoustic conditions are below the recommended standard. The main cause, apart from overcrowding of schools, is low acoustic absorption ability of school rooms, and poor acoustic insulation ability of the doors in schools.

AB  - Comparative analysis among 357 inhabitants, who live in two areas: noisy (above 70 dB /A/) and moderate (below 57 dB /A/) showed significant differences between the groups in many variables under consideration. This differences, after eliminating socio-economic influences and behavior factors such as: gender, age, economical conditions, education or smoking confirmed existence of relation between living condition caused by motorization and life quality, well-being and self assessed health of inhabitants. Details showed, that urban intensive traffic noise disturbs realization of many important daily activities, evoke emotional tension, irritation, nervousness. In group of people from noisy areas more often are observed characteristic mental pressure caused by noise, throat and eyes irritation, disturbances in rest, speech, listen to music, sleep, and when going to sleep. Feeling of discomfort and annoyance dominates. More often there is a need to close or seal up the windows, use earplugs or take a sleeping pills. Relative risk of appearance of disturbances mentioned above or mental and emotional reactions in group of people who are exposed to high noise from 3 do 6 times bigger in comparison with people from quiet area. Apart from a decrease in the mental comfort and live quality, intensive traffic noise has a big influence on well-being and self assessed health status. The intensification of complaints and symptoms of neurotic character are observed in noisy areas. Most of these problems are connected with cardiovascular system (palpitation, constriction in chest, hot flush, tiredness after effort) and excessive nervous stimulation. Long lasting influence of noise is probably also a cause for a frequent nervousness, feeling of tiredness after night sleep and overstress, troubles with concentration or distinct reduction of well-being (feel unhappy and miserable, inability to cope with troubles, reduce ability to take of decisions). Additionally, the escalation of troubles probably connected with bigger air pollution (frequent dry cough, sneezing, nasal stuffing) is observed in areas of intensive traffic noise. Relative risk of appearance mentioned above unfavourably health symptoms in group of people from noisy areas is about 1.5 times higher than in areas below 57 dB /A/. Analyzed data did not confirm hypothesis on influence of traffic noise on increasing appearance of diseases confirmed by physician. In both areas noisy and quiet morbidity are similar. Also consumption of medicines was similar.

AB  - The dependence of the use of hearing protectors on the following factors is investigated: noise level, duration of exposure, class of industry, geographical region, hearing ability. The data were taken from 191 938 routine audiometric tests carried out from 1976 to 1983. It can be shown that the percentage of workers using hearing protectors grew by a factor of 2. Further measures to increase the use of hearing protectors are necessary with claiming priority to the following groups: women, workers with hearing impairment, people working in high noise areas. Additionally, it has to be taken care that workers use adequate hearing protectors.

AB  - Adolescents working in agricultural settings may be exposed to noise levels that result in hearing loss. The article describes the design, implementation, and results of a four-year, hearing conservation program (HCP) conducted at school. Thirty-four schools (753 students) were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. The intervention included multicomponent educational strategies and employed features of an industrial HCP. Final compliance surveys indicated 87.5% of intervention students reported using hearing protection devices (HPD) at least some of the time, compared to 45% of control students. The HCP components with the greatest reported influence were distribution of HPDs for use on the farm and yearly hearing tests. Eighty percent of intervention students reported intention to use HPDs in the future. It is feasible to conduct a hearing conservation program with junior high school and senior high school students, and it appears possible to persuade teen-agers to protect themselves from exposure to loud noise while working on a farm.

AB  - In a cold rolling plant, 780 employees were questioned anonymously regarding their preparedness to wear individual ear protectors. All those questioned were obliged to wear ear protectors owing to the degree of noise to which they were exposed. There exists a causal connection between the workers' preparedness to wear ear protectors and their degree of insight into the noise induced stress at the work place and its effect on health. The preparedness to wear ear protectors increases as workers grow older and have been working in the cold rolling plant for more years. 30% of the maintenance staff and 82% of the machine drivers in the production plant wear ear protectors, but only 4 and 23%, respectively, wear them constantly, the others only occasionally. There exist no particular groups of persons who are especially suitable or unsuitable for the wearing of ear protectors. Certain conclusions are presented with a view to enhancing the preparedness to wear ear protectors and improving policlinical supervision of laborers exposed to excessive noise.

AB  - Objective. This analysis estimates the first nationally representative prevalence of noise-induced hearing threshold shifts (NITS) among US children. Historically, NITS has not been considered a common cause of childhood hearing problems. Among children, NITS can be a progressive problem with continued exposure to excessive noise, which can lead to high-frequency sound discrimination difficulties (eg, speech consonants and whistles). Methods. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) was conducted from 1988 to 1994. NHANES III is a national population-based cross-sectional survey with a household interview, audiometric testing at 0.5 to 8 kHz, and compliance testing. A total of 5249 children aged 6 to 19 years completed audiometry and compliance testing for both ears in NHANES III. The criteria used to assess NITS included audiometry indicating a noise notch in at least 1 ear. Results. Of US children 6 to 19 years old, 12.5% (approximately 5.2 million) are estimated to have NITS in 1 or both ears. In the majority of the children meeting NITS criteria, only 1 ear and only 1 frequency are affected. In this analysis, all children identified with NITS passed compliance testing, which essentially rules out middle ear disorders such as conductive hearing loss. The prevalence estimate of NITS differed by sociodemographics, including age and sex. Conclusions. These findings suggest that children are being exposed to excessive amounts of hazardous levels of noise, and children's hearing is vulnerable to these exposures. These data support the need for research on appropriate hearing conservation methods and for NITS screening programs among school-aged children. Public health interventions such as education, training, audiometric testing, exposure assessment, hearing protection, and noise control when feasible are all components of occupational hearing conservation that could be adapted to children's needs with children-specific research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexican American workers are vulnerable to noise-induced hearing loss, the most common occupational disease in the United States. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose was to test the applicability of the Health Promotion Model to Mexican American workers' use of hearing protection devices. METHOD(S): A correlational descriptive design and path analysis were used to determine the relationships between cognitive-perceptual factors, modifying factors and use of hearing protection devices. A questionnaire was completed by a total of 119 workers in three garment manufacturing plants. Interviews were conducted with the occupational health nurse or safety director in each plant to determine the policy regarding hearing protection also. RESULT(S): Factors that directly influenced the use of hearing protection devices were a clinical definition of health, benefits of and barriers to use of hearing protection devices, self-efficacy in the use of hearing protection devices and perceived health status (R2 =.25, p <.01). An exploratory analysis allowing a direct relationship of modifying factors with the dependent variable explained additional variance in use of hearing protection devices through the contribution of situational factors (R2 =.55, p <.01). CONCLUSION(S): Important factors related to Mexican American workers' use of hearing protection devices were identified to provide direction for nursing interventions. Future research should further test the explanatory capabilities of the Health Promotion Model, explore the importance of situational influences on health behavior, and ensure reliable measures of all model components for this population.

AB  - Presbyacusis that to some extent is the end result of a chronic flow of noise from childhood onwards can, in the assessment of the loss of earning capacity because of noise deafness, be considered as a predominating factor only when it seems that it is unlikely that a significant correlation exists between the time of exposure to noise and the degree of the hearing loss. Remission or improvement of more than 10 Db (A) is seen not only in young employees in the first year of exposure to noise but also in older ones after 10 or more years in special circumstances such as long weekends, use of hearing protectors, change of job, sickness holidays, pensioning etc. The possibilities of early detection of the noise deafness and its prophylaxis are pointed out.

AB  - We have had experience of an 18-month-old boy with a cardiomyopathy who died a few minutes after removal of his cast with a saw, apparently from a malignant cardiac arrhythmia triggered by anxiety. We therefore examined the anxiety reaction to this method of removal of a plaster cast in 20 healthy children; ten were provided with hearing protectors and ten were not. The level of anxiety was assessed by measuring the heart rate, a known physiological indicator of anxiety, before, during and five minutes after removal of the cast. The noise level was also measured. The results showed a mean increase in heart rate during the procedure of 27.9 beats per minute (bmp) (26.9%) in the children with no hearing protectors and 10.4 bmp (11.1%) in children who used hearing protectors (p<0.001). Five minutes after the procedure the heart rate had returned to the baseline rate in all patients. We recommend that hearing protectors should be used in children undergoing removal of a plaster cast to decrease the anxiety reaction. If possible, clinicians should avoid the use of a saw for this purpose in children with a cardiomyopathy.

AB  - A systematic random sample of 405 workers from metal, asbestos cement pipes, textile, and viscose rayon industries were interviewed using a prepared and tested questionnaire. Personal Protective Devices (PPDs), namely goggles, gloves, respirators, and ear defenders, had been distributed to all workers on the payroll and were used by 31.4%. Usage of PPDs was associated with the educational level, duration of occupation, awareness of the work hazards, and knowledge about the purpose of PPDs. Marked association was found between nonusage of PPDs and discomfort, interference with job performance, and the psychological feeling of lowering the person's prestige by the wearing of PPDs. Nonusage was also associated with lack of maintenance of the device and absence of supervision of its usage. Users were more numerous among married workers and workers with urban residence than among unmarried workers and those with rural residence, respectively. No association could be found between the rate of usage and the worker's age except for ear plugs, for which nonusage was proportional to the worker's age. The most important factors were those related to the role of the safety staff and the discomfort of the devices. Recommendations for occupational health authorities on the basis of the above evaluation are suggested.

AB  - Cairo is a city well-known for its noisy and crowded traffic. The job nature of traffic policemen in Cairo necessitates standing beside traffic light signals to observe that car drivers obey these signals. In this study road traffic noise was measured at different places in Cairo and hearing threshold was determined among 126 traffic policemen and 50 controls (office policemen). Road traffic noise ranged from 72 to 110 dB (A). The highest values were observed at railway crossings and when drivers used their horn (which is frequent). Mean hearing threshold of traffic policemen was significantly higher than that of the controls. The pattern of hearing impairment of traffic policemen was typical for that induced by noise. This was still obvious after age correction of the hearing threshold. The results indicate that road traffic noise in Cairo constitutes a hazard for hearing or those whose job necessitates continuous and long-term exposure to it. Better regulation of traffic and strict control of the use of car horns are needed. The use of ear protectors may be recommended for traffic policemen.

AB  - The study aimed to explore the knowledge and attitudes of a group of mine workers regarding noise induced hearing loss and the use of hearing protective devices. These aims were investigated via a questionnaire administered in a group setting to 55 underground mine workers. The main finding that emerged from the study was that respondents were poorly informed regarding the fact that noise was a health hazard. Furthermore, the knowledge that respondents did possess, appeared to have been derived from the personal experience of working in noisy environments for many years, rather than from educational input. Contrary to expectations, respondents did not view deafness as a status symbol but rather as a negative attribute. Consequently, they were motivated to protect themselves from hearing impairment and to be educated about hearing and the effects of noise. The mine workers complained about discomfort when wearing hearing protective devices as well as feelings of insecurity due to inhibition of communication and the inability to hear warning signals. For these reasons, noise protection was mainly worn in situations perceived as noisy by workers themselves. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the clinical practice of audiology; hearing conservation in the mining industry; further research; and the training and education of speech-language pathologists and audiologists.

AB  - To investigate physiological and psychological effects of industrial noise, a survey was performed on 50 female workers exposed to machinery noise [93-100 dB(A)] (noise group) and 25 female workers in less-noisy environments [71-75 dB(A)] (control group) in a textile factory in Vietnam. Urine was collected for analysis of catecholamines and cortisol. The subjects were also asked to fill out a questionnaire. Each subject was examined over 2 working days. The workers in the noise group were asked to put earplugs in their ears during the working hours of the 2nd day. On the 1st day without earplugs, urinary excretion of catecholamines in the noise group were greater than those in the control group. Cortisol in urine showed a similar tendency. Differences in catecholamine excretion between the noise group and the control group decreased on the 2nd day when the earplugs were used for attenuation of noise level in the noise group. Frequency of subjective fatigue symptoms was lower on the 2nd day than that on the 1st day in the noise group, while the control group showed almost no day-difference. The results indicate that the catecholamine response to noise in workers was reduced through the use of earplugs.

AB  - The effect of oral Mg-supplementation as prophylaxis against noise-induced hearing loss was tested in a placebo-controlled double blind study involving 320 voluntary subjects during a 2-month period of military training. The hearing thresholds of all subjects were checked and only persons with normal hearing were accepted. Before and after the 2-month training, blood samples were collected and Mg was analysed in serum, erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Seven days after the last exposure to firearm noise, the audiograms of all test subjects were checked and permanent threshold shifts (PTS) were determined. The total group received a drink containing either 4g Mg granulate verum (6.7 mmol Mg aspartate) or placebo every working day during the 2-month training period. The primary source of noise exposure were firearms: 420 shots per person, mean peak level 164 dB(A). The recruits used ear plugs with a mean insertion loss of 25 dB. In both groups Mg-concentration in serum and in erythrocytes increased with time. Lymphocyte Mg increased in the Mg group only. In the placebo group the percentages of ears with PTS > 25 dB at 4 kHz/6 kHz and/or 8 kHz after exposure to firearm noise were twice as high as in the Mg group.

AB  - A computer-controlled fixed-frequency Bekesy audiometer has been used together with simplified mathematical models for hearing threshold measurements and analysis in 1796 subjects from seven different noise environments with exposures varying from < 80 dB(A) to > 95 dB(A). The methods of measurement and analysis have been used to determine hearing loss caused by noise for various age groups for men and women. It has also been possible to estimate the equivalent noise level to which workers are nowadays subjected under hearing protectors and the reduction in exposure level over the past 40 years. The results illustrate the effects of noise-reduction measures and the use of hearing protectors on the development of hearing loss suffered by workers in the actual Swedish industries.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Valuable recommendations for the choice, utilization, care, and maintenance, and for the measurement of sound attenuation of hearing-protective devices have been laid down in international standards. Yet, by considering the wearing time of a hearing protector, the standard DIN EN 458 assumes a scarcely understandable drastic reduction in the effective attenuation even when the device is not used for only a short time in a noise-filled area. A 30dB sound attenuation of such a protective device would, e.g., decrease to 12dB if it were unused for only 30min of an 8h shift. Thus, the actual influence of a shortened wearing time on the protection of earmuffs was tested in a laboratory study using audiometric measurements of the temporary threshold shift (TTS2) and its recovery after exposure to noise. For that purpose, the effectiveness of a hearing-protective device depending on the amount of time worn as prognosticated by DIN EN 458 was compared with the actual physiological effect of the earmuffs. Ten test subjects (Ss) participated in three test series (TS), each. In the first of the TS, the Ss were exposed to a sound pressure of 106dB(A) for 1h, during which the Ss wore noise-insulating earmuffs with an attenuation of 30dB. The Ss were exposed to the same sound pressure in TS II; however, after 30min, the earmuffs were removed for a duration of 334min. Mathematically, this reduced the sound attenuation of the earmuffs to 12dB, i.e., the average noise level over 1h is 94dB, which is equivalent to 85dB(A) over 8h. In order to evaluate the actual additional physiological cost of TS II, the Ss were exposed to 94dB(A)/1h without earmuffs in a third TS. This acoustic load, which is energy equivalent to the load in TS II, is also equivalent to 85dB(A)/8h. The results show that the continuous wearing of the earmuffs offers secure protection. However, the energetic approach and the levelling of differently structured noise loads according to the principle of energy equivalence leads to misconceiving results. The drastic reduction of the sound attenuation of the earmuffs predicted from the energetic point of view must be regarded as exaggerated. The TTS values show that TS II - which, according to the principle of energy-damage-equivalence, should result in the same effects as TS III - represents significantly less auditory fatigue. Thus, if the earmuffs are taken off briefly, a drastic reduction in the protection - as predicted in DIN EN 458 - does not result. Relevance to industry. The results of this study demonstrate that the standards and regulations for noise rating do not correspond with the actual physiological facts and, therefore, can only be used in a very limited manner. Utilization of the principle of energy equivalence has proven problematic not only for rating noise. This principle also leads to an essential underestimation of the attenuation of hearing protectors when these devices are taken off for only a short time in a noise-filled area.

AB  - The goal of the present paper was to investigate the relationship between hearing loss and noise exposure. Moreover, the author also examined the question whether damaging factors detected in the case history (hereditary susceptibility, toxic and infectious-toxic factors, cerebral and acoustic trauma, war, tinnitus) and working conditions (ototoxic industrial substances, shift work, hearing protection) affect hearing loss in any way. A tone and speech audiogram of 1020 persons exposed to industrial noise in a power station and non-exposed persons was evaluated for this purpose. In addition to exposure at the respective place of work, the sound intensity and total period of employment were also taken into consideration. The noise exposure of the persons working in industrial noise exceeded the limits of hearing damage, although it generally amounted to levels of less than 95 dB (A). Hearing loss in persons exposed to industrial noise increases as the noise level increases. In the intensities we examined, however, the level of sound appears to be less decisive in its effect than generally assumed. The effect of time on the threshold of hearing, on the other hand, is of importance at evaluation levels of less than 90 dB (A). In addition to age and occupational noise exposure, the following factors are significantly correlated to the threshold of hearing: hereditary susceptibility, traumata, war, tinnitus and shift work. On the whole, the factors and working conditions recorded in the case history have a considerable effect on hearing loss and are approximately equivalent to the noise at sound levels up to about 90 dB (A).

AB  - In this project we tested the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention (video, pamphlets, and guided practice session) to increase the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) among Midwestern construction workers and a national group of plumber/pipefitter trainers. Posttest measures were collected 10-12 months following this intervention. Pender's Health Promotion Model (1987) provided the conceptual basis for development of the training program. A total of 837 high-noise-exposed workers were included in the analysis: 652 regional Midwestern construction workers and 185 national plumber/pipefitter trainers. Effectiveness of the intervention was determined through the sequence of analyses recommended by Braver and Braver (1988) for the Solomon Four-Group Design. Analysis of variance and covariance of postintervention use and intention to use HPDs and a meta- analytic test were done. These analyses indicated that the intervention significantly increased use of HPDs but had no effect on intention to use HPDs in the future. Pretesting had no effect on use. Actual or potential applications of this research include guidance in the development of successful theory-based interventions to increase use of HPDs.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major occupational hazard. Occupational noise exposure threatens the hearing of many workers. In addition to noise exposure in the workplace, multiple factors affect individual susceptibility to NIHL. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with hearing loss in airport workers. A cross-sectional epidemiological design was used. Study subjects were 255 high noise-exposed full-time male workers at a large metropolitan airport in Korea. Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire, blood pressure measurement, audiological assessment, and a record review of baseline hearing and noise levels of locations where the employee worked. The result of multivariate analysis showed that both occupational noise exposure (noise exposure level, years of noise exposure) and personal risk factors including non-occupational noise exposure, history of ear disease, ototoxic drug use, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) were significantly associated with hearing loss. An aggressive hearing conservation program is needed at the airport, emphasizing both job-related noise exposure and personal risk factors for hearing loss.

AB  - The purposes of this study of airport workers were to a) determine the prevalence and symptoms of hearing loss, and b) identify compliance in using hearing protective devices (HPDs) and its relationship with hearing loss. This cross sectional epidemiological study was conducted with 255 noise exposed and 195 non-noise exposed, full time, male workers at a large metropolitan airport in Seoul, Korea. The three measures used were the self administered Occupational Hearing Questionnaire (OHQ), an audiological assessment, and a record review of baseline hearing and noise levels of locations in which the employee worked. The results showed a significant difference in prevalence of hearing loss (more than 25dB) between the noise and the non-noise exposed groups (p < .05). About 60.8% of noise exposed workers reported continuous use of the HPDs. The continuous HPD users had significantly lower rates of hearing loss than the occasional users or non- users. The major symptom for workers with low frequency hearing loss was trouble in communication, whereas tinnitus and fullness in the ear were the most common symptoms for the workers with high frequency hearing loss. The airport workers exposed to excessive noise had a great deal of high frequency hearing loss. The degree of hearing loss present reinforces the need for aggressive hearing conservation programs among airport workers exposed to noise.

AB  - In the spinning mill the observed noise reached the noise class N 92 to N 94; in the weaving factory it reached N 101 to N 104. In the spinning mill the affection of hearing in the workers was slight (maximum 22% by Fowler) and the third degree of disorder according to Quist Hanssen was observed in 13% of persons. In the weaving factory the 3rd degree of hearing disorder was observed in almost 30% of persons and 4.1% of them suffered from severe hearing loss (40-50% by Fowler). The use of glass wool Akuver in a small group of employees of the weaving factory proved to have a favorable effect on hearing preservation. The authors recommend the following preventive measures: audiological selection, preventive search, follow up examinations, re employment of persons sensitive to noise, individual hearing protection.

AB  - Exposure to intense levels of noise has been identified as a potential workplace risk for the development of hearing impairment for health care workers. With this knowledge a noise level survey was performed on selected orthopedic equipment. Several instruments produced threshold levels of 95 dBA to 106 dBA. Often these levels remained as high as 90 dBA at 4 ft from the source. Based on the results of this survey, audiometric tests were conducted on five cast technicians to determine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Audiometric measurements of the cast technicians indicated that, in the absence of other risk factors for hearing loss, there was an association between the presence of NIHL and the years of exposure. NIHL was most evident on the side of the dominant hand used for holding the cast cutter. These findings suggest there may be a risk of NIHL from the occupational exposure to various orthopedic instruments. Further, this level of risk may warrant the use of an individual hearing protection device or the development of quieter instruments.

AB  - This article describes findings from two separate convenience samples of popular musicians' health status, access to and use of health care, health habits, and related attitudes surveyed in 1996-1997. Sample 1 consisted of 111 musicians attending one of three regional music conferences (in Portland, OR, Austin, TX, or San Francisco, CA). The findings from sample 1 consist of demographics and music career-related information; current medical problems; nonmusculoskeletal (N-MS) and musculoskeletal (MS) problems that affected performance in the previous year; access to and use of health care; health habits related to alcohol, drug use, and smoking, use of hearing protection; and several health-related attitudes. Sample 2 consisted of 115 musicians surveyed in 1996 by mail from a random sample of a musicians' union list, by face-to-face interview during music club jobs in Dallas, Texas, or at a music conference in New Orleans, Louisiana. The findings from sample 2 are generally limited to N-MS and MS problems that affected performance in the previous year, health habits, and some health-related attitudes. Basic findings for sample 1 were as follows: 26% cited a current medical problem, 49% had at least one N-MS problem, 74% had at least one MS problem, and 42% reported hearing loss. In sample 2, 37% of the musicians reported hearing loss. Overall percentages for N-MS and MS problems for sample 2 were not available, but percentages for specific problems are delineated. Depression and anxiety were among the most frequently cited N-MS problems for both samples. Pain and stiffness were the most frequently reported MS problems for both samples. Ten percent of sample 1 musicians and 16% of sample 2 musicians indicated that alcohol or drug use had hurt their performance in the previous year. More than half of the musicians in sample 1 and sample 2 had health insurance, but most obtained it through non-music-related jobs or family coverage. Although the generalizability of the findings is limited significantly by the nonrandom nature of the samples and generally low response rates, this study nonetheless contributes provisional information on popular musicians' health status. The findings are compared with other musician samples where possible, including some previously unpublished health findings from the University of North Texas Musicians' Health Survey on the Internet. Specific concerns and strategies for future research on popular musicians' health status are suggested.

AB  - Workers at a soft drink production plant were interviewed about their hearing health, exposure to noise and use of occupational hearing protection devices. While 24% of the 209 workers reported always using hearing protection, 39% stated they never used any form of device. Worker responses were analysed and their stated reasons for the non use of hearing protection were summarised. Responses were compared to Australian and overseas industry findings. The need to conduct such survey research on an industry-by industry basis is emphasised and the implications for hearing conservation programs outlined.

AB  - Hearing thresholds of 2,667 white South African goldminers were determined in a cross-sectional survey. Median hearing thresholds at 1,000 Hz were comparable to those expected for men living in a developed society. For the frequencies 3,000 - 6,000 Hz, which are most affected by industrial noise, hearing thresholds were greater than expected and worsened with age relative to expected losses. The percentage of social impairment of hearing ranged from 0% in the youngest age group to 21,6% among those 58 years of age and over. Data from two surveys on the use of hearing protection indicate that it increased from 13,2% in 1979 to 17,2% in 1982. This level is probably still too low given the pervasiveness of noise in the goldmining industry. Some of the difficulties associated with a hearing conservation programme in the industry are discussed.

AB  - The use of a miniature microphone probe tube for sound-pressure level measurements in the outer earcanal was studied in four experiments. The main reason was to evaluate this method for clinical applications and for measurements of hearing protector attenuation. All measurements were registered in 1/3-oct bands. The dynamic range, frequency response of the microphone system, the insertion loss of the probe tube walls, and the influence of the probe tube in the ear canal on the sound-pressure level were examined. The first experiment attempted to determine an optimal placement of the probe tube in the earcanal. Sound-pressure levels resulting from a known free-field sound stimulus were measured at 12 different positions in the earcanal of human subjects. The results indicated that the position which is least sensitive for small movements of the probe tube on the measure was within 1 to 3 mm of the tympanic membrane. In a second experiment the changes in sound transfer function to the tympanic membrane caused by the microphone itself, when positioned just outside the ear canal entrance, were studied for 72 angles of sound incidences in ten subjects. A few minor but significant changes were observed with the microphone in this position. In a third experiment, sound transfer functions were measured from free sound field to the tympanic membrane in 19 subjects. The measurements were performed in 1/3- oct frequency bands (0.2 to 20 kHz) with sound incidences from 24 azimuthal positions and for each of these, three different elevations. The inter- and intrasubject-variability are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the reliability of probe tube microphone measurements was evaluated by repeated measurements of the sound transfer function, five times in ten subjects with the sound incidence from one position. The results indicated very small variations between repeated measurements.

AB  - A 35-year-old toolmaker developed an allergic contact dermatitis of the hands and face after frequent handling of foam material dyed with different disperse dyestuffs. Strongest reactions were obtained with a red foam material used to restrain vibrations of sensitive machine parts. A hypersensitivity to p-phenylenediamine and p-toluenediamine had been acquired already in previous jobs. A severe relapse occurred when wearing the headphones of a portable stereo casette player (walkman) equipped with red foam material as an ear protection. The responsible azo dyestuff could be identified as Disperse Orange 3. This is already a known sensitiser in tights (panty hose) and other textiles.

AB  - The sources of human exposure to low-frequency noise and its effects are reviewed. Low-frequency noise is common as background noise in urban environments, and as an emission from many artificial sources: road vehicles, aircraft, industrial machinery, artillery and mining explosions, and air movement machinery including wind turbines, compressors, and ventilation or air-conditioning units. The effects of low-frequency noise are of particular concern because of its pervasiveness due to numerous sources, efficient propagation, and reduced efficacy of many structures (dwellings, walls, and hearing protection) in attenuating low-frequency noise compared with other noise. Intense low-frequency noise appears to produce clear symptoms including respiratory impairment and aural pain. Although the effects of lower intensities of low-frequency noise are difficult to establish for methodological reasons, evidence suggests that a number of adverse effects of noise in general arise from exposure to low-frequency noise: Loudness judgments and annoyance reactions are sometimes reported to be greater for low-frequency noise than other noises for equal sound-pressure level; annoyance is exacerbated by rattle or vibration induced by low-frequency noise; speech intelligibility may be reduced more by low-frequency noise than other noises except those in the frequency range of speech itself, because of the upward spread of masking. On the other hand, it is also possible that low-frequency noise provides some protection against the effects of simultaneous higher frequency noise on hearing. Research needs and policy decisions, based on what is currently known, are considered.

AB  - In industrial workplaces, it is widely believed that the use of hearing protectors interferes with communication and with the perception of warning signals. The objective of this study was to estimate effects of attenuation of the protectors on speech perception in noise. In the experiment, the intelligibility of monosyllables was assessed for ten normal-hearing adults, using three types of protectors with different attenuation characteristics. The speech materials were presented at two speech levels (65 and 85 dBA) in noise. The noise level was altered at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of 0, +5, and +10 dB. The results showed that speech intelligibility was significantly influenced by type of protector, speech level, and SNR. The interaction between these factors was statistically significant. The wearing of the earplug with decreased low-frequency attenuation resulted in less deterioration when the speech was presented at 65 dBA. On the other hand, such an earplug did not improve speech intelligibly as compared with other protectors when the speech was presented at 85 dBA. Therefore, the use of the protectors with decreased attenuation to improve speech communication for workers wearing protectors needs to be re-examined. Relevance to industry. Since the wearing of hearing protectors interferes with speech perception, industrial workers hesitate to wear the protectors. Therefore, hearing protectors need to be redesigned to improve speech communication.

AB  - During the past several years, methods of field testing have been developed and used to study the effectiveness of personal ear protection worn by employees working in hazardous noise levels. Similar methods were utilized to determine the effectiveness of earplugs being worn by employees of a company and to improve the protection of all employees to safe levels. The results of the study indicate that the method used may be a cost effective means of reducing noise exposure to safe levels.

AB  - In the official statistics the usefulness of occupational-medical health check-ups is not adequately reflected. Evaluation of the data from general occupational-medical health check-ups reveals which consultations and recommendations regarding the health and behaviour of the employees are at all possible as part of works medical examination and which contribution occupational-medical health check-ups provide towards the prevention of disease. At the occupational-medical services of the German Employer's Liability Insurance Associations for the construction industry computerised documentation is available on the findings and the results of consultations from general occupational-medical health check-ups offered as a voluntary service to determine overall health and taken up by the majority of the employees. Data are available on 72 008 male employees from the years 1993 to 1997. At least one recommendation was given by the works physician to 84% of the < 40-year-olds and 96% of the older construction workers. The individual recommendations are related to medical findings: ear protection (22%) with a markedly increasing tendency with age, skin protection (5%), knee protection (1%). Changes in lifestyle due to individual risk profiles are recommended such as weight reduction/dietary changes (20%), blood pressure monitoring (12%), stopping smoking (10%), physical conditioning (9%) and avoidance of alcohol (3%). The recommended weight reduction is aimed mainly at employees with a sedentary job (28% of the construction machine operators, 27% of the architects and managers). 30% are recommended to first pay a visit to their GP, among these 13% of the < 20-year-olds, but 43% of the least 50-years- olds. Further recommendations are to see the ophthalmologist (11%), the orthopaedic physician (6%), the dentist (6%), the ears, nose and throat physician (4%) and the dermatologist (4%). The participation of men in works medical check-ups is considerably greater than in the Check-up 35 programme offered by the health insurance institutions. The chances for effective prevention of disease increase as the result of determining the individual risk and by linking it to the long-term occupational perspective. Health check-ups by works physicians are not in competition with the GPs as about a third of the employees are recommended to pay a visit to their GP. Occupational-medical disease prevention should in future not be considered in isolation, but as a part of population-related disease prevention. The interdisciplinary determination and evaluation of occupational-medical health check-ups, a continuously up-to-date preventive diagnostic concept and the transparent representation of the results, due to the social and economic dimension belong to the requirements of future works medical care.

AB  - Conductive hearing loss attenuates and delays sound passing through the middle ear. This impairs binaural hearing and other central auditory functions dependent on high fidelity sound transmission. Persistent conductive loss leads to central impairments that persist after the peripheral loss has resolved. For example, children who have had multiple episodes of otitis media with effusion (OME) in the first few years of life may have poor detection of sounds in noisy environments, evidenced by reduced binaural unmasking (BU). Recent research shows that a 'threshold' level of OME is required to produce impaired BU. Children who had OME in one or both ears for more than about 50% of the first 5 years had reduced BU. Animal research, using long-term ear plugging, suggests that total OME duration, rather than age at the time of having the disease, determines its effect on BU. Animals reared with bilateral (but not unilateral) ear plugs also have poor auditory temporal resolution, and reduced sensitivity to short tones in the presence of background noise, after plug removal. However, given time (6-24 months) and training, all animals regained normal temporal resolution. © 2003 British Association for Paediatric Otorhinolaryngology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss has previously been reported among rock musicians. This study sought to determine whether a hazard of noise-induced hearing loss exists for music club employees other than musicians themselves. Sound levels at eight live-music clubs were measured and symptoms of noise exposure in 31 music club employees were assessed by questionnaire. The average sound level at the various clubs during performances ranged from 94.9 to 106.7 dBA. The overall sound level average, including both performance and ambient levels, ranged from 91.9 to 99.8 dBA. Symptoms of noise exposure, such as tinnitus and subjective hearing loss, correlated with sound intensity. Only 16% reported regular use of hearing protection. We conclude that employees of music clubs are at substantial risk of developing Noise- Induced Hearing Loss, due to chronic noise exposure which consistently exceeded safe levels. Hearing protection is used much too infrequently. The development of hearing conservation programs for this large group of workers is essential.

AB  - This is the first round in a series of surveys conducted in Fort McMurray as part of the Fort McMurray Demonstration Project in social marketing. This component of the survey was intended to focus on the most prominent group of employed workers in the community and to compare their patterns of response with the community as a whole. Respondents to the survey were overwhelmingly male (96%), married (72.9%) and living in households of two to five persons (87.9%). They were predominantly aged 30-44 (55%) and graduates of high school (53.5%). Younger male workers (below age 30) were more likely to have a high school diploma (78.3%) or some additional technical or vocational training (21.7% compared to 12.5% overall) and to be unmarried or separated. Attitudes toward safety-related behaviours were stronger than for respondents from the community as a whole. Approximately 70-100% of all age groups and both sexes showed strong agreement with attitudes involving child car seats and the unacceptability of drinking and driving. These attitudes include strong advocacy of vigorous enforcement of occupational health and safety standards. However, they showed a variability similar to the community as a whole in behaviour at home compared to work, generally reporting more consistent use of personal protection on the job than in their own homes, particularly hearing protection. Even so, they were much less likely to perform stretching and warm-up exercises prior to exertion than community residents in general. The potential may exist to transfer the technology and attitudes from workplace health and safety to community safety. One possible strategy to accomplish this is to involve workers in this industry directly in community initiatives. This strategy may be generalizable to any community in which there are major employers who place a heavy emphasis on risk control and occupational health and safety.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was the determination of the physiological hearing threshold from 10-20 kHz with regard to age differences. The source of the testing signal was an 1/2 inch condenser microphone type 4133 joined with a beat frequency oscillator type 1022 of Bruel and Kjaer production. The signal was conducted into the external ear canal using a microphone probe type UA0040, which was incorporated into the board of a hearing protector. The study included 168 subjects, non - noise exposed and without otorhinolaryngological abnormalities, in the following age groups: 17-20 yr, 21-30 yr, 31-40 yr and 41-50 yr. It has been stated that the obtained threshold data show in the frequency range 10-13 kHz, a slope of 15 dB/octave, and in the range 14-20 kHz, a slope of 100 dB/octave. The hearing threshold level in the range from 10-20 kHz represents the function of age. In the range 10-13kHz the effect of aging is at average 1 dB/yr, in the range 14-20 kHz 2 dB/yr.

Much progress has been made toward applying ANC to narrow-band, low-frequency noise in confined spaces. During this same period, the application of ANC to broad-band noise or noise in three-dimensional spaces has seen little progress because of the recent quantification of serious physical limitations, most importantly, noncausality, stability, spatial mismatch, and the infinite gain controller requirement. ANC employs superposition to induce destructive interference to affect the attenuation of noise. ANC was believed to utilize the mechanism of phase cancellation to achieve the desired attenuation. However, current literature points to other mechanisms that may be operating in ANC. Categories of ANC are one-dimensional field and duct noise, enclosed spaces and interior noise, noise in three-dimensional spaces, and personal hearing protection. Development of active noise control stems from potential advantages in cost, size, and effectiveness. There are two approaches to ANC. In the first, the original sound is processed and injected back into the soundfield in antiphase. The second approach is to synthesize a cancelling waveform. ANC of turbulent flow in pipes and ducts is the largest area in the field. Much work into the actual mechanism involved and the causal versus noncausal aspects of system controllers has been done. Fan and propeller noise can be divided into two categories: noise generated directly as the blade passing tones and noise generated as a result of blade tip turbulence inducing vibration in structures. Three-dimensional spaces present a noise environment where physical limitations are magnified and the infinite gain controller requirement is confronted. Personal hearing protection has been shown to be best suited to the control of periodic, low-frequency noise.

AB  - Background: Data from the telephone interview portion of the New York Farm Family Health and Hazard Surveillance were used to study self-reported hearing loss in New York farmers. Method(s): One thousand six hundred and twenty-two persons completed the hearing loss and noise exposure interview. Hearing loss was defined as at least some trouble hearing in one or both ears. Predictors of hearing loss were determined using logistic regression. Result(s): Twenty-two percent of participants reported hearing loss. From the logistic regression, significant confounders are age (P = 0.0001), gender (P = 0.0001), being from a livestock farm (P = 0.012), and loss of consciousness due to head trauma (P = 0.04). Significant noise exposures are more hours of lifetime exposure to noisy farm equipment (P = 0.001) and having had a noisy non-farm job (with some hearing protection P = 0.002, without any hearing protection P = 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Farm noise exposure is a serious risk to the hearing of this population. Although use of hearing protection should be encouraged, replacing and modifying farm equipment to decrease noise at the source should be the first priority. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Hearing conservation programs, when appropriate in industry, are now a necessity. Even though one may not wish to adopt an altruistic attitude toward the conservation of hearing, one must, like it or not, initiate a hearing conservation program because of both federal and state regulations. Since industrial noise exposure produces more hearing loss in more people than all other causes of hearing loss combined, it is incumbent on all industries with noise makers to do something about protecting human hearing. The tragedy is that nearly all industrial hearing loss can be prevented with proper hearing conservation measures. The cost of hearing conservation is far less than the cost of hearing loss in terms of human suffering and dollars in the compensation courts. Proper education of both management and labor can result in successful hearing conservation programs. The method of choice is reduction of the noise at the source, but in many cases this is infeasible both technically and economically and therefore protection at the ear must be used. Experience has shown that with proper supervision ear protection programs can prevent the majority of instances of hearing loss in the majority of individuals exposed.

AB  - Studies evaluated muff-type hearing protection devices (HPDs) in a mining environment. Noise reduction measurements were made using miniature microphones inside and outside the HPD cup. Laboratory tests conducted prior to field evaluations indicated that the results of this physical method were similar to the results of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) real ear attenuation at threshold method. A total of 23 models of HPDs and 545 machines (20 different machine types) were evaluated in the field phase, resulting in 1265 HPD evaluations. The effectiveness of each HPD model in terms of dBA noise reduction is presented as a function of the metric (C-A), which characterizes the spectrum of the machine noise. The dBA reductions for various combinations of HPD models and machine types are also presented. The results show that the field performance of muff-type HPDs is significantly less than that specified by the Environmental Protection Agency Noise Reduction Rating (NRR), especially for low-frequency noise sources such as internal combustion engines. Thirty-two percent of the operators of such machines observed noise reductions of 10 dBA or less. Across all machine types, 20% of the workers realized an observed noise reduction of 10 dBA or less. It is concluded that the NRR grossly overestimates HPD performance. In addition, the NRR is not a good indicator for comparing HPD models since in many instances HPDs with lower NRRs outperformed those with higher NRRs. The laboratory-derived NRRs' failure to predict the HPD field performance was related primarily to the inaccuracy of the basic laboratory attenuation data from which the NRRs were computed, and to a lesser extent to shortcomings in the NRR computational procedure.

AB  - Hearing conservation audiometry reports received at the USAF Hearing Conservation Data Registry from January through June 1975 were grouped according to the Air Force Specialty Code, job description, shown for the individual. The 48,271 records surveyed included 46 job codes with 50 or more reports and 47 with fewer than 50. There were 5,298 records with no identifiable job code. The percentage of significant threshold shift was calculated for each record, with the total group revealing 23.21%. The percent significant threshold shift for each job code with 50 or more was calculated so that each could be compared to the average for the entire group. Special attention should be given to all of these job categories to try to eliminate any unnecessary noise exposure. For some jobs the medical monitors will have problems pinpointing the source of the threshold shift. For example, persons in job code 14 are pilots who are older than pilots in codes 10, 11, 12, and 13. The older pilots are now in more management related duties. Their threshold shift could be due either to previous noise exposure or to current excessive exposure secondary to more work on the flight line. Efforts to reduce the incidence of significant threshold shift need to be accelerated for these older people, and age alone should not be accepted as the causative factor. AFSC 59 (marine) and 75 (education and training) jobs both show excessive threshold shift (64.71% and 50%). Although both job groups are small (17 and 82 reports respectively), each warrants special attention. The education and training group is probably made up of small arms instructors with frequent exposure to impulse (or impact) type noise, and the marine group is probably exposed to frequent engine noise. In any case, both groups should be afforded extra attention in the fitting of ear protection and indoctrination in its use.

AB  - The influence of the fitter on attenuation, provided by custom molded earpulgs, shows that manufacturers' data cannot be reliably used to predict the amount of protection that a set of these hearing protectors might provide a given user. The authors feel it is reasonable to believe that the problems found with the brand of custom earplugs they examined would apply equally to other types of individually molded earplugs. They have reservations about the unqualified acceptance of mean data in predicting the effectiveness of these devices. The potential for substantial individual differences must be kept in mind when considering the use of custom earplugs in industrial hearing conservation. They recommend that employees using these earplugs be scheduled for monitoring audiometry at least annually. In addition, they should be instructed to report any evidence of tinnitus or any other subjective impressions that their earplugs may not be effective, and an immediate switch to another type of protector is suggested if this condition is reported.

AB  - The attenuation provided by TDH earphones in MX-41/AR and P/N 51 cushions, Audiocup earphone enclosures and ER-3A insert earphones with ER3-14 foam earplugs was determined for 30 normally hearing subjects using a real-ear attenuation at threshold paradigm. The MX-41/AR and P/N 51 cushions provided about the same amount of attenuation which was less than the attenuation provided by the Audiocup enclosures. The ER-3A/ER3-14 provided the highest amount of attenuation. The MX-41/AR and ER-3A/ER3-14 attenuation values were in agreement with other studies using similar methodology. However, the attenuation provided by the Audiocup enclosures was considerably less, in the lower frequencies, than reported in two other studies. ANSI S3.1-1977 supra-aural earphone cushion attenuation values, which were determined using pure-tones presented in a free-field, should be replaced by earphone cushion attenuation values determined with 1/3 octave bands of noise presented in a diffuse sound field.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the attenuation characteristics of several hearing aid earmolds. Six earmolds and an E-A-R earplug modified to act as an earmold were evaluated according to the standard procedure. The six earmolds consisted of two types (shell and skeleton) having different materials (Lucite and vinylflex) and different styles (normal and tragus lock). The traditional earmolds provided approximately 17 dB less attenuation as compared with the E-A-R earmolds. The attenuation provided by the traditional earmolds was not influenced by the type, material, or style. The traditional earmolds had a noise reduction rating of less than 3.3 dB., whereas the noise reduction rating for the E-A-R earmolds was greater than 18.2 dB. Traditional earmolds should not be considered as a substitute for a hearing protection device. However, E-A-R earmolds could be used as a substitute for a hearing protection device provided the level of the noise minus the noise reduction rating would be acceptable.

AB  - The term medicolegal refers to the relationship between medicine and the law. Hearing loss resulting from occupational noise exposure presents legal as well as medical problems. Questions of causal relationship and the extent and degree of the hearing impairment arise from a medical standpoint, whereas questions as to the compensability and amount of compensation to be awarded arise from the law. An understanding of the nature and extent of these problems should be preceded by some knowledge of the purpose, origin, development, and present day status of workers' compensation legislation. These laws are designed to compensate an employee for an injury or disease arising out of and in the course of employment. In the present paper an overview is given of the development of workers' compensation laws in the United States, the physicians' medicolegal role, development of damage risk criteria for hearing, ear protection, baseline and periodic audiograms, employment of applicants with a hearing loss, etc.

AB  - In the Army, as in civil industry, there are many noise sources where the noise can not be reduced to safe levels except by use of hearing protectors, such as ear plugs, ear muffs or noise-excluding helmets. This paper shows how the effectiveness of hearing protectors can be determined for both continuous and impulse (gunfire) noise. It is shown that the results are in most cases in agreement with results for the real-ear attenuation at threshold method; the reasons for the exceptions are discussed. Hearing protection is often unpopular with users; reasons for this include discomfort, difficulty in speech communication, and incompatibility with other headgear. The degree of protection in practical usage is often much less than that measured in the laboratory. Possible solutions to these problems are described.

AB  - Hearing loss in the aviation environment has been attributed to a variety of factors ranging from aircraft noise exposure to the aging process. Consequently, this study was conducted to determine the relative contribution of age, total flight hours, type of aircraft, and use of hearing protection to hearing loss in U.S. Army aviators. Information from a survey of the aviators in an aviation brigade was combined with audiometic records to create the data file. The final study group, 83% of the unit aviators, was evaluated for hearing loss using two criteria: 1) existing U.S. army standards, and 2) four empirical categories of significant threshold shift. Data analysis suggests that hearing loss is primarily a function of noise exposure as measured by total flight hours. Age was found to be a less significant factor; aircraft type had no significant effect. The results indicate that combination hearing protection appears to significantly lower the risk of hearing loss.

AB  - Because interstitial lung disease increases the work of breathing, the aim of this study was to determine if this condition is associated with increased energy requirements. A group of 12 clinically stable patients with interstitial lung disease was studied. Patients with a history of weight loss had significantly more severe lung volume restriction. Regression analysis showed that 42% of body weight variation was explained by vital capacity (p<0.025). Resting energy expenditure was measured by standard methods of indirect calorimetry. The measurements were performed with a ventilated hood during prolonged steady-state periods after an overnight fast. We found that resting energy expenditure was increased to 117.3 and 118.7% of the predicted basal metabolic rate, according to Fleisch and to Harris and Benedict reference values, respectively (p<0.001). Furthermore, resting energy expenditure was increased to 120.8% of the predicted value according to body fat-free mass (p<0.001). This extra energy expenditure in patients with interstitial lung disease is similar to that recently reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - Farmers are known to be exposed to intermittent intense noise from a variety of sources, but long-term exposure and the resulting risk of hearing loss have not been well characterized. We studied a cross-sectional random sample of farms on which agricultural workers completed an audiometric test and questionnaire, and performed noise dosimetry on a subsample. Sixty-five percent of farms and a total of 586 workers participated. Noise on the subsample of 60 farms lay in a range between 84.8 to 86.8 dB(A) and hearing losses were consistent with this level of exposure. Age, driving tractors without cabs, and working with metal were important risk factors. Reported compliance with hearing protection was higher than that actually observed. The majority of farmers have a moderate risk of hearing loss, but a significant minority is at high risk. Elimination and isolation of noise sources are the control methods of choice, and if residual hearing protection is required, compliance must be improved.

AB  - Background: Investigating cases of noise induced hearing loss the expert is often confronted with the situation that the hearing loss is progressive although the noise exposure has been reduced to almost non-damaging levels. Other causes such as age, hereditary deafness, head injuries, blasts, internal diseases can be excluded. Hearing aids as sources of damaging noise? By consulting the protocol of the hearing-aid acoustician and by own examinations the expert should obtain the following data: loudness level that yields best discrimination score of speech; level of discomfort for tones and speech, discrimination score that is achieved under free field condition with a speech level of 65 dB, using the hearing aids. Furthermore he should explore the circumstances under which the hearing aids are used: how many hours per day, at what occasions etc.? Interpretation: It is likely that in using the hearing aids they are adjusted to emit an intensity level identical to the one yielding the optimal discrimination score. If this e.g. is 100 dB and the hearing aids are used for 2 hours per day this would be equivalent to an exposure to industrial noise of 94 dB (A) for 8 hours daily without ear protection. Discussion(s): Among all individuals working under industrial noise exposure today only about 1 - 2 % having unusually vulnerable inner ears will suffer a noise induced hearing loss. On the other hand workers in industrial noise are accustomed to loud noise levels, usually have a raised threshold of discomfort and therefore are likely to adjust their hearing aids to such high intensities. The expert will have to decide whether in an individual case the industrial noise exposure or the use of the hearing aids is the dominant risk for further damage. The consequences in respect to the regulations of the workers' health insurance are discussed.

AB  - The noise generated by stimulating coils may jeopardize the hearing of the patients as well as the hearing of the examiner. To evaluate the potential risk caused by the impulse noise of stimulating coils, we examined the A-weighted peak sound pressure levels from five different types of magnetic stimulator coils. At a distance of 10 cm, with 100% stimulation intensity, the coils with Dantec and Magstim stimulators created maximum peak sound pressure levels of 110 dB. Correspondingly, Cadwell MES-10 created maximum peak sound pressure levels of 132 dB. The decrease in the peak levels followed the distance rule quite closely. At a distance of 40 cm, the decrease in peak level was on average 14 dB (range -1-+1 dB). Based on American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limits of impact noise, the permitted maximum daily number of magnetic stimuli would be 1000 to 10000. The permitted number of daily stimuli may be difficult to exceed in clinical practice. We consider the risk as small for the patients that are being examined and the operator using magnetic stimulation. The potential risk can be further diminished by even very light weighted hearing protectors providing proper attenuation to the coil impulses.

AB  - Noise abatement alternatives in designing facilities are essential to insure a quality environment in the workplace and community. While considerable effort is presently being expended to abate noise at existing facilities, the greatest potential for noise abatement lies in the area of designing new facilities. Proper consideration in preliminary design will result in the most cost-effective measures for reducing noise. In the past few years there has been an increasing awareness of the effects of noise, both in the occupational and the community environment. The demand for quieter facilities, from the large industrial or energy park to the small pumping station, has increased significantly in the last few years, and will increase more in the future. Firms engaged in designing new facilities have a responsibility to meet this demand. In designing a new facility, there are two basic areas of concern: the occupational environment where the primary concern is hearing protection, and the community environment where the primary concern is preventing annoyance. Both these areas have the potential of creating a severe economic impact on the operations of a facility. Equal attention should be given to these two areas in the design of a new facility. The first step in designing a new facility is to select design goals for the occupational and community noise environments. The second step is to review the conceptual design of the proposed facility with architects and engineers for the purpose of obtaining: The location and installation details of all major sources of noise; the location of all noise sensitive areas; and, the possible paths by which noise will propagate to each noise sensitive area. The third step is to predict noise levels at each sensitive location. Predictions are made using the familiar source-path-receiver model. The noise level at each sensitive location is the sum of the contributions from each source via each path. Engineering judgement is required to identify only those sources and paths that are dominant or else the calculation becomes unmanageable. Comparison of projected noise levels with the design goals will indicate, if necessary, the degree of noise abatement required. Once noise level predictions are made, the noise reduction potential of various abatement measures can be calculated. The relative merit of each abatement measure will be determined by the selected design goals.

AB  - To determine the effectiveness of insert-type hearing protectors (earplugs) as they are worn in the workplace, an audiometric van specially instrumented to determine the real-ear noise attenuation of earplugs was taken to six industrial sites where a total of 840 attenuation tests were made among 168 workers. Results indicate, that, on the average, workers were receiving noise protection ranging from a minimum of about 6 dB at 125 Hz to a maximum of approximately 20dB at 3150 Hz (test frequency range was 125 to 8000 Hz). Comparison of these results to corresponding data established in the laboratory, and reported by the earplug manufacturers, showed that the average worker tested was receiving only 33 to 54% of the potential attenuation of the hearing protectors. Additional special testing demonstrated that this reduced performance probably was due to the workers using the wrong size earplugs for their ear canals and/or improperly inserting the earplugs.

AB  - Introduction. Consistent use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) decreases noise-induced hearing loss, however, many workers do not use them consistently. Past research has supported the need to use a conceptual framework to understand behaviors and guide intervention programs; however, few reports have specified a process to translate a conceptual model into an intervention. Purpose. The strongest predictors from the Health Promotion Model were used to design a training program to increase HPD use among construction workers. Subjects/Setting. Carpenters (n = 118), operating engineers (n = 109), and plumber/pipefitters (n = 129) in the Midwest were recruited to participate in the study. Design. Written questionnaires including scales measuring the components of the Health Promotion Model were completed in classroom settings at worker trade group meetings. Measures. All items from scales predicting HPD use were reviewed to determine the basis for the content of a program to promote the use of HPDs. Three selection criteria were developed; (1) correlation with use of hearing protection (at least .20), (2) amenability to change, and (3) room for improvement (mean score not at ceiling). Results. Linear regression and Pearson's correlation were used to assess the components of the model as predictors of HPD use. Five predictors had statistically significant regression coefficients: perceived noise exposure, self-efficacy, value of use, barriers to use, and modeling of use of hearing protection. Using items meeting the selection criteria, a 20- minute videotape with written handouts was developed as the core of an intervention. A clearly defined practice session was also incorporated in the training intervention. Conclusion. Determining salient factors for worker populations and specific protective equipment prior to designing an intervention is essential. These predictors provided the basis for a training program that addressed the specific needs for construction workers. Results of tests of the effectiveness of the program will be available in the near future.

AB  - Tailoring of health-related messages is effective in motivating behavior change. However, planning, designing, and implementing a tailored health promotion program can be a challenge. This article describes the process of creating a tailored multimedia program for presentation via computer to promote factory workers' use of hearing-protection devices to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. The creation process was segmented into 5 phases: 1) determination of program content; 2) creation of overall program design, including live action and still video and addition of sound and graphics; 3) development and integration of tailoring pathways into the final intervention; 4) development of a database and participant handouts; and 5) pilot testing of the intervention program. The approach used in this research program can serve as a prototype for future development of computerized multimedia health promotion interventions and can assist others in the effective use of this medium.

AB  - A new procedure for determining the attenuation of earplugs with a standard audiometric headset was evaluated. The procedure utilized a device that supports a conventional supraaural earphone cushion (MX-41/AR) such that it does not contact the pinna or the earplug during threshold measurement. The attenuation provided by a foam earplug was estimated on a group of normal-hearing subjects using this method. The resulting attenuation values were compared to data obtained using sound field (ANSI SI2.6-1984) methods, and to values obtained by simply placing the earphone on the pinna. Results suggest that the test re-test reliabilities of both the earphone-support method and the earphone-only method were comparable to that of the sound field procedure. Also, of the four test frequencies employed (1, 2, 3 and 4 kHz), the closest correspondence between attenuation estimates obtained using the ANSI procedures and estimates obtained with the support device occurred at 1 and 2 kHz.

AB  - Exposure to impulse noise is an important occupational health concern. The risk of injury to auditory structures is well recognized and provides the cornerstone for present safety standards. For freefield impulse noise, nonauditory injury is dependent on peak pressure, positive phase duration (or impulse), and number of exposures. Trivial laryngeal petechiae are shown to precede nonauditory injury to more critical organs (ie, pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems). This study identifies the critical impulse noise thresholds causing trivial laryngeal petechial changes resulting from exposure to 5, 25, and 100 repetitions of specific levels of impulse noise. Because of anatomical differences, sheep should be slightly more susceptible to impulse noise laryngeal petechial changes than man; therefore, it seems reasonable to set the absolute limits for human occupational exposure levels below those causing laryngeal petechiae in sheep for persons wearing adequate hearing protection. This study does not address human auditory injury that may occur above or below these exposure limits even with proper hearing protection.

AB  - The Hearing Conservation Amendment published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1983 requires hearing conservation programs to be provided for over 5 million workers whose daily noise exposures exceed 85 dBA time-weighted average. The permissible exposure level is 90 dBA, above which the use of hearing protectors is mandatory. Current policies rely heavily on periodic audiometry to detect early threshold shifts due to inadequate use of hearing protection or to individual variation in susceptibility to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). Studies including over 1,000 noise exposed workers have shown that audiometry in the industrial setting is less reliable than clinical audiometry. Pure tone averaging markedly reduces test-retest variability and should be incorporated into rules for decision-making based on industrial audiometry. However, at least half of observed shifts are spurious. In addition, aging is an important confounding variable; in our data, about half of the population mean threshold shift seen was attributable to aging. Thus, only a minority of threshold shifts seen in industrial audiometry are due to NIHL. The large number of 'false positive' shifts will inevitably eventually have the effect of a de facto lowering of the permissible exposure level to 85 dBA. Otologic referral and major administrative action should be reserved for large or repeated threshold shifts. OSHA does not specify rules for otologic referral, but the criteria recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery are reasonable and should be supported. The necessity for otlogic evaluation in the differential diagnosis of NIHL from other entities (particularly baseline audiometric abnormalities) is not universally appreciated; otolaryngologists need to educate their medical and non-medical colleagues about this.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Hearing conservation in industry relies heavily on monitoring audiometry to detect early noise-induced loss in workers who are exposed to potentially damaging noise, with or without hearing protectors. The 'real-world' reliability and validity of these measurements, as well as otoscopic observations in industry, have not been extensively investigated. In addition, there is considerable controversy over the selection of a definition of 'significant threshold shift' in industrial audiometry. These and related issues were considered in a series of three studies utilizing data from an active hearing conservation program. Test-retest variability in industry is much higher than has been reported for clinical settings; this variability is reduced by pure-tone averaging. Workers referred for otologic evaluation were found to have hearing levels which were, on the average, about 5 dB better than indicated by plant audiometry, even without excluding 4% of referred workers who had unilateral deafness and showed 'shadow curves' on the plant audiograms. Otoscopic data obtained by the plant audiometrists were uncorrelated with the results of otoscopy by consultant otologists. Techniques borrowed from decision theory and signal detection theory were used to evaluate possible criteria for significant threshold shift. Criteria based on pure-tone averaging were superior to those based on a certain amount of threshold shift for any frequency tested. It is proposed that a significant threshold shift be defined as a 10 dB or greater change for the worse for either the 0.5, 1, 2 kHz puretone average or the 3, 4, 6 kHz pure-tone average, in either ear, and that such shifts be validated by prompt retesting. Even with this criterion, a substantial number of shifts (most shifts, in some situations) will be either spurious or attributable to disorders other than noise-induced hearing loss, such as presbycusis. Otologic referral in cases of large or repeated shifts may prevent unjustified administrative actions, to the advantage of both workers and management. A practical consequence of the use of monitoring audiometry may be a de facto lowering of the permissible exposure level to 85 dBA TWA.

AB  - In order to be able to evaluate real noise exposure in the pilot's ear, measurements of noise levels, level-time analyses for various flight regimens were done, and level-frequency spectrums were determined. From this permanent noise level L(eq) is calculated. Pilots wear radio listening aids which serve as sound control for the ears. From 5 different radio listening aids the objective sound control measure is determined within the free sound field. Taking into consideration these values, real sound exposure was found in the pilot's ear. Thus, it could be ascertained, that only when Hermetos-radio listening capsule is used, is sufficient hearing protection according to TGL 10 687 (German standard) provided.

AB  - Acoustic noise levels for fast MRI pulse sequences were surveyed on 14 systems with field strengths ranging from 0.2 T to 3 T. A microphone insensitive to the magnetic environment was placed close to the magnet isocenter and connected via an extension cable to a sound level meter outside the scan room. Measured noise levels varied from 82.5 +/- 0.1 dB(A) for a 0.23 T system to 118.4 +/- 1.3 dB(A) for a 3 T system. Further measurements on four of the closed-bore systems surveyed showed that: 1) pulse sequence parameters (particularly FOV and TR) were more influential in determining noise level than field strength, 2) the noise level was found to vary along the z-direction with a maximum near the bore entrance, and 3) in one of two systems tested there was a significant increase in noise with a volunteer present instead of a test object. The results underline the importance of hearing protection for patients and for staff spending extended periods in the scan room. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:288-293. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The aim of this study was to document hazard exposure among farmers and farm workers in Victoria. Data on operational tractors, exposure to other farm machinery, personal protective equipment and current safety practices were collected in a telephone survey of 153 farmers. Ninety-two per cent of eligible respondents contacted participated in the survey. Of the 304 tractors, 76.4% had roll-over protective structures and 80% had power takeoff guards. Among properties using agbikes and horses, helmet ownership was 72.4% and 77.1% respectively. Among properties with hearing protection, 43% reported using it in all or almost all instances of driving an uncabined tractor. Eight respondents reported having conducted safety checks, five of whom subsequently made safety-related changes. Promotion of farm safety checks would therefore seem to be an appropriate prevention strategy. This study was not able to determine whether any other strategies are effective in inducing safety-related environmental changes, or which factors motivate farmers to conduct safety checks. The small sample surveyed differed in age and sex from the Victorian farm labour force, and on property size when compared with all farms in Victoria. A larger, more representative survey is required to validate these findings.

AB  - Although hearing protectors have been available for more than 60 years, little field surveillance has been done to assess their appropriate wear in noisy occupational environments. This study examined historical field survey data to determine whether workers use hearing protection when exposed to loud noise. Data from the 1981-83 NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey were analyzed to determine whether workers in noise greater than or equal to 85 dBA were using hearing protection. The study also looked at the effect of company personal protective equipment (PPE) policies on hearing protector compliance. This study found that, in 1981-83, an estimated 4.1 million industrial workers were exposed to noise greater than or equal to 85 dBA. Of these, 41% were wearing some form of hearing protection. This percentage varied from 79% of workers exposed in SIC 76 (Miscellaneous Repair Service) to less than 1% in Communications (SIC 48), Wholesale Trade Nondurable Goods (SIC 51), and Automotive Dealers & Service Stations (SIC 55). Whether an establishment had a written policy on wearing PPE seemed to make no difference, because there appeared to be no tie between the percentage of workers wearing of hearing protection and presence of a PPE policy.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids on auditory localization performance. Six normal-hearing listeners localized a 750-ms broadband noise from loudspeakers ranging in azimuth from -180degree to +180degree and in elevation from -75degree to +90degree. Independent variables included the presence or absence of the hearing aid and the elevation of the source. Dependent measures included azimuth error, elevation error, and the percentage of trials resulting in a front-back confusion. The findings indicate a statistically significant decrement in localization acuity, both in azimuth and elevation, occasioned by the wearing of CIC hearing aids. However, the magnitude of this decrement was small compared to those typically caused by other ear-canal occlusions, such as earplugs, and would probably not engender mislocalization of real-world sounds.

Spectral and intensity analyses showed that the MCAA is a high intensity transient signal with peak energy between 2 and 5 kHz, and peak amplitudes in the first 100-200 musec. At EMFS levels of 50-100% of maximum output (2.0 Tesla), the corresponding MCAA levels were 131-142 dB sound pressure level (peak hold) at the outer ear and amplified by the external meatus to reach 145-157 dB sound pressure level (SPL) at the position of the tympanic membrane in rabbits. Measurements of the acoustic middle ear muscle reflex (AMR) in non-anesthetized rabbits indicated that exposure to EMFS levels of 50-100% resulted in correspondingly increasing compound threshold shifts (CTS) and permanent threshold shifts (PTS) in the unprotected ears of the experimental animals. Auditory brain-stem responses (ABR) measures on the same and additional animals corroborated these findings. Morphological studies showed evidence of substantial cochlear trauma at EMFS levels as low as 50%, with increasing severity up to 100% EMFS. Morphological examination of inner ear structures following exposure to the MCAA in the acute preparation (fixed within hours after exposure) showed ruptures between pillar cells and a detached organ of Corti. Preparations examined 3 or more weeks after exposure showed damaged pillar cells, a widespread loss of outer hair cells, fused and fractured inner hair cell stereocilia, and kinocilium outgrowth on inner hair cells. Although this extremely short impulse contains approximately 2 orders of magnitude less acoustic energy than a continuous noise exposure of 131 dB for 15 min, it is substantially more injurious to the cochlea. The present findings suggest that the acoustic artifact procuced by the EMFS coil in some clinical instruments may pose a potential risk for temporary and permanent hearing loss in patients and clinicians when held in close proximity to the unprotected ear. Initial studies suggest that the magnetic field alone did not appear to cause permanent hearing impairment. We recommend the use of ear protectors for the patient and clinician during EMFS as a precautionary measure to prevent possible hearing loss from the MCAA.

AB  - Extracranial electromagnetic stimulation (EMS) is a recently developed clinical technique which may be used in place of conventional transcutaneous electrical stimulation to activate the central and peripheral nervous systems. This technique is widely used in neurology and otolaryngology for non-invasive stimulation of the brain and facial nerve. EMS uses electromagnetic field pulses which pass unimpeded through the cranium and soft tissues to activate excitable membranes of volume conductors. In this series of studies, the effects and side-effects of electromagnetic stimulation on the auditory system of humans and experimental animals were investigated. In the first study, 18 profoundly hard-of-hearing and deaf patients who were candidates for cochlear implants were examined by non-invasive EMS in an effort to determine whether EMS could stimulate residual neurons in the cochlea, 8th nerve proper, or higher auditory brain centers, and evoke auditory sensations. The patients were stimulated with a magnetic coil positioned at the (1) auricle, (2) mastoid process, and (3) the temporal lobe area. EMS elicited auditory sensations in 26 ears (of 14 patients/subjects). The lowest threshold of auditory sensation (TAS) at each stimulus position was found to be at the 20 % EMS level, with a range of 20-50 % of the maximum level (2.0 Tesla), and with equal sensitivity in each coil position. There was no correlation between the EMS/TAS and the immediate postoperative psychoacoustic tests in ten patients receiving cochlear implants. A prominent side effect of EMS was found to be the high intensity, high frequency impulse noise generated by the coil which causes severe cochlear damage and permanent sensorineural hearing loss in experimental animals. Measurements of the sound pressure level (SPL) of the magnetic coil acoustic artifact (MCAA) at the tympanic membrane of the rabbit ear showed levels of up to 160 dB for maximum EMS. Measurements of the spectral content and SPL of the MCAA in the ear canal of life size models of the human cranium with the stimulating coil placed at standard clinical positions indicated that the major acoustic energy of the pulse is concentrated in the 2-5 kHz range, and that the SPL of the pulse at some positions may place persons at risk for hearing loss. Studies on computer simulated impulse noises showed that the peak sound pressure rather than the rise time (in the range 0.1 - 1.0 ms) determined the permanent threshold shift (PTS). The MCAA was more harmful than a 128 dB SPL continuous noise with 100 times more energy. The ear may be protected from the most damaging effects of the MCAA by the use of ear protectors. However, artificially activating the acoustic reflex with a contralateral broad band noise during exposure to the intense magnetic coil artifact reduced the PTS and protected the ear against noise-induced hearing loss. The findings on extensive and long term exposure of experimental animals to EMS showed no harmful effects on the brain or auditory system. It was concluded that EMS may induce sound perception in deaf ears and that the risk of acoustic trauma in normal ears due to the MCAA must be considered. It was further suggested that the EMS technique may be developed to be used in the selection of cochlea implant candidates and in stimulating surviving auditory neurons in deaf patients.

AB  - Multiple factors may contribute to the dyspnea associated with restrictive ventilatory disease (RVD). Simple models that examine specific features of this problem are likely to provide insight into the mechanisms. Previous models of RVD utilizing elastic loads may not represent completely the impact on pulmonary and chest wall receptors derived from breathing at low thoracic volumes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sensory consequences of breathing at low lung volumes induced by external thoracic restriction in an attempt to further elucidate the etiology of dyspnea in this setting. Ten men were studied, with and without an inelastic corset applied at residual volume (restriction resulted in mean reductions in vital capacity, functional residual capacity, residual volume, and forced expired volume in 1 s of 44, 31, 12.5, and 42%, respectively). During 10-min steady-state exercise tests (at a workload set to achieve ~65% maximum heart rate), restriction resulted in significant increases, compared with control, in minute ventilation (61 vs. 49 l/min), respiratory frequency (43 vs. 23 breaths/min), and visual analog scale measurements of respiratory discomfort (65 vs. 20 mm). Alveolar hyperventilation (end-tidal PCO2 = 39 vs. 44 Torr for control) and mild O2 desaturation (arterial blood O2 saturation = 93 vs. 95% for control) occurred. Hypoxemia, atelectasis, increased work and effort of breathing, or a decrease in the volume-related feedback from chest wall and/or lungs could be responsible for the increased dyspnea reported. External thoracic restriction provides a useful model to study mechanisms of dyspnea in RVD.

AB  - Lung function was assessed in 35 nonsmoking adults with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and 34 matched control subjects. The tests included spirometry, lung volumes, CO transfer factor and maximum respiratory pressures. Additionally, in subjects under 35 years of age (20 patients and 18 controls) measurements of CO transfer factor were obtained during exercise at three different workloads. Random blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin were measured and each patient's diabetic history was recorded. The total lung capacity (TLC) in the patients was lower than those recorded for the controls (P < 0.05) but there were no significant differences in respiratory muscle strength between the groups. In the young group of patients (< 35 years) the transfer factor for CO (TLCO) was similar but the volume corrected transfer coefficient (KCO) was higher at rest than in the controls (P < 0.02). The KCO remained high in these patients during exercise. The older patients (> 35 years) showed a lower TLCO (P < 0.01) with a similar KCO to the controls. The association of a reduction in TLC and higher KCO in the young patients suggests an extrapulmonary mechanism of lung volume restriction. This is not attributable to muscle weakness but might be due to limited expansion of the rib cage. In older patients any tendency for KCO to rise may be masked by disease-related changes in the pulmonary microvasculature.

AB  - A method for determining the optimum physical characteristics for auditory warnings was developed in the 1980s. Designated the Signal Design Window, the method took into account the noise environment, the hearing ability of the workforce, and the effects of hearing protectors. The method was computerised and, from the knowledge of the noise environment and the hearing ability of the workforce, it was possible to design signals that would be neither too loud nor too quiet for workers with poor hearing ability (as determined from their audiograms). The original model had drawbacks in that the masking calculation employed was symmetric and it did not take full account of the ranges of heating selectivity in the working population. Heating selectivity is not measured by a conventional audiogram. In particular, the experimental evidence suggested that a proportion of the working population could have elevated masked thresholds when wearing conventional heating protectors. The safety consequences of this effect are self-evident and they have implications for the routine use of hearing protection in industry. This paper presents a modified signal design window procedure, which incorporates revised calculations for the auditory filter including percentiles of auditory filter width based on a large sample of measurements of heating selectivity. The effects of hearing protectors are simulated and the distribution of elevated thresholds is compared across hearing protectors with differing attenuation characteristics. The implications for safety policies are explored. Relevance to industry. Auditory warnings are an important aspect of designing safe and productive workplaces. The complex interaction of environmental noise, hearing protection and heating loss needs to be adequately modelled to ensure auditory warnings are not masked.

AB  - Frequencies of job injuries, medical problems, and absences were compared for over 400 boiler plant workers in high noise job areas for 2 year periods before and after the advent of a hearing conservation program involving use of personal ear protection. Before after differences in most comparisons were significant and in directions showing fewer job injuries, medical problems, and absences after the advent of the ear protection program. Comparable record data from workers in low noise areas of the same plant showed no substantial changes over the same time periods, suggesting that the observed differences could not be accounted for by plant wide influences. Relationships between rated use of ear protectors and reduced frequency of the extra auditory problems were not altogether orderly. This finding plus some alternative explanations tempered the drawing of conclusions that excessive noise is a contributing cause of extra auditory problems. Recommendations for further study, using more direct investigative approaches, were given in order to obtain more definitive data on the relationship between noise and these problems.

AB  - 166 personal hearing protectors were evaluated using nine idealized noise spectra and six C-A category noise spectra. The mean R value for all 166 PHP's for each noise spectrum indicates that: (1) change in spectrum significantly affected the R value, and that (2) the 'worst case' noise spectrum was the -12 dB/octave slope. 2% of 262 actual noise spectra could be represented by a negative slope this severe. The R value determined with the -6 dB/octave slope would be indicative of the minimum protection obtained for 98% of the 262 noise spectra. The over-protection resulting from use of the -6 dB/octave spectrum would be approximately 10 dB for 88% of the noise spectra. With the assumptions that : (1) a 2% 'miss' factor could be tolerated, (2) that a 10 dB over-protection is not excessive, and (3) that the 262 noise spectra used herein represent those likely to be found in occupational settings, it is suggested that a -6 dB/octave slope be used in determining the R value for personal hearing protectors.

AB  - Samples of five insert-type hearing protectors (three viscose foam, one poly-flanged, and one glass fiber) were evaluated for change in attenuation as a result of 30 min of controlled jaw movement. Protected-ear, narrow-band noise thresholds were obtained at octave intervals (between 0.25 and 4.0 kHz) before and after the jaw-movement activity. Frequency and interaction effects were not significant. Protector effects were significant beyond the 0.01 level of probability that chance caused the observed differences. As a group, the viscose foam protectors were more stable than the others. The most stable protector was E.A.R., and the least stable was Bilsom Soft.

AB  - Noise is responsible for cochlear and general damages. Hearing loss and tinnitus greatly depend on sound intensity and duration. Short-duration sound of sufficient intensity (gunshot or explosion) will not be described because they are not currently encountered in our normal urban environment. Sound levels of less than 75 d (A) are unlikely to cause permanent hearing loss, while sound levels of about 85 d (A) with exposures of 8 h per day will produce permanent hearing loss after many years. Popular and largely amplified music is today one of the most dangerous causes of noise induced hearing loss. The intensity of noises (airport, highway) responsible for stress and general consequences (cardiovascular) is generally lower. Individual noise sensibility depends on several factors. Strategies to prevent damage from sound exposure should include the use of individual hearing protection devices, education programs beginning with school-age children, consumer guidance, increased product noise labelling, and hearing conservation programs for occupational settings. © 2001 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - A tripartite participation of government, trade unions and university was formed in 1988 to study the situation of industrial noise and hearing acuity of workers. Since 1982, the six industries identified by the Noise Control Office were construction, electronics, metals, plastics, shipbuilding and repairing, and textiles. Safety-subcommittees were formed. With the help of these subcommittees, 21 out of 32 medium-size factories responded to the study. A total of 922 sound measurements were made and 1062 out of 10724 workers were examined. More than one third (37.5%) of workers worked in locations with noise level in excess of L(eq) (8h) 90 dBA. Among examined subjects, 39.8% were exposed to L(eq) (8) 90 dBA and above and 18.6% were found to have industrial hearing loss. Multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex and age showed that for hearing loss, the important risk factors were duration of occupational noise exposure, noise intensity, floor vibration and military experience. Current legislation and measures in hearing conservation were inadequate despite the implementation of inspection by the Noise Control Office. Recommendations were directed at amending relevant legislation, increasing supervision of use of personal ear protection, and strengthening health education and audiometric surveillance of exposed workers.

AB  - Objectives: Hearing loss in the workforce, due to noise exposure, has attracted attention for decades in Taiwan. However, studies on this issue remain scarce. This report describes hearing loss for steel factory workers. Method(s): Steel factories in Taiwan are required to comply with "Workers Health Protection Regulation" by establishing records of routine hearing examinations for workers exposed to noise. We obtained, from 12 factories, 7160 workers' records of hearing examinations conducted in 1997 and 1998. Age-adjusted hearing acuity, particularly in the frequencies of 4kHz and 6kHz, was compared against "National Labors' Hearing Normal Distribution". This was used as a standard for estimating hearing impairment for each worker. Result(s): Hearing impairment was found for study subjects of all ages. Workers younger than 50 years had an average hearing loss of at least 14 decibels. Workers 50 years of age and above had an average loss of 20 decibels. Approximately 29% of workers had an average loss of 40 decibels or above in 4kHz and 31% workers had a similar level of hearing loss in 6kHz. Among all steel industrial workers in this study, almost none were classified for hearing protection management level 3. Analysis also revealed that using the three-, four- or six-distribution method for assessing hearing loss for steel manufacturing workers underestimates their hearing impairment. Conclusion(s): The steel industries fail to protect workers from hearing loss. This industry must be in compliance with the "Hearing Protection Project for Workers" act to halt the decline of hearing acuity for their employees.

AB  - Exposure assessment of metallic aerosols, gaseous emissions, and noise from a robotic-assisted metal spray [high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF)] process was conducted such that safety can be designed into the manufacturing system prior to production. Combustion gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons were monitored by direct readout instruments or gas chromatography. The overspray metallic aerosols were characterized by an eight-stage microorifice uniform deposit impactor in the 0.072 to 10-mum size range. A complete frequency spectrum for HVOF noise in the 2 to 25.000-Hz range was also determined with a high resolution data acquisition system developed for impulse noise. During the actual metal-spraying operation, concentrations of carbon dioxide and the hydrocarbon gases were at or below ambient levels except for carbon monoxide, which averaged 15 ppm. The metallic aerosols in the spray booth were mostly ultrafine particles in the 0.05 to 0.2-mum range, and the average mass concentration was 0.01 to 0.05 mg/m3. Thus, personal exposures at the current premanufacturing research and development stage do not present a serious health risk. However, due caution should be exercised as the process is scaled up, or if other alloys containing the more toxic species such as nickel or chromium are used. The HVOF noise is 125 dB(A) at 2 m from the spray gun and the broad band high frequency spectrum extends to 25 kHz, with a peak at 5 kHz. Workers involved in troubleshooting or start-up work inside the spray booth are required to wear both earplugs and earmuffs. As the HVOF process moves toward production, the operation of the system will be done in a control room where noise levels are below 70 dB(A).

AB  - The detectability of 5 different acoustic signals, used in coal mining, was tested and the influence of ear protectors on the listeners' performance measured. The ear protectors did not change the signal to noise ratio, which is the most important factor in signal detection in noise. The ear protectors did not impair the normal listener's ability to detect the acoustic signal against a background of noise, provided the signal itself is detectable when protectors are not used.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of movement activities and alternative fitting procedures on protection levels afforded by four hearing protection devices (HPDs). Psychophysical attenuation measurements at nine one-third-octave bands from 125 to 8000 Hz were obtained prior to, during, and following a 2-hr wearing stint that included periods of either highly kinematic but controlled work activity or vigorous temporomandibular movement. The 40 subjects, who were nonusers of HPDs, initially fit the protectors according to either the instructions on the package (i.e., subject fit) or after receiving interactive training on proper fit (i.e., trained fit). Therefter no further protector adjustments were allowed during the wearing period. The subject-fit condition resulted in significantly lower protection levels, from 4 to 14 dB, at 1000 Hz and below for a premolded polymer earplug, a user-molded foam earplug, and a double protector consisting of a muff over the foam plug. The muff alone was significantly more resilient to fitting effects on attenuation than were the plugs. Movement activity caused up to a 6-dB significant reduction in frequency-specific attenuation over time for the premolded plug, muff, and muff-plug combination. The complaint foam earplug was largely resistant to either type of movement effect but did benefit more than the other devices from use of the trained-fit procedure. Implications of the results for hearing protector testing protocol, device selection, and user training are discussed.

AB  - Hearing protection devices are tested for their attenuation characteristics under controlled laboratory conditions. Unfortunately, these tests overestimate the typical attenuation performance of the devices in the field, posing the possibility of inadequate protection for the user. Many factors may affect achieved in-field attenuation. This research investigated the influence of the user's work-related movement and variations in headband compression force and earcup cushion material (liquid- or foam-filled) on the frequency-specific noise attenuation achieved with earmuffs. Real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) testing procedures were used to collect attenuation data on 24 subjects both prior to and following completion of a simulated work task. Statistical analyses indicated that moderate work-related movement significantly decreased low-frequency attenuation but by only a small amount (1.5 dB at 125 Hz). A high headband compression force was found to increase attenuation by approximately 1.5 to 4 dB at 125, 250, 500, and 8000 Hz. There was no significant difference at any frequency between cushion types. The results indicate a small effect of moderate physical work activity on hearing protector effectiveness and illustrate the importance of certain earmuff design parameters to achieved attenuation.

AB  - The Real Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) of E-A-R (slow recovery) foam earplugs was determined, using three methods of presentation of the test tones during a single fitting of the earplug. The three presentation methods were (a) sound-field listening; (b) TDH49 earphone mounted in the shell of a circumaural earmuff; and (c) TDH49 earphone in a Model 51 cushion. Thresholds were tested once under each condition. Test frequencies were .125, .25, .5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 kHz. Comparison of the REAT values measured by the three methods indicated that the mean REAT obtained by the reference (Sound Field) method could be reliably estimated by both earphone methods for frequencies up to and including 4.0 kHz. However, the Sound Field REAT values of individual subjects could not be predicted reliably from their REAT determined by either type of earphone presentation. It is concluded that TDH49 earphones in standard audiometric earcushions could be used to check the overall effectiveness of slow recovery foam earplugs in the workplace. Further research is necessary to ascertain whether the audiometric earphone/earcushion test could be modified to achieve satisfactory reliability in assessing earplug fitting in individual workers.

AB  - We intend to describe the active noise control (A.N.C.) system, settled in the Laboratory of Mechanics + Acoustics (L.M.A.) for all kind of auditory cavities: helmets, headsets, ear plugs..., with passive acoustic insulation. This active system has to control the disturbing noise in a dynamic way, essentially in the frequency area, where the passive systems are inefficient. To our knowledge all studies undertaken in this field so far gave only a few convincing results. They were always developed in an empirical way and for only one kind of helmet. Modelling and determination techniques by the numerical simulation that we propose, allow a general and rigorous study of the problem, and a systematic application of the results, whatever is the considered cavity. In order to implement a broadband 'antinoise' in real time, we used a feedback system. The feedback loop is fitted out with electronic filtering. The role of the filter is to condition the modulus and the phase of the transfer function of the electro-acoustic system. Thus it is possible to control the frequency range of the application of the active noise control, the broadband and the absorbed sound energy, while retaining the stability of the looped system. The determination of the electronic filter parameters required is made with numerical algorithms of optimization, using the transfer function of the physical system according to its sampled shape. The experimental results that we present relate to various types of commercial helmets and headsets with passive insulation, as well as the prototype of an ear plug constructed at the L.M.A. Electronic filtering was carried out starting with simple analogical electronics. The antinoise measured in these auditory cavities show good system effectiveness. To conclude this work, we study the transmission of a communication signal in the cavity under antinoise conditions. Several solutions are possible, but only one provides an interesting result.

AB  - Three radiotelephones (AG-2, LUN and 'Hermetos variant') used in small aircraft were tested on 30 test persons for their subjective sound-damping effect with the aid of the Bekesy audiometer in open sound propagation environment. 'Hermetos variant' proved to have the highest sound-damping effect, followed by LUN. AG-2 was found to have the lowest sound-damping effect. A comparison of the subjective sound-damping effect with objective measurements by Demus and Lorenz showed that both the subjective and the objective methods should be used for evaluating the sound-damping effect of radiotelephones. None of the radiotelephones tested was able to dampen the sound sufficiently to comply with the maximum admissible noise levels prescribed by relevant TGL industrial standards. For this reason, further efforts should be made to improve individual hearing protection devices.

AB  - As a result of the examinations of physical and psychomental stress parameters, the hearing loss caused by noise, circulatory disturbances caused by the vibrations and carboxyhaemoglobin levels (CO-Hb), damages to the health of motor saw operators were classified as being an indicator of the inhalative stress due to motor saw exhausts. Despite the introduction of different technical facilitations in forest harvesting, the limits of continuous performance are regularly reached or even exceeded, which is supported by heart rate analyses carried out by means of digital tape store devices. Due to the high weight of the motor saws, the percentage of physiologically unfavourable static activities has even increased. By means of our own studies however, it could be demonstrated that a special job-oriented training carried out according to occupational and physiological points of view, could lead to lower heart rates and fewer exceeding of the continuous performance limit. The safety mask provided by the UVV, considerably reduces the luminous intensity as well as the field of vision of the motor saw operator. In combination with the hazardous work of operating a motor saw, this can lead to an increased psychomental strain. Unlike common safety masks reducing the intensity of illumination at the eye by 23-42%, the newly developed safety mask reduces it by 3-5%. In contrast to the noise nuisance in industry, working with motor saws implies frequent noise interruptions. Noise levels of up to 110 dB(A) (90-100 dB(A) on an average) however can cause noise trauma deafness. A study of 1179 forest workers in Lower Saxony showed that they suffered much more frequently from hearing loss than men of the same age that were not exposed to noise. The hearing loss showed a positive correlation to the duration of noise nuisance (years of noise exposure). Even compared to a group of industrial workers exposed to different kinds of noise, hearing loss occurred much more frequently among the forest workers exposed to noise over many years. However, ear protection has been accepted increasingly and thus occupational diseases caused by the noise of motor saws have showed a downward tendency. A characteristic clinical picture among motor saw operators were circulatory disturbances caused by vibrations. They have almost disappeared now, because of the newly introduced damped and heated motor saw handles. New cases of this disease have become rare. During soft timber harvest when working by the piece, the BAT-value for CO-Hb (5%) is often exceeded. During the first 2-3 hours of work time, CO-Hb levels increase until they have reached their maximum values. After that, they slowly decrease again which is due to a reduced working capacity (caused by fatigue) and thus to shorter operating times of the motor saws. In this case, measurements carried out at the end of the workshift are not appropriate for determining the maximum CO-Hb stress for motor saw operators.

AB  - Integrated electronics are being introduced into various type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure information and alarm functions. This is the case for hearing protection devices and electro-optical filters for arc welding (protection) as well as for respiratory protective equipment (information and alarm). The use of electronics raises questions concerning the level of protection afforded by these types of PPE and their conformity to the essential requirements laid down in concerned European directive. The level of protection of PPE including electronics shall be at least equivalent to that of standard PPE. In order to provide an answer to those concerned, this article proposes a method used in the machinery domain, which is based on one index of risk determination and the approach from the angle of safety. It leads to the determination of the category of EN 954-1 standard, also used in the safety of machinery domain, to which the PPE belongs. According to that category, technical measures are to be considered at the design stage of PPE including electronics in order to reach the required level of protection. These additional requirements are to be proposed for their insertion in national, European and international standards. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Hearing loss resulting from exposure to permanent or repeated amplified music in professional musicians and music consumers is described in literature. The risk of hearing loss does not exist only after prolonged exposure to music. Short-term exposure to very high sound levels, for example in concerts, can also cause hearing loss and tinnitus. Patient(s): The retrospective study includes 24 patients who required rheologic therapy between 1994 and 1997 due to a music related acoustic trauma. The type, intensity, and length of music exposure as well as the distance and the position to the source of noise were examined. The type of hearing damage and its development during theological treatment was studied by pure-tone audiometry. Result(s): In the majority of examined patients (67%) the hearing loss developed on the basis of one-time exposure at a rock concert or pop concert, followed by hearing loss from attending discotheques (17%) or parties (12%), and music exposure from personal cassette players (4%). The majority of patients showed a maximum hearing loss of 40-60 dB (A) in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Pure-tone audiometry in 58% of the patients exhibited a unilateral threshold in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz combined with ipsilateral tinnitus of the same frequency. Twenty-one percent of the patients showed a symmetric bilateral threshold and tinnitus between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. In 8% there was a unilateral tinnitus, and in 13% a bilateral tinnitus without any hearing loss. All patients improved their hearing loss during rheologic treatment. Improvement in the tinnitus was only achieved in 33% of the examined cases. Conclusion(s): The risk of permanent hearing loss resulting from short-term exposure to amplified music is low compared to the risk of continuous tinnitus. Given the lack of acceptance of personal ear protectors, the risk of acute hearing damage due to amplified music could be reduced by avoiding the immediate proximity to the speakers.

AB  - The low-pass filter of the high-frequency range loss, caused by noise, limits persons with industrial noise deafness to hearing low-frequency ranges. Yet, through environmental noises this limited frequency range is masked in such a way that only a small speech range is left at their disposal for speech perception. In addition, speech hearing is reduced by disturbances in the supra-threshold range. The actual auditive hindrance of these people can not be shown by the usual speech audiometric tests. Ear protectors in the form of mouldable plugs (cotton-wool, foam plugs) above all cause an additional hearing-loss in the high-frequency range which is important for the perception of consonants. Thus, four-syllable words are better understood than one-syllable ones. The loudness level of normal and loud speech no one-syllable word can be perceived. Due to the use of ear protectors, low-grade industrial deafness leads to high-grade combined deafness. This explains the complaints of people who are hard of hearing regarding the reduction of their communication at work. To avoid overprotection, ear protectors should be selected according to the place of work. The noise should be reduced below the level of 85 db (A) but not lower than 70 dB (A).

AB  - To determine if the loud noise generated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging equipment is capable of inducing hearing loss, the hearing of 24 patients was tested before and after MR imaging. Fourteen patients were imaged without ear protection, and six (43%) suffereed a temporary, mild loss of hearing (<= 15 dB at at least one frequency). Ten patients were imaged with ear protection, and only one experienced any hearing loss. Therefore, the noise generated by MR imagers may cause temporary hearing loss, and earplugs can prevent this loss. All threshold changes had returned to within 10 dB of baseline by 15 minutes after completion of the second audiometric test.

AB  - Hearing damage suffered by male workers in an automobile sheet-metal pressing plant has been studied on five occasions during the period 1964-89. The hearing threshold data have been analysed in order to determine hearing loss due to noise in various age groups. The hearing thresholds were better on later occasions. In the youngest group of workers only 45% exhibited normal hearing in 1964, while in 1989 the corresponding figure was 88%. The same tendency towards improved hearing could also be seen in the age groups 30-39 and 40-49 years. In the oldest age group, 50-59 years, hearing handicap decreased from 58% in 1964 to 11% in 1989. With the aid of the average hearing loss, it has also been possible to estimate the equivalent noise level to which present-day workers have been exposed, as well as the reduction in level of exposure during the past 25 years. The effects of a long-term technical and medical occupational health care programme including noise-reduction measures and improved use of hearing protectors are discussed.

AB  - 1240 coalminers were examined otoscopically and by audiogram. For all age groups and for the collective mean value and standard deviation, thresholds for hearing (dB) were calculated. The audiograms obtained showed sloping changes which involved low and high frequencies and indicated that the understanding of conventional speech was impaired. The investigation also shows that a rising number of claims for damages for hearing loss in miners will occur in the near future. However, coalminers should be motivated to use personal hearing protection through standard conservation measures.

Although mandatory hearing conservation programs (HCPs) have been in effect since 1972, this problem persists, as hearing protectors are not consistently used by workers, or may not attenuate to manufacturer's estimates in real world conditions. In this study, information from noise and hearing protection use measurements taken at an automobile assembly plant were used to construct average lifetime noise exposure and hearing protection compliance estimates for use in modeling to predict both total hearing loss and onset of two accepted definitions of hearing loss. There were 301 males and females in this cohort; their mean age was 42.6 (7.2) years, and mean tenure was 14.3 (3.5) years. Average length of follow-up was 14.0 years. There were 16 members of this cohort who had hearing loss at the speech frequencies (defined as an average hearing level >=25 dB at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). In cross-sectional multivariate analyses, years of employment, male gender, and proportion of time wearing hearing protection were the factors most associated with hearing loss at the average of 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz (p%<0.0001) controlling for age, transfer status (as a surrogate for previous noise exposure), race, and lifetime average noise exposure. The most consistent predictor of hearing loss in both univariate and multivariate analyses was percentage of time having used hearing protection during the workers' tenure.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the usefulness of monitoring patients' heart rates during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Method(s): The heart rates of patients were monitored, in an attempt to discover a useful method of demonstrating a patient suffering from an anxiety-related reaction. A self-answer questionnaire was developed, to ascertain which particular aspects of the MRI scan patients most disliked. Result(s): Of the 40 subjects studied, three patients demonstrated an increase in heart rate-which suggested that they were suffering an anxiety-related reaction. The questionnaire illustrated concern about the results of the scan, the confined space within the scanner and the noise created by the equipment, to be the three most disliked experiences of the MRI scan. Discussion(s): It was discovered that monitoring patients' heart rates during an MRI scan was useful. Of the four patients who pressed the panic button, three were those whose heart rates suggested they were suffering from an anxiety-related reaction and the other patient experienced tachycardia which is also associated with anxiety. Each patient who pressed the panic button attributed their concern to a single aspect of their experience. Conclusion(s): Monitoring patients' heart rates may indicate whether a patient will become sufficiently concerned to press the panic button and seek reassurance. The use of ear plugs, sedation, educating the patient and other measures should be employed to alleviate each patient's individual discomfort. Further research is required to discover methods of improving patient care, an integral part of any diagnostic examination, to enable patients to complete the scan in comfort, thus improving system efficiency.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of two types of hearing protectors on auditory localization performance. Six listeners localized a 750-ms broadband noise from loudspeakers ranging in azimuth from -180degree to +180degree and in elevation from -75degree to +90degree. Independent variables included the type of hearing protector and the elevation of the source. Dependent measures included azimuth error, elevation error, and the percentage of trials resulting in a frontback confusion. Performance on each of the dependent measures was found to be mediated by one or more of the independent variables. Actual or potential applications include the generation of improved design guidelines for hearing protectors and workplace alarms.

AB  - Noise induced hearing loss in the underground coal mining industry has been linked to the reluctance to wear hearing protection due to the perceived problems with hearing the audible indicators of roof fall - the 'roof talk'. The Roof Talk project aimed to describe the frequency characteristics of roof talk, the importance miners place on roof talk and, using these results, to determine suitable hearing protection parameters. The findings from the project show roof talk has broadband low frequency components with no outstanding pure tone components. The noise levels and frequency distribution of roof talk is such that mining equipment will mask the roof talk when the mining equipment is operating. If the reluctance to wear hearing protection is to be overcome, special programs to modify miners' perceptions will be necessary.

AB  - Many years' exposure to noise with check peaks of over 90 dB(A) causes damage to the inner ear. Hypacusis due to noise, a notifiable occupational disease, is incurable, but its development and aggravation may be prevented by individual protective devices, such as protective cotton wool, elastic plastic plugs, and protective capsules. These offer various degrees of protection, and the choice therefore depends on the intensity of the noise. Although these devices bring about a certain discomfort, their use for individual hearing protection is obligatory.

AB  - To evaluate the comfort of hearing protection devices, two models of ear plugs and five models of ear muffs were tested. The psychophysical method of 'single stimuli' was applied on a group of 30 subjects with or without wearing the devices for a short duration of 15 min under noise condition of 100 dBa in the acoustic chamber as also on a group of 10 weavers with the protection devices worn for longer durations of 1 h, 4 h and 8 h under noise exposure of 102-104 dBA in the weaving shed. Each subject performed 8 trials with each type of device on different days. Application force and tightness of spring were also evaluated. The results yielded a comfort grading for hearing protection devices. The comfort grading, however, depended on several factors in addition to application force and tightness of spring, which has been discussed.

AB  - The noise levels of many off the road vehicles (ORVs) are potentially capable of causing damage to the human auditory mechanism. Most drivers of these machines refuse to wear ear protection because they contend that their helmets provide adequate attenuation. This study was designed to evaluate the attenuation of two typical recreational helmets. The results of this investigation indicated that recreational headgear alone is not sufficient protection from high noise levels. Drivers of ORVs should wear some form of ear protection in conjunction with their headgear until the noise levels of these machines are reduced.

AB  - The mandate of ASA Working Group S12/WG11 has been to develop 'laboratory and/or field procedure(s) that yield useful estimates of field performance' of hearing protection devices (HPDs). A real-ear attenuation at threshold procedure was selected, devised, tested via an interlaboratory study, and incorporated into a draft standard that was approved in 1997 [J. D. Royster et al., 'Development of a new standard laboratory protocol for estimating the field attenuation of heating protection devices. Part I. Research of Working Group 11, Accredited Standards Committee S12, Noise,' J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 99, 1506-1526 (1996); ANSI S12.6-1997, 'American National Standard Methods for Measuring Real-Ear Attenuation of Hearing Protectors' (American National Standards Institute, New York, 1997)]. The real-world estimation procedure utilizes a subject-fit methodology with listeners who are audiometrically proficient, but inexperienced in the use of HPDs. A key factor in the decision to utilize the subject-fit method was an evaluation of the representativeness of the laboratory data vis-a-vis attenuation values achieved by workers in practice. Twenty-two field studies were reviewed to develop a data base for comparison purposes. Results indicated that laboratory subject-fit attenuation values were typically equivalent to or greater than the field attenuation values, and yielded a better estimate of those values than did experimenter-fit or experimenter-supervised fit types of results. Recent data which are discussed in the paper, but which were not available at the time of the original analyses, confirm the findings.

AB  - The most commonly alleged experimental artifact associated with real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements of hearing protection devices (HPDs) was examined: Masking of the protected thresholds due to physiological noise amplified by the occlusion effect. An ear canal mounted subminiature microphone was used to obtain objective measures of physiological noise in occluded and unoccluded test conditions and of the insertion loss (IL) of insert, semi-aural, supra-aural and circumaural HPDs when exposed to broadband noise with a sound pressure level of 93 dB. Measurements spanned 1/3 octave bands from 125 Hz to 2 kHz. Attenuation was also measured via a subjective REAT procedure and the magnitude of the occlusion effect was examined via bone conduction audiometry. The IL data confirmed the accuracy of the REAT results except at the lowest frequencies tested, where the degree to which the REAT values were spuriously inflated was quantified and found to be device related. Furthermore, the magnitude of the error (which never exceeded 5 dB) could be predicted by measuring the physiological noise in the occluded ear and calculating how much this would mask the occluded threshold. It was noted that no evidence was found in the data to suggest a dependency of HPD attenuation on sound level.

AB  - When hearing conservationists select hearing protection devices (HPDs), all too often the principal and sometimes only criterion they consider is manufacturers' published attenuation values as summarized in the Noise Reduction Rating (NRR). Not only is undue importance placed on this rating, but inappropriate significance is also attributed to small differences between the NRRs for competitive products. Often the final selection is based on differences of only 1 dB in the labeled values. This is especially regrettable since NRRs and the laboratory measured attenuation values from which they are derived are, as will be discussed shortly, poor indicators of real world performance. Rather than concentrating inordinate attention on labeled attenuation values, hearing conservationists are much better served by studying the operational and ergonomic aspects of HPDs, by wearing the devices themselves, and by learning how properly to select and dispense hearing protectors and how to motivate their wearers. Extensive discussion of these issues has been previously published by Berger, Royster and Royster, and Gasaway. The purpose of this article is to review key elements of those topics, with particular attention to operational and ergonomic aspects and the proper perspective from which to view attenuation data and NRRs. Hearing protection devices may be broadly categorized into earmuffs, which fit over and around the ears (circumaural), earplugs, which are placed in the ear canal, and semiaural devices (also called semi-insert, concha seated, and canal caps), which are held against the canal entrance with a headband. Earplugs can be further differentiated into premolded, formable, and custom-molded varieties. Other categories include supra-aural devices that rest on the external ear, such as audiometric earphones, and helmets, which are often worn in the military.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - The published literature describing three real-ear-attenuation-at-threshold (REAT), nine above-threshold, and four objective methods of measuring hearing protector attenuation is reviewed and analyzed with regard to the accuracy, practicality, and applicability of the various techniques. The analysis indicates that the REAT method is one of the most accurate available techniques since it assesses all of the sound paths to the occluded ear and, depending upon the experimenter's intention, can reflect actual in-use attenuation as well. An artifact in the REAT paradigm is that masking in the occluded ear due to physiological noise can spuriously increase low-frequency (less than or equal to 500 Hz) attenuation, although the error never exceeds approximately 5 dB, regardless of the device, except below 125 Hz. Since the preponderance of available data indicates that attenuation is independent of sound level for intentionally linear protectors, the use of above-threshold procedures to evaluate attenuation is not a necessity. An exception exists in the case of impulsive noises, for which the existing data are not unequivocal with regard to hearing protector response characteristics. Two of the objective methods (acoustical test fixture and microphone in real ear) are considerable time savers. All objective procedures are lacking in their ability to accurately determine the importance of the flanking bone-conduction paths, although some authors have incorporated this feature as a post-measurement correction. The microphone in real-ear approach is suggested to be one of the most promising for future standardization efforts and research purposes, and the acoustical test fixture technique is recommended (with certain reservations) for quality control and buyer acceptance testing.

AB  - Where people may be exposed to noise levels requiring greater hearing protection than that offered by earplugs or earmuffs alone, it can be advantageous to combine the two. The author shows that tests carried out by this company demonstrated that the protection afforded by the combination is never as great as might be expected from adding the sum of that provided by each type used alone. No simple formula could be devised to predict the combined attenuation based on the results of that given by the devices used singly.

AB  - This paper compares dBA levels at the protected ear obtained using the ISO-NIOSH method with the NRR factor recently adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency. The study was done on 144 combinations of 12 noises and 12 protectors. In each case the sound level was predicted using each of the methods. The differences between the levels, E, was used to define the accuracy of the NRR. It was found that the level predicted using the NRR was always higher than measured, the difference ranging between 0 and 11.3 dBA. Because of this rather conservative estimation of the hearing protector's attenuation and the simplicity of its use, the application of the NRR factor in industrial hearing conservation programs is recommended strongly.

AB  - Weighted regression analysis was applied to determine the dependence of the hearing thresholds of 47,388 noise-exposed workers on age, sex, noise immission level, ear disease, head injury, tinnitus, hearing protector usage, and audiometric frequency in the range from 0.5 to 6 kHz. It could be shown that the hearing thresholds at any frequency are dominated by the age of the worker and that women, after equivalent exposure conditions, hear better than men. The relative effects of sex, noise immission level, ear diseases, tinnitus, and hearing protector usage are related to the audiometric frequency. Users of hearing protectors at the last audiometric investigation hear worse than nonusers. Hearing protector usage is strongly related with the hearing threshold in the low-frequency range. The noise immission level does not noticeably affect the hearing threshold below 3 kHz. The most important frequency of the noise immission level is as expected 4 kHz. For 4 kHz, it was shown that the variables age, noise immission level, tinnitus, head injuries, and ear diseases act in a good approximation additively on the pure-tone hearing threshold.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an accurate diagnostic test for detecting abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary system. Because it is noninvasive, MRCP appears to be more tolerable than ERCP, although this has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to compare patient satisfaction after MRCP and ERCP performed sequentially. METHOD(S): We prospectively recruited 34 patients undergoing ERCP, for whom an MRCP was able to be performed before ERCP. Patient satisfaction was assessed by validated questionnaires using seven-point Likhert scales (individual ratings and direct comparisons). The following dimensions were explored: anxiety, pain, discomfort, tolerability (relative to expectations), willingness to repeat the procedure, and overall preference. X2 and Student's t tests (paired and unpaired) were performed, and 95% CIs were provided. RESULT(S): Two patients (5.9%) were unable to undergo MRCP because of claustrophobia. The remaining 32 completed both tests (94% same day) and all questionnaires. Average age was 56 +/- 18 yr, and 66% were women. In 23 patients, some degree of biliary obstruction was suspected; nine patients had pancreatitis. Patients reported a lower degree of pain (p < 0.001) and discomfort (p = 0.047) with MRCP, but MRCP was more difficult than they expected (p = 0.012). Patients were marginally more willing to repeat MRCP (ns, p = 0.09). On direct comparisons, patients were more satisfied with MRCP regarding anxiety (p = 0.04) and pain (p = 0.001). Patients displayed a higher overall preference for MRCP compared with ERCP (p = 0.01); however, only 59% clearly preferred MRCP over ERCP. The most common problem with MRCP was claustrophobia or noise (n = 15), and the differences were more striking in the subgroup without this problem. The subgroup undergoing purely diagnostic ERCPs showed clear preferences for MRCP. CONCLUSION(S): In many respects, MRCP is well tolerated, and certain subgroups, especially those undergoing diagnostic ERCPs, prefer MRCP over ERCP. As an endoscopist, one needs to be aware of the limitations of MRCP and relay these to the patient, as it seems that patients find MRCP more difficult than anticipated, and a significant number still prefer ERCP over MRCP. Patient satisfaction may be further improved by reducing noise and claustrophobia with selective premedication, earplugs, and the use of the new quieter fenestrated magnetic resonance imaging scanners. © 2001 by Am.

AB  - This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates of the factory(study group) and office(control group) workers in a soap and detergent industry in Ilorin in relation to the occupational hazards of chemical fumes and detergent dust in the industry. Upper respiratory tract infections were found in 67.5% and 10.6% of the study group and control group respectively. The study shows that the factory workers experienced hazards (e.g. chemical fumes and detergent dust) at work more than the office workers. Personal protective devices such as boots, face masks, gloves, earmuffs and goggles were not consistently used since they were inadequate in supply, worn out and of substandard qualities. The general reduction in the mean values of peak expiratory flow rate in the factory workers than in the office workers as observed in this study may possibly, be a pointer to the effect of industrial exposure to chemical fumes and detergent dust over the years. There is the need to follow up these workers in order to detect early any possible disease and complications that may arise.

AB  - Noise induced hearing loss is today the most frequently occurring occupational disease in the German Federal Republic. The continuing effect of noise levels of 90 dB(A) or more over a whole working day for years presents the risk of hearing damage to a considerable proportion of those exposed. Hearing damage arises by destruction of the hair cells in the inner ear and is irreversible. By reason of the relevant regulations for the protection of workers (particularly the accident prevention provisions of the publication 'Noise' by the industrial trade unions) a duty is laid on the factory owner or operator to provide for the technical reduction of noise, such that the employees are not subjected to the risk of occupational hearing loss. If noise reduction is impossible, personal hearing protectors must be provided and those persons exposed to the noise must be subjected to regular supervisory examinations. The duty is laid on the employee to use the personal hearing protection so provided if the continous noise level exceeds 90 dB(A).

AB  - Speech recognition in background noise when wearing amplitude sensitive (non-linear) ear muffs was studied in the laboratory in 15 young normal-hearing test subjects. Low-redundancy sentences were presented from a loudspeaker in a background noise level of 70 dB (A) and the speech-to-noise (S/N) ratio yielding 50% correctly recognized words was determined. Three background noise spectra were tested: white noise, low-pass filtered noise (-12dB/octave) and high-pass filtered noise (12 dB/octave). Five listening conditions were used: no protectors, a pair of normal ear-muffs, a passive amplitude-sensitive ear-muff and two types of electronic amplitude-sensitive ear-muffs. An ANOVA shows that speech recognition is significantly influenced by type of hearing protector and by noise spectrum. The interaction between these factors was not statistically significant. In general, the test subjects obtained somewhat better speech recognition thresholds in noise when wearing electronic amplitude-sensitive ear muffs than without muffs, whereas the opposite was true for the passive amplitude-sensitive and the normal ear muffs.

AB  - Objectives: Although hearing protectors must be used as a temporary solution, their choice should take into account several aspects, such as ergonomic features, associated with this device. The present study aims to analyse the relationship between the acoustical attenuation efficiency and other aspects related to the comfort afforded by hearing protectors and, consequently, their acceptability when used in industrial noisy environments. Method(s): An evaluation of comfort was performed using a questionnaire, completed by 20 workers. Several scales related to the subjective feeling of comfort were used to quantify the comfort index of a given protector. Simultaneously, the time of usage of each protector was selfrecorded by each subject. To test the relationship between the comfort index and the time during which protectors were used, a two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was applied. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The results obtained seem to demonstrate that there are significant differences between catalogued and effective attenuation. Protectors with less catalogued attenuation, but with higher acceptability, i.e. which were more comfortable, tended to be more efficient than protectors with a higher catalogued attenuation, but which were less comfortable. Finally, it must be emphasized that high efficiency can only be achieved through the attainment of an adequate balance between the range of parameters likely to determine its usage.

AB  - The lateral skull cephalostat radiograph aids the clinical diagnosis of dental malocclusion and the study of variation in shape of the head in profile due to growth or to ethnic or idiopathic causes. If, however, the cephalostat machine is incorrectly aligned so that the central X-ray beam does not pass directly through the two external auditory meati, the head position is altered so that bilaterally symmetrical structures fail to coincide, each appearing as a double shadow. If such an outline is traced, the values of routinely used cephalometric angles are also likely to be altered. Since to repeat taking the radiograph increases the patient X-ray dosage, it may be preferable to accept the misaligned picture, but to quantify and correct the error by measuring the direction and distance of displacement between the earplug shadows. Error can occur by a horizontal rotation around a vertical axis, by vertical tilting around a horizontal antero-posterior axis or by a combination of both factors. In contrast, error does not normally arise from tilting around a horizontal antero-posterior axis or by a combination of both factors. In contrast, error does not normally arise from tilting around the horizontal lateral axis (nodding), through this would affect the plane of orientation of the head.

AB  - The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Noise and Hearing Loss brought together biomedical and behavioral scientists, health care providers, and the public to address the characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss, acoustic parameters of hazardous noise exposure, individual and age-specific susceptibility, and prevention strategies. Following a day and a half of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel weighed the evidence and prepared a consensus statement. Among their findings, the panel concluded that sounds of sufficient intensity and duration will damage the ear and result in temporary or permanent hearing loss at any age. Sound levels of less than 75 dB(A) are unlikely to cause permanent hearing loss, while sound levels above 85 dB(A) with exposures of 8 hours per day will produce permanent hearing loss after many years. Current scientific knowledge is inadequate to predict that any particular individual will be safe when exposed to a hazardous noise. Strategies to prevent damage from sound exposure should include the use of individual hearing protection devices, education programs beginning with school-age children, consumer guidance, increased product noise labeling, and hearing conservation programs for occupational settings. The full text of consensus panel's statement follows.

AB  - In certain industrial processes, such as grinding and forging, reduction of noise is not feasible: operators need to be protected from the noise in order to avoid permanent hearing damage. This may be done by means of ear caps or plugs of cotton wool. Ear caps differ in sound-reducing effect and in wearing comfort. The latter factor is often largely ignored, but a very effective cap that is so uncomfortable that operators refuse to wear it is still useless. A compromise is then to be preferred.

AB  - There are four main ways of dealing with noise problems involving machinery: 1. Reduce the noise level at source by replacing the machine with a quieter model. 2. Modify the existing machine. 3. Apply noise control methods by using enclosures, screens, barriers or absorbers. 4. Supply ear defenders to the operators. Of these, 1 may be impracticable and 4 unsatisfactory because of employee resistance. This leaves 2 and 3 as the most promising. It is worth while checking whether simple modifications can be made to the machinery since the improvements obtainable may be far greater than by subsequently trying to stop the noise travelling to where it is not wanted. Can a production machine be modified to stop components hitting each other or against panels on the machine? Are metal panels rattling because screws or rivets have loosened? Is the noise being caused by excessive clearances due to wear or the build up of design tolerances? Are there unsilenced air intake or exhaust vents? These are the sort of questions to be considered before trying to reduce the noise by the use of suitable acoustic materials. As far as the enclosure solution is concerned, a tightly sealed room with massive walls will generally contain the noise. The emphasis here is on 'tightly sealed'.

AB  - Ear damage caused by welding sparks is not uncommon and varies in severity from minor burns to penetrating injuries, which result in lasting impairment of the inner ear. These cases should be remitted as an emergency measure for special treatment. A welding spark lodged in the tympanum should be removed without delay since it may otherwise prove hard to find by reason of membrane granulation tissue in the middle ear. The most important preventive measure is the use of noise protection in the form of ear muffs or padding.

AB  - A field investigation was conducted to determine what measures industry can take to avoid the need of a prolonged rest period before performing audiometry in order to avoid measuring temporary threshold shifts. If a plant has numerous employees exposed to loud noise audiometric testing can be very costly if it has to be done after employees have been off their jobs for 14 hr or more. The purpose of this field study was to develop preliminary guidelines that will enable industry to establish a time schedule for audiometric testing. It was found that in a steady noise of 89 to 90 dBA, employees with essentially normal hearing sustain little TTS at any frequency when tested three minutes after a three hour exposure. Since intermittent noise is known to have less effect on TTS than steady noise, it seems reasonable to assume that intermittent noise exposures of 90 dBA or less should not be a reason for deferring the taking of audiograms. In continuous noise levels of 91 to 92 dBA threshold average shifts were around 10 dB in the higher frequencies and tolerable for the intent of this investigation, but some employees could be expected to show losses perhaps 10 dB higher. Based on past experience, the authors recommend at least a 15 minute period away from work before audiograms are performed. In continuous noise levels of 93 to 95 dBA the TTS becomes very measurable when employees do not wear ear protectors. Audiograms in such instances should be done only after perhaps an hour or more of absence from noise. One solution to the problem of scheduling hearing tests without increasing costs and slowing production is to be certain that employees sceduled for testing wear protection prior to the time for the test. In continuous noise levels up to 104 dBA it is practical to do audiograms free of TTS on employees who effectively use ear protectors after such employees have been away from noise from five minutes. The emphasis here is on effective use of ear protection. Routine audiograms are the only accurate means now available for monitoring the effectiveness of ear protectors. It is still desirable to do the initial baseline audiograms after a substantial time away from noise over 90 dBA, until more extensive studies have been completed. The findings in this study can serve as a reasonable guideline for scheduling audiometric tests in industries with continuous noise levels below 105 dBA.

AB  - The article gives a survey of the present knowledge on sleep disturbances caused by noise, and contains some proposals for measures to be taken by public authorities. The conditions under which a night of sleep takes place are shortly described; the parts played by the intensity of noise, the various stages of sleep and the individual variables are mentioned. As a matter of fact, noise influences sleep only relatively and not absolutely. Noise affects light and sometimes paradoxical sleep more than deep sleep, elderly people are more easily awakened than children etc. Some statistics are given as to the consumption of ear plugs, which seems to be an effective indicator of annoyance caused by noise. Finally, it is shown that habituation to nocturnal noise is very doubtful (one can get used to annoyance but not to noise), and an attempt is made to determine individual and social consequences which nocturnal noise may provoke.

AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to focus both management and employee attention toward hearing impairment as a serious problem and 2) to deliberately and systematically motivate management to institute a hearing conservation program (HCP). The study included preworkshift and postworkshift audiometric tests performed on 152 male textile plant workers exposed to daily noise levels averaging 97.4 dB(A) without hearing protection of any kind. The average hearing threshold for separate age groups was used to evaluate hearing trends. The mean hearing level of three frequencies - 0.5, 1, and 2kHz - was chosen as an index of hearing impairment, with the beginning handicap set at 25 dB hearing loss. Each employee responded to a Social Communication Ability questionnaire. Educational materials and a set of thought-provoking questions were used to stimulate management's interest in accepting hearing impairment as a real threat to employees' productivity and quality of life. The average of combined temporary and permanent threshold shift was in the range of 28 to 31 dB, showing a hearing handicap for the workers as a whole after a daily workshift. The hearing handicap interfered with the workers' everyday living to varying degrees by reducing their ability to communicate with others in society. Overall results provided tangible evidence of the noise problem in the plant. As a consequence, the company hired a part-time industrial hygienist and outlined a policy on a continuing HCP. In addition, a detailed noise survey was performed, and various measures for controlling noise exposure were considered. The implementation of a noise-reduction plan that would decrease the noise to an acceptable level was not deemed feasible; therefore, the hearing protectors became the main control method in the plant. Finally, regular audiometric testing and training programs were instituted for both management and employees. In conclusion, a hearing impairment study as described herein can be used to demonstrate the adverse impact of excessive noise exposure and support an HCP.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of hearing loss associated with occupational noise exposure and other risk factors. Design(s): A cross-sectional study involving 269 exposed and 99 non-exposed subjects (non-industrial noise exposed subjects) randomly selected. Current noise exposure was estimated using both sound level meter and noise-dosimeter. Past noise exposure was estimated by interview questionnaire. Otoscopic examination and conventional frequency (0.25-8 kHz) audiometry were used to assess the hearing loss in each subject. Result(s): 75% (202 subjects) from the exposed group were exposed to a daily Leq above the permissible level of 85 dB(A) and most (61%) of these did not and had never used any form of hearing protecion. Hearing loss was found to be bilateral and symmetrical in both groups. Bivariate analysis showed a significant hearing loss in the exposed vs non-exposed subjects with a characteristic dip at 4 kHz. Thirty eight percent of exposed subjects had hearing impairment, which was an 8-fold higher rate than that found for non-exposed subjects. Multivariate analysis indicated exposure to noise was the primary, and age the secondary predictor of hearing loss. Odds of hearing impairment were lower for a small sub-group of exposed workers using hearing protection (N=19) in which logistic regression analysis showed the probability of workers adopting hearing protective devices increased with noise exposure, education, and awareness of noise control. Hearing loss was also greater amongst those who used headphones to listen to recorded cassettes. Conclusion(s): Gross occupational exposure to noise has been demonstrated to cause hearing loss and the authors believe that occupational hearing loss in Saudi Arabia is a widespread problem. Strategies of noise assessment and control are introduced which may help improve the work environment. Copyright © 2001 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

AB  - The detection of one-third octave signals superimposed on backgrounds of steady-state and intermittent industrial noise of 84 dBA was investigated for observers with normal hearing or moderate to severe noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Variables included age, noise exposure history, configuration of the audiogram and the wearing of insert hearing protectors. Detection thresholds were obtained binaurally over headphones using a two- interval forced-choice procedure. For unprotected listening all observers showed a masked threshold of about 80 dBA for a one-third octave band centered at 3.15 kHz. Neither variation in noise exposure history nor configuration of the audiogram were significant factors. Using insert protectors in noise, observers with normal hearing showed an advantage on average of 3 dB. Those with NIHL gave masked detection thresholds greater than 100 dBA. Detection of a one-third octave band centred at 1 kHz by hearing-impaired observers with mild to moderate loss at 1 kHz was similar to that for normal observers. A model of the detection process was developed and evaluated.

AB  - Auditory perception with hearing protectors was assessed in three groups of subjects, two with normal hearing, but differing in age, and one with moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Individuals were tested with the ears unoccluded, and fitted with each of two level-dependent ear muffs and their conventional level-independent counterparts. One of the former devices provided limited amplification. In each of these five ear conditions, the threshold of audibility for one-third octave noise bands centered at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz, consonant discrimination, and word recognition were measured in quiet and in a continuous impulse noise background. The results showed that the attenuation of sounds (i.e. the difference between protected and unoccluded thresholds) in quiet did not vary as a function of age or hearing loss for any of the four protectors. In noise, the difference between protected and unoccluded listening was close to zero, as long as hearing was normal. With hearing loss as a factor, there was a significant increment in the protected threshold, the amount determined by the device. Word recognition in quiet was adversely affected in normal hearing listeners by the three attenuating devices but improved in noise relative to unoccluded listening. Amplification had a deleterious effect for both consonant discrimination and word recognition in noise. In hearing-impaired listeners, speech perception was impeded by all four muffs but less so in quiet with limited amplification.

AB  - This research investigated the effect of ear protectors on the intelligibility of speech in noise. Listeners with normal hearing, high-frequency, and flat loss were tested. Half the subjects in each group were fluent in English and half poorly conversant. Taped lists of 25 words were presented free field under conditions defined by the speech-to-noise ratio, spectrum of noise background, and presence of ear protection. The results showed that intelligibility decreased with speech-to-noise ratio and was poorer in crowd noise than in white noise. The protector had no effect for the normal listener, but caused a substantial decrement in those with impairment. In all groups nonfluency contributed an additional loss of 10% to 20%. Significant differences in performance were noted for different muff and plug types.

AB  - This cross sectional study was conducted among textile mill workers in Bahir Dar town in 1995/96. The main objective of the study was to investigate how workers perceive their work environment and explore their state of satisfaction with their work. A pretested questionnaire was administered by trained health workers to 394 production workers. The majority of the workers (53.6%) claimed the work environment to be hot. For 66.8%, the physical conditions around the working departments was worst during the hot season. The work place was perceived as dusty and noisy by 47.2% and 36.0% of the respondents respectively. The distribution of adverse environmental complaint by work department was not the same. A higher proportion of the workers in the spinning department complained of inadequate air movement (64.5%) and dusty work place (53.3%); whereas those in the weaving department complained the work place to be hot and noisy (60.5%, 53.5% respectively). Aprons were used by 95.7%, but other personal protectors such as ear protectors, gloves and goggles were used rarely. In general, 228 (57.9%) workers were satisfied but the rest were dissatisfied with their work environment. In order to improve the hygienic conditions in the work place, 71.2% suggested use of different kinds of personal protectors. In conclusion, personal protectors should always be used, environmental hygiene should be conducted and health education should be provided to workers.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the noise levels made by different clinical hand-pieces, laboratory engines, and other significant equipment such as ultrasonic scalers, amalgamators, high-speed evacuation, and other items. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sound levels were measured at four dental practices and three dental laboratories selected as representative of a variety of workplaces to reveal a range of noise. The noise levels were determined using a precision sound level meter, which was positioned at ear level and also at 2 meters distance from the operator. RESULT(S): Virtually all noise levels at the dental clinics were below 85 dB(A). The noise levels in the dental laboratories had much higher maxima, with some cutting activities, steam cleaning, and sandblasting up to 90 dB(A), and compressed air blasts with a maximum of 96 dB(A). CONCLUSION(S): The noise levels in the dental clinics are considered to be below the limit of risk of hearing loss. However, technicians and other personnel who spend many hours in noisy dental laboratories may be at risk if they choose not to wear ear protection.

AB  - Through the use of mathematical models, we have calculated the effect of a soldier's ability to hear on his or her capacity to perform a variety of militarily relevant tasks. Changes in hearing that can result from organic loss, the wearing of hearing protectors, the masking effect of noises, etc. can have a profound effect on performance, producing a militarily significant handicap. The normal ear is highly effective in detecting noises produced by personnel or their equipment or in understanding speech even in noise. By contrast, even modest hearing loss and/or the wearing of hearing protectors can have profound effects on military performance, for example, reducing the area that can be acoustically monitored by more than 30-fold or cutting warning times for other sounds by a factor of more than 100. This effort at calculating handicap has not been definitive, but it has shown in a preliminary was loss and that such information could be used in the establishment of job descriptions, in standards for acceptance and retention of personnel, and in the specification of acceptable noise levels for materiel.

AB  - The new EU directive (10/2003/EU) sets new limits for allowable noise levels and sets new requirements to accommodate the individual susceptibility factors, but does not define these factors. We aim to evaluate the effects of environmental and biological factors on the damage to hearing by noise. The history of work exposure, use of hearing protective devices (HPD), audiometric data and information on environmental and biological factors were collected from well over 1000 workers. The group consisted of 406 paper mill workers, 400 miners, 250 metal factory workers, 176 shipyard workers and 124 forestry workers. For comparison we evaluated 685 noise-exposed subjects visiting a hearing aid clinic for fitting of a hearing aid. They were exposed in their work to noise levels of 80-115dB(A). The environmental and biological factors encompassed smoking habits, the use of analgesics, serum cholesterol, systolic or diastolic blood pressure as well as noise exposure. There were a number of confounders which were significant factors in the hearing losses found in the noise-exposed workers. Sensitivity to sunburn, the presence of Raynaud's disease, a history of head injury and the use of analgesics correlated significantly with the extent of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The role of serum cholesterol levels as a risk factor for NIHL depended on the age of the subject, with the levels of middle-aged subjects having the greatest effect on NIHL. Hypertension or use of anti-hypertensive medication and use of analgesics correlated with hearing loss and their effect was additive. The correlation of tobacco smoking was also confounded by age. In analyses where the subjects were matched in pairs by age, exposure, blood pressure and serum cholesterol level, the elderly subjects were more susceptible to NIHL than younger subjects. In conclusion, among several susceptibility factors smoking and cholesterol are independently but causally related to NIHL and may cause the subject to be more susceptible for noise damage. Ageing further confounds some of these factors. The current ISO noise standard (1999-1990) has methodological deficiencies in not encompassing these susceptibility factors. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine behaviors and attitudes of Brazilian teenagers towards noise, and determine their audiological characteristics. Participants were 245 young persons (14 to 18 years old) who attended private school. Behaviors and attitudes were measured using the validated Portuguese version of the Youth Attitude to Noise Scale (YANS). Pure-tone audiometry was used to evaluate the hearing of a sub-sample of 24 participants. Music played through personal media players was the most common exposure reported. A substantial percentage of participants reported temporary tinnitus (69%) after attending discos, music concerts, and listening to music through headphones. Tinnitus complaints were more frequent among females (41%) than males (27%). Four participants (1.6%) reported use of a hearing protector. Among a subsample of 24 participants, two (8%) young women had bilateral audiometric notches. YANS scores in the present study were slightly lower than those obtained in Sweden and the US, indicating a more negative attitude towards noise. Gender, age, country, and/or region are variables that will influence exposure to noise or music and possibly hearing outcomes. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to experimentally estimate the potential of the tone audiometry technique for the determination of the sound-absorbing properties of various material. The study included 15 subjects at the age from 19 to 32 years. Their audiological examination was followed by the placement of the 5x7 cm spacer plate from the study material beneath the bone vibrator telephone to determine the bone sound-conduction threshold; no air-marking was undertaken. The sound absorption by the study materials of interest was determined in each octave-band from 250 to 8000 Hz from the difference between the starting audiogram and the audiogram of the material of interest. The study was carried out in three stages: (1) evaluation of sound absorption of each of the five materials, (2) measurement of the same parameter in the combinations of 2--4 layers for increasing sound absorption, and (3) fixation of the bone conduction telephone by the operator's hand (the head-mounted harness was used for the same purpose at stages 1 and 2). The experiments demonstrated that the study of bone sound conduction by means of tone audiometry allows to estimate the sound absorption of various materials. This technique may be applied for the development of a subjective method for the measurement of sound absorption in order to evaluate the acoustic effectiveness of materials that can be used to construct individual protective anti-noise devices.

AB  - Hearing Protection Devices (HPDs) can protect the ear against loud potentially damaging sounds while allowing lower-level sounds such as speech to be perceived. However, the impact of these devices on the ability to localize sound sources is not well known. To address this question, we propose two different methods: one behavioral and one dealing with acoustical measurements. For the behavioral method, sound localization performance was measured with, and without, HPDs on 20 listeners. Five HPDs, including both passive (non-linear attenuation) and three active (talk-through) systems were evaluated. The results showed a significant increase in localization errors, especially front-back and up-down confusions relative to the "naked ear" test condition for all of the systems tested, especially for the talk-through headphone system. For the acoustic measurement method, Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) were measured on an artificial head both without, and with the HPDs in place. The effects of the HPDs on the spectral cues for the localization of different sound sources in the horizontal plane were analyzed. Alterations of the Interaural Spectral Difference (ISD) cues were identified, which could explain the observed increase in front-back confusions caused by the talk-through headphone protectors. © 2014 Zimpfer and Sarafian.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current status of hearing loss and the use of earplugs in workers exposed to noise who have been provided earplugs in a city, as well as major influencing factors for the use of earplugs., METHODS: Cluster random sampling was used to conduct a questionnaire survey in workers exposed to noise who had been provided earplugs in 15 enterprises with noise exposure in a city from June to December, 2014., RESULTS: In the workers exposed to noise who had been provided earplugs, the rate of high-frequency anomaly in both ears was 57.8%, and the workers who kept wearing earplugs only accounted for 55.4%. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the protective factors for the use of earplugs included workers' own feeling of hearing condition (OR=1.704), comfort of earplugs (OR= 1.892), enterprise's inspection of the use of earplugs (OR=1.461), workers' knowledge of the function and usage of earplugs (OR=1.581), workers' understanding of the necessity of earplugs (OR=4.482), workers' initiative to search for related data (OR=4.029), the use of earplugs by colleagues (OR=5.071), and reminders from family members or friends (OR=2.678) (all P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: The workers exposed to noise in this city have a high rate of abnormal hearing, and only half of the workers keep wearing earplugs during work. The use of earplugs is related to the factors including workers' own feeling of hearing condition, comfort of earplugs, workers' knowledge of protection, the enterprise' s management of hearing protection, and environmental support.

AB  - Background: Complex noise and its relation to hearing loss are difficult to measure and evaluate. In complex noise measurement, individual exposure results may not accurately represent lifetime noise exposure. Thus, the mean LAeq,8 h values of individuals in the same workgroup were also used to represent LAeq,8 h in our study. Our study aimed to explore whether the mean exposure levels of workers in the same workgroup represented real noise exposure better than individual exposure levels did. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted to establish a model for cumulative noise exposure (CNE) and hearing loss in 205 occupational noise-exposed workers who were recruited from two large automobile manufacturers in China. We used a personal noise dosimeter and a questionnaire to determine the workers' occupational noise exposure levels and exposure times, respectively. A qualified audiologist used standardized audiometric procedures to assess hearing acuity after at least 16 h of noise avoidance. Result(s): We observed that 88.3% of workers were exposed to more than 85 dB(A) of occupational noise (mean: 89.3 +/- 4.2 dB(A)). The personal CNE (CNEp) and workgroup CNE (CNEg) were 100.5 +/- 4.7 dB(A) and 100.5 +/- 2.9 dB(A), respectively. In the binary logistic regression analysis, we established a regression model with high-frequency hearing loss as the dependent variable and CNE as the independent variable. The Wald value was 5.014 with CNEp as the independent variable and 8.653 with CNEg as the independent variable. Furthermore, we found that the figure for CNEg was more similar to the stationary noise reference than CNEp was. The CNEg model was better than the CNEp model. In this circumstance, we can measure some subjects instead of the whole workgroup and save manpower. Conclusion(s): In a complex noise environment, the measurements of average noise exposure level of the workgroup can improve the accuracy and save manpower.Copyright © 2015, Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - The current impulse noise criteria for the protection against impulse noise injury do not incorporate an objective measure of hearing protection. A new biomechanically-based model has been developed based on improvement of the Auditory Hazard Assessment Algorithm for the Human (AHAAH) using the integrated cochlear energy (ICE) as the damage risk correlate (DRC). The model parameters have been corrected using the latest literature data. The anomalous dose-response inversion behavior of the AHAAH model was eliminated. The modeling results show that the annular ligament (AL) parameters are the dominant cause of the non-monotonic dose-response behavior of AHAAH. Based on parametric optimization analysis, a 40% reduction of the AL compliance from the AHAAH default value removed the dose-response inversion problem, and this value was found to be within the physiological range when compared with experimental data. The transfer functions from the new model are in good agreement with those of the human ear. A dose-response curve based on ICE was developed using the human walk-up temporary threshold shift (TTS) data. Furthermore, the ICE values calculated for the German rifle noise tests show excellent comparison with the injury outcomes, hence providing a significant independent validation of the improved model. The ICE was found to be the best DRC to both large weapons and small arms noise injury data, covering both protected and unprotected exposures, respectively. The new AHAAH model with ICE as the dose metric is adequate for use as a medical standard against impulse noise injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We present a method to account for the effects of the hearing protection devices (HPDs) for use with the 8 hours equivalent A-weighted energy (LAeq8) criterion. The method involves the calculation of the LAeq8 equivalent unprotected free-field dose (LAeq8EUFF), which is obtained by using the insertion loss (IL) data of the HPD together with free-field pressure measurements., METHODS: The method was validated against the historical the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command walk-up study data with volunteers exposed to simulated large weapon noise wearing a range of HPDs. The IL data were obtained using standard acoustical test fixtures fitted with the matching HPDs in replicated field tests and using shock tubes at conditions comparable to the actual exposure intensities. Logistic regression calculations were performed to correlate the LAeq8EUFF values against the walk-up study outcomes to determine the L(95,95) threshold for the protection of 95% of the population with 95% of the time., RESULTS: Data comparison shows that L(95,95) is 89 dBA, which is slightly higher than the 85 dBA criterion but falls in the 80 to 90 dBA range as used by various NATO nations., CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, considering the limitation of the walk-up dataset, it is conservative to adopt the 85 dBA threshold for general application.Reprint & Copyright © 2016 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.

AB  - Hearing is critical to the performance of military personnel and is integral to the rapid and accurate processing of speech information. Thus, noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) represents a severe impairment that reduces military effectiveness, safety, and quality of life. With the high levels of noise to which military personnel are exposed and the limited protection afforded by hearing conservation programs, it should be no surprise that annual Veterans Affairs disability payments for tinnitus and hearing loss exceeded $1.2 billion for 2009 and continue to increase. Military personnel work in high-noise environments, yet the Department of Defense (DoD) cannot predict who is susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. Of those exposed to noise, 80% may also suffer from chronic tinnitus. Despite its prevalence, there are no means to objectively measure the severity of tinnitus in those individuals. A fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tinnitus and its relation to noise-induced hearing loss is critical. Such an understanding may provide insight to who is at risk for each condition, allow aggressive hearing protection measures in those individuals most at risk, and create areas for treatment for those already suffering from the conditions. The current review will address the scope of the problems of NIHL and tinnitus for the military, discuss the noise environments in which military personnel operate, describe the hearing conservation measures currently in place, and the challenges those programs face. Some recent breakthroughs in NIHL research will be discussed along with some challenges and directions for future research on NIHL and tinnitus. © 2012.

AB  - The prevalence of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss is increasing worldwide. Major factors contribute to this situation is the breach of the preventive measures. This study aimed to identify factors that caused the industrial workers to ignore the usage of the hearing protection device (HPD). Semi-structured focus group discussion was conducted to the sawmill workers of Pahang, Malaysia. Purposive sampling method was performed to obtain participants, who was exposed to continuous noise, working in the industrial field and frequently or never used the HPD during working. Participants were differed in term of gender, age, working experience and job. The conducted focus group discussion was recorded and all related information was transcribed. Analysis of the theme for the study was conducted using QSR Nvivo 9.2. Three main themes were identified which are: uncomfortable, less awareness and barrier in communication. 58% of the workers reported on uncomfortable feeling while 42% were lack of awareness and 25% feel that the devices created a barrier in communication. Therefore, as uncomfortable feeling was the main cause of the industrial workers not to wear the HPD, new types of HPD that follows user requirement should be invented.Copyright © 2016, Association of Indian Pharmacist.

AB  - To apply theory of reasoned action at survey on welding workers occupational health protection behaviors and explore related influencing factors. nine companies were randomly selected from areas with many welding works in Zhejiang Province. All welding workers were surveyed using a questionnaire based on theory of reasoned action. 10.06%, 26.80% and 37.50% of the respondents never or seldom used eyeshade, mask and earplug, respectively. After controlling the socio-demographic factors, welding workers' behavioral belief was correlated with the behaviors of eyeshade-mask and earplug use (chi(2) = 31.88, 18.77 and 37.77, P < 0.01). the subjective norm of company was correlated with all protection behaviors (chi(2) = 20.60, 10.98 and 19.86, P < 0.01), the subjective norm of colleague was correlated with mask and earplug use, (chi(2) = 27.43, 36.39, P < 0.01), and the subjective norm of family was correlated with mask use (chi(2) = 5.73, P < 0.05). Theory of reasoned action is suitable for welding worker occupational health related behaviors. It is useful to improve occupational health education, to effectively select health education objective and to tailor health education contents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coal mining industry relies heavily on a hearing protector (HP) for noise protection. Researchers suggested that individual HP fit tests be conducted to estimate the noise attenuation., OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether individual fit tests accurately predicted workers' ear plug noise protection while working and whether the real-time noise reduction (NR) remained constant in mining work while an ear plug was worn., METHODS: A total of 11 subjects from 3 coal mines each was fit tested using the microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) technique on their E-A-Rtrademark earplugs in a typical mine office. The same fit tested miners each wore the same type of earplugs in his usual manner doing his normal work. The minute-by-minute real-time NRwork values were determined continuously during full shifts of work., RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Results showed there was a modest prediction relationship (R2 = 0.53) between NRfit and NRwork. NRwork values of each miner's earplug fluctuated over 20 dBA while the earplug was worn. However, each was still able to achieve an average NRwork of more than 10 dBA, indicating the earplug was somewhat effective in reducing noise, if worn. Refitting was an important cause of the low NRwork values. Low-frequency noise sources might be also important causes.

AB  - Objectives Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented. A cross-sectional study aimed to a) assess sound pressure level (SPL) and average SPL for an 8-h period at working sites; and b) examine frequency of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) from audiometric screening and factors affecting NIHL of workers. Methods The samples recruited by purposive sampling comprised a) 18 factory departments, and b) 303 workers being removed from loudness for at least 8 h and voluntary willing to participate in this study. The research instruments included a) a sound level meter (Larson David 800 B), b) an audiometer (Fornix FA 12) and the quietest office room, and c) a questionnaire and recording forms. The chi2 test, relative prevalence (RP), and 95% CI were employed to analyse data. Results The findings showed the maximum SPL of 110 dB(A) and average SPL for an 8-h period of 91.9 dB(A) in the department of raw material preparation. Prevalence of NIHL was 52.1%. The sample used hearing protection devices of 23.1%. Factors significantly associated with NIHL at p<=0.05 were aged >=35 years (RP 1.80; CI 1.50 to 2.17), working year >=5 years (RP 1.29; CI 1.04 to 1.60), average SPL at working sites >=85 dB(A) (RP 1.61; CI 1.09 to 2.37), listening to loud radio and television (RP 1.68; CI 1.40 to 2.03). Conclusions To avoid excessive noise, the workers at risk should be encouraged to use hearing protection devices properly. Confirmatory audiograms and hearing conservation programs are needed to limit further hearing loss and its affect.

AB  - The lessons learned from this field study of hearing protector attenuation can be distilled for the safety manager into two recommendations: 1) One-on-one training is the best predictor of whether workers will achieve a good fit with their ear plug. While the sheer volume of individual training may appear overwhelming in some facilities, the results were significant and measurable in terms of protecting hearing. 2) If a worker obtains a poor fit with a particular style of ear plug, trying a different pair of ear plugs typically achieves an acceptable attenuation. But even if the different ear plugs do not provide proper fit, the employer still has the option of fitting ear muffs to that worker. Field testing of hearing protectors bridges the gap between the laboratory estimates of attenuation and the real-world attenuation achieved by workers as they normally wear the protectors. But most importantly, it restores the personal back into Personal Protective Equipment. And when it comes to hearing protection, achieving good protection is all personal.

AB  - Abstract Background Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major preventable occupational health problem with 250 million people worldwide known to have disabling impairment of moderate to greater severity. The aims of the study are to estimate the prevalence of NIHL in the police force; and study its association with age, sex, duration of service (years), smoking and alcohol habits, use of hearing protective devices, as well as preexisting chronic diseases. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 543 police personnel who had undergone periodic medical examination over a 12-month period. The diagnostic criteria for NIHL were (1) history of occupational noise exposure, (2) bilateral hearing loss, (3) hearing loss of >= 25 dBA at 4,000 Hz in two consecutive audiograms, and (4) no significant medical history affecting hearing. Severity of NIHL was based on the World Health Organization grading. Results Males (74.8%) made up the majority of the police force. The mean age for police personnel was 35.55 +/- 9.57 years, and the mean duration of service was 14.75 +/- 9.39 years. Compliance with the usage of hearing protective devices was seen in 64.4%. The prevalence of NIHL in this study population was 34.2%, with a higher prevalence in males (37.7%) than in females (23.9%). The study also showed strong associations between NIHL and male sex (odds ratio, 1.9; P < 0.05), and hypertension (odds ratio, 3.3; P < 0.001). Overall, 93% were found to have mild NIHL, 3.5% had moderate NIHL, and 3.5% had severe NIHL. No police personnel were found to have profound hearing loss. Conclusion The prevalence of NIHL in this study is high compared to other similar studies among police personnel. This study shows that increasing age, male, presence of hypertension, diabetes, and longer duration of service are significant associated factors for NIHL. Preventative strategies include health surveillance, implementation of a hearing conservation program, and legislation.Copyright © 2015, Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute.

AB  - Among orchestral musicians, horn players are one of the most at-risk groups for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). To investigate this group further, pure tone audiometry and a 14-item questionnaire were used to assess the hearing health, as well as attitudes and practices regarding hearing conservation, among 142 French horn players attending an international horn conference in Brisbane, Australia. Of this study's French horn players, 11.1% to 22.2%, and 17.7% to 32.9% of those aged <=40 years, showed some form of hearing loss (corrected for age and gender) typical of NIHL, using conservative versus lenient criteria, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed no obvious predictor of hearing loss in this study's participants. Of the 18% of participants who reported using hearing protection, 81% used this protection " sometimes" and 50% used generic, foam, or other inferior forms of protection. Continued efforts to better manage the hearing health of horn players is warranted particularly as any hearing loss will affect a horn player's ability to perform and therefore his or her livelihood. Managing the hearing health of horn players will be challenging, however, with no simple predictor of NIHL loss being identified in this study's sample. Copyright © 2013 JOEH, LLC.

AB  - Hearing loss affects 31 million Americans, particularly veterans who were exposed to harmful levels of noise during military functions. Many veterans also receive treatment with ototoxic medications, which may exacerbate preexisting hearing loss. Thus, hearing loss is the most common and tinnitus the third most common service-connected disability among veterans. Poor implementation of hearing protection programs and a lack of audiometric testing during medical treatment leave veterans vulnerable to unrecognized and untreated hearing loss until speech communication is impaired. Individualized audiometric testing techniques, including assessment of high frequencies, can be used in clinical and occupational settings to detect early hearing loss. Antioxidants also may alleviate cochlear damage caused by noise and ototoxicity. Ultimately, hearing loss prevention requires education on reducing occupational and recreational noise exposure and counseling on the risks and options available to patients. Technological advances will improve monitoring, allow better noise engineering controls, and lead to more effective hearing protection.

AB  - Objective: To compare measured bearing levels of individuals regularly exposed to noise in their workplace to self-reported and family-reported bearing loss. To compare the attitudes and preventative actions adopted by individuals who are more aware of the potential for hearing loss to less aware individuals. Design(s): The project examined the perceptions of rural workers concerning noise, noise exposure and bearing. The subjects completed a 'Noise at Work' questionnaire and some demographic data at the time of audiometric testing. Setting(s): The subjects were recruited when attending their rural health clinic for audiometric testing. Participant(s): Participants comprised 113 men and 23 women (20-65 years, mean = 39.6, SD = 11.4) working across a range of activities at different levels in their workplaces. The range in current employment was from 0.5 to 45 years (mean = 13.8, SD = 10.7). Result(s): Hearing tests were compared with perceptions of noise annoyance, bearing damage risk and preventative action. Self- and family-reported bearing loss and conversational difficulties in noise correlated well with measured audiograms. Perceptions of workplace noise tended to be more positive if people felt they bad bearing problems. There was no difference in preventative action between those who did and did not feel they bad bearing problems. Both groups rated barriers to action and lack of self-efficacy in a similar negative way. Conclusion(s): There is a need for specific training to ensure that rural workers have skills to take more positive action in reducing noise exposure at work.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to look at the expectations and actions that exist around the use of hearing protectors. Are our expectations for the performance of hearing protectors rational and is the way we expect them to be used reasonable? Perhaps we are expecting too much of hearing protectors and their ability to effectively reduce noise exposure. Better understanding of expectations and requirements along with improvements in technology and design offer the opportunity to markedly improve on the current situation.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is critical to the prevention of hearing loss in children and young adults. To meet that goal, this paper focuses on the relationship between the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss, attitudes to noise and exposure, and how hearing protection use seems to be linked to cultural and socioeconomic factors. Results of a scries of studies point to attitudes as one explanatory factor. Additionally, the experience of hearing symptoms such as tinnitus and noise sensitivity increases the likelihood that adolescents and young adults will choose to wear earplugs when attending clubs or discotheques. This behavior can be referred to as an important "trigger" mechanism for the development of health-related behavior. Some general theories on health behavior are discussed to understand the role attitudes play for hearing prevention in young people. Finally, the finding that adolescents seeking professional help for tinnitus appear to have strong fears related to anxious thoughts and reactions associated with the condition is addressed. These fears can be a sign of a phobic reaction, something that most often first appears during adolescence. For these reasons, interdisciplinary research in the investigation of tinnitus distress and hearing conservation in young people seems to be the most relevant approach.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate potential health promotion variables associated with adolescents' hearing protection use at concerts. Study sample: The sample consisted of 242 upper secondary school students aged 15-19 years. Design(s): Variables defined by the theory of planned behaviour (TBP) and health belief model were tested in this quantitative study. Result(s): Fifty-three percent of the adolescents reported that they used hearing protection at concerts to some degree, and 33 individuals (14%) reported that they used hearing protection in 50% of cases or more. The average degree of hearing protection use was reported to be 17% of the visits at concerts. Norms, perceived control, barriers, and noise sensitivity were associated with attitudes towards loud music. In addition, norms, barriers, permanent tinnitus, and noise sensitivity were significantly correlated with hearing protection use. However, intention was not significantly correlated with hearing protection use. Conclusion(s): From a systems theoretical approach it can be suggested that preventive strategies must consider more levels than just the individual, in order to achieve long lasting behavioural changes in adolescents' listening habits. To be able to get useful knowledge about preventive strategies, it is necessary to add context-specific variables into generic models such as TPB. © 2013 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible gender differences regarding psychometric scales measuring risk perception in noisy situations, attitudes towards loud music, perceived susceptibility to noise, and individual norms and ideals related to activities where loud music is played. In addition the purpose was to analyze whether these variables are associated with protective behavior such as the use of hearing protection. A questionnaire was administered to a Swedish sample including 543 adolescents aged 16 to 20. The result revealed significant gender differences for all the psychometric scales. In addition, all psychometric measures were associated with hearing protection use in musical settings. Contrary to previous studies, gender did not contribute to any explanation of protective behavior by itself in the analysis. One conclusion is that although gender does not contribute by itself for the explanation of protective behavior, gender may affect psychological variables such as risk perception, attitudes and perceived susceptibility and that these variables may in turn be valuable for decision-making and protective behavior in noisy situations. Although women tend to be more 'careful' psychologically, they nevertheless tend to behave in the same way as men as regards actual noise-related risk taking.

AB  - Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of perceived hearing loss, tinnitus, and temporary threshold shift (TTS) in community college students and to see whether those students' attitudes toward noise affected their perception of their own possible hearing loss, tinnitus, and TTS. Method(s): Young adults (N = 245; age 18-27) completed 3 questionnaires: the Hearing Symptom Description, Youth Attitude to Noise Scale, and Adolescents' Habits and Hearing Protection Use. Result(s): Perceived TTS and pain associated with loud noise were the most common hearing related factors, followed by perceived tinnitus and hearing loss. The students' attitudes toward noise in their daily environment showed the most negative response, whereas attitudes toward noise and concentration indicated a more positive, or less harmful, response. Chi-square analysis indicated a significant correlation between perceived hearing loss and respondents' overall attitudes toward noise exposure. Hearing protection use was limited for all participants, with the majority reporting never having used hearing protection. Conclusion(s): Approximately 6% of respondents reported perceived hearing loss, and 13.5% reported prolonged tinnitus. In general, participants had neutral attitudes toward noise. Over 20% of participants reported ear pain, tinnitus, and/or TTS after noise exposure at least sometimes. Coincidentally, few participants reported consistent use of hearing protection. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the change in hearing-health behaviour amongst teenagers trained to deliver the Dangerous Decibels programme to younger children., DESIGN: The Dangerous Decibels programme uses a two-stage process to train 8-12 year-old children to protect their hearing from noise: (1) a team of experts train 'Educators' who (2) give classroom training to children in schools. Training teenagers as Educators may add a second level of benefit if teenagers internalize the hearing-health messages that they present and thus protect their own hearing better. They were assessed before training, immediately after, and three months later (after all had presented the classroom training) using a questionnaire. In addition, a focus group was conducted with a subgroup of the Educators to assess their subjective experience., STUDY SAMPLE: We trained 44 Educators aged 14-17 years., RESULTS: Results were generally positive: there were significant and sustained improvements in knowledge, self-reported behaviour, and perceived supports towards protecting hearing, and trends but not significant changes in attitudes or perceived barriers to hearing protection., CONCLUSIONS: Providing training to teenagers had benefits beyond the delivery of training to younger children, but improvements in the delivery model may increase the uptake and impact on the teenagers.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that collegiate level music students are exposed to potentially hazardous sound levels. Compared to professional musicians, collegiate level music students typically do not perform as frequently, but they are exposed to intense sounds during practice and rehearsal sessions. The purpose of the study was to determine the full-day exposure dose including individual practice and ensemble rehearsals for collegiate student musicians. Sixty-seven college students of classical music were recruited representing 17 primary instruments. Of these students, 57 completed 2 days of noise dose measurements using Cirrus doseBadge programed according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health criterion. Sound exposure was measured for 2 days from morning to evening, ranging from 7 to 9 h. Twenty-eight out of 57 (49%) student musicians exceeded a 100% daily noise dose on at least 1 day of the two measurement days. Eleven student musicians (19%) exceeded 100% daily noise dose on both days. Fourteen students exceeded 100% dose during large ensemble rehearsals and eight students exceeded 100% dose during individual practice sessions. Approximately, half of the student musicians exceeded 100% noise dose on a typical college schedule. This finding indicates that a large proportion of collegiate student musicians are at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss due to hazardous sound levels. Considering the current finding, there is a need to conduct hearing conservation programs in all music schools, and to educate student musicians about the use and importance of hearing protection devices for their hearing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most school-aged children experience exposure to hazardous sound levels via high-risk noise activities (e.g. loud music/concerts, firearms). Little information exists regarding factors influencing pediatric engagement in these activities and use of hearing protection devices. This study explores effects of age, gender, and attitudes toward noise on participation in acoustic risk-taking behaviors and hearing conservation practices in children and adolescents., DESIGN: Cross-sectional., STUDY SAMPLE: Children and adolescents (10-19 years) with normal hearing., RESULTS: Most children and adolescents (86.5%) participate in at least one potentially high-risk noise behavior. The most frequently cited activities include sporting events, concerts, and playing a musical instrument. Use of hearing protection devices varies by activity, with consistent wear while using firearms but inconsistent application during all other activities. Gender, but not age, influences acoustic risk-taking behaviors: Boys engage in significantly more high-risk noise activities than girls. Participants expressed a neutral attitude toward noise that persisted across age and gender, but a trend shifting toward a pro-noise attitude emerges in later adolescence., CONCLUSIONS: The proliferation of acoustic risk-taking behaviors and lack of hearing conservation practices in children and adolescents requires attention at an early age to prevent future noise-induced hearing loss and subsequent quality of life effects.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and related influencing factors in workers exposed to noise in a cement plant. Method(s): In October 2015, cluster sampling was used for questionnaire investigation and health examination of workers exposed to noise in a cement plant in Henan Province, China. The association of demographic features, living habits, cumulative noise exposure (CNE) , hypertension, and hyperlipidemia with NIHL was analyzed. Result(s): There was mainly medium-or high-frequency noise in the working place of this cement plant. The prevalence rate of NIHL was 18.4%, and male workers had a significantly higher prevalence rate than female workers (chi(2)=28.09, P<0.01) . The prevalence rate of NIHL increased with the increasing age (chi(2trend)=25.54, P<0.01) and decreasedwith the increasing degree of education (chi(2trend)=8.55, P<0.01) . The workers who smoked had a significantly higher prevalence rate of NIHL than those who did not smoke (chi(2)=14.15, P<0.01) , and the workers with a drinking habit had a significantly higher prevalence rate of NIHL than those without such habit (chi(2)=7.95, P<0.01) . The workers who did not wear earplugs had a significantly higher prevalence rate of NIHL than those who wore earplugs (chi(2)=19.93, P<0.01) . The prevalence rate of NIHL increased with the increasing CNE (chi(2trend)=57.81, P<0.01) . The workers with hyperlipidemiahad a significantly higher prevalence rate of NIHL than those without hyperlipidemia (chi(2)=12.43, P<0.01) . The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male sex (OR=5.06, 95%CI 1.68-15.26) , age >=50 years (OR=1.91, 95%CI 1.12-3.27) , CNE 97.01-103 dB (A) .year (OR=16.10, 95%CI 4.65-55.69) , CNE 103.01-118.37dB (A) .year (OR=20.27, 95%CI 5.14-79.92) , and hyperlipidemia (OR=2.83, 95%CI 1.25-6.43) were risk factors for NIHL, while high school education (OR=0.22, 95%CI 0.09-0.56) , junior college diploma (OR=0.16, 95%CI 0.41-0.59) , and use of earplugs (OR=0.36, 95%CI 0.19~0.71) were protective factors against NIHL. Conclusion(s): The workers in a cement plant have a high prevalence rate of NIHL, and CNE, sex, age, degree of education, use of earplugs, and hyperlipidemia may be influencing factors for NIHL.

AB  - Background/Aims: The purpose of this study is to explore the current situation of noise exposure, and the noise effect to the hearing of the cable manufacture workers. Method(s): This investigation includes the measurement of sound level in the workplace, personal noise dose, and hearing threshold of the workers, and questionnaire. The study included 241 workers of 2 cable factories. The exposure group includes 27 workers in packing section, 33 workers in copper wire drawing section, 43 workers in copper plating section, and 56 workers in tin-plating section, and 82 administrative staffs for the control group. Noise exposure group has 150 males and 9 females, and control group has 27 males and 55 females. Result(s): The measurement of environmental sound levels shows the average equivalent energy sound level (Leq) is respectively 92.3 dB-A of packing section, 87.0 dB-A of copper wire drawing section, 85.3 dB-A of copper plating section, 81.3 dB-A of tin plating section, and 59.4 dB-A of office. The personal noise dose (8-hour) averages of workers in the packing and copper wire drawing section are respectively 86.7% and 53.1%, they are the 2 most exposed sections and both go past the standard in Taiwan which the personal protective equipment and engineering improvement need to be provided. However, almost workers do not wear any hearing protectors in the sampling periods. To compare with the hearing threshold measured and the corresponding values of Taiwan's healthy people, it represents obviously raising hearing threshold in low frequency range. In particular, the workers in the copper wire drawing and copper plating sections are more significant. Moreover, in high frequency range, the workers in the packing and copper wire drawing sections show the more threshold shift. Conclusion(s): The sound level of exposure group is much higher than that of control group. Overall, the exposure group shows more abnormal hearing than that of control group. Besides the packing section workers in exposure group have higher abnormal hearing rate, and the workers in the copper wire drawing sections are the next.

AB  - Introduction: In order to investigate possible hearing loss as a consequence of aviation noise, a comparative analysis of audiometric data from Norwegian AirTraffic Control (ATC) personnel, airline (fixed-wing) pilots, and helicopter pilots was performed. The results may be of use in giving advice regarding preventive measures. Method(s): Male ATC, airline, and helicopter pilots were selected randomly from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) medical files. There were 182 subjects included in the study: 50, 81, and 51 subjects for ATC, helicopter, and airline pilots, respectively. Two audiograms with a 2-3-yr interval were analyzed for each individual. Age correction was performed using data from ISO 7129. Threshold changes per year for the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz were examined in particular after age correction. Results and Discussion: For all three groups, mean hearing threshold levels were above (worse than) ISO 7129 predictions for most frequencies. As expected, hearing thresholds increased with age in the group as a whole. Looking at the 3-, 4-, and 6-kHz frequencies in particular, all groups had small but highly significant increases in hearing thresholds at 4 kHz between the first and second audiogram. Conclusion(s): The mean hearing thresholds for this group of aviation personnel are higher than International Standard ISO-7129 would predict according to age. Highly significant changes in hearing threshold after age correction, indicating possible noise-induced hearing loss, were found in all groups at 4 kHz. The fact that helicopter pilots had similar hearing loss to their other aviation colleagues indicates that current hearing protection for these pilots is effective in counteracting the increased noise levels in helicopters.

AB  - This paper presents a field-microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) method for the objective measurement of individual earplug field attenuation. This development was made possible by using a recently designed instrumented expandable custom earplug. From the measurement of the noise reduction (NR) through the earplug, this method predicts the attenuation that would be experienced by the wearer and that would be measured using the real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) method. Formulations presented include establishing the relationship between NR, insertion loss, and REAT, as well as defining the laboratory and field calibration procedures required to determine the correction factors to be applied to the measured NR. This method was validated experimentally by comparing the predicted field-MIRE attenuation values to the REAT values measured on a group of test-subjects. This method offers fast and accurate measurement of earplug field performance on an individual basis and could lead to further developments for effective hearing protection practices as well as for hearing protection device rating and labeling. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - While hearing protection devices (HPD) have been the last and often only line of defense against noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace, their performance has been suspect. Laboratory evaluations have not proven to predict the actual performance of HPD in the field. Individual fit testing of HPD will allow the determination of HPD performance on individual workers, and this will improve the ability to select HPD appropriate for given noise exposures and intervene with workers to ensure sufficiency in HPD performance. A modified microphone-in-real-ear (F-MIRE) has been adapted to test a variety of HPD quickly and reliably in situ. A dual-element microphone and software combination permits reliable noise reduction measurements. Statistically developed compensation factors permit direct comparison of F-MIRE predicted personal attenuation ratings to traditional laboratory measures of HPD performance using real-ear-attenuation-at-threshold assessments.

AB  - Purpose: to evaluate the influence of bone-conduction in the MR environment compared to a standardized acoustic environment. Material(s) and Method(s): Acoustic noise is an unwanted side effect of MRI that is commonly tackled with passive hearing protection. In an MR scanner, however, with the patient completely surrounded by the MR sounds and in close contact with the vibrating MR table and gantry, bone-conduction may increase subjective sound levels, restricting the efficacy of passive protection that reduces air-conducted noise only. A total of 10 volunteers were subjected to pure MR tones, covering the frequency range relevant for hearing and at 60 dB, generated through the MR system's gradient coils. Bone-conduction was determined for various passive damping conditions in an MR scanner and was compared to that acquired in an acoustically-calibrated environment. The contribution of mechanical vibrations to bone-conduction was determined. Also, with a microphone in the ear canal, the objective efficacy of the passive protection was measured. Result(s): We found no difference between the bone-conduction experiments executed inside the imager and in the acoustically-controlled environment. The overall insertion loss of the passive hearing protectors was over 20 dB with strongest effects at 0.4 and 2.5 kHz. Conclusion(s): As bone-conduction is not more pronounced inside the MR scanner than outside, the previous reports on the subjective evaluation of protection devices in MRI hold their validity. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - There is an increasing population at risk of hearing loss and tinnitus due to increasing high-volume music listening. To inform prevention strategies and interventions, this study aimed to identify important protection motivation theory-based constructs as well as the constructs 'consideration of future consequences' and 'habit strength' as correlates of adolescents' unsafe discotheque-visiting behavior. We invited 1687 adolescents (12-19 years old) at Dutch secondary schools to complete questionnaires about music-listening behaviors, sociodemographic characteristics and psychosocial determinants of behavior. Over 70% of participants reported to have visited discotheques; 24.6% of them were categorized as visitors at risk for hearing loss due to estimated exposure of 100 dBA for 1.25 hours per week or more without the use of hearing protection. Compared with visitors not at risk for hearing loss, those at risk were more likely not to live with both parents and less likely to consider future consequences and for them visiting high-volume music discotheques was more habitual. Risky exposure to high-volume music in discotheques is associated with several sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with habit strength being the strongest correlate. Voluntary behavior change among adolescents might be difficult to achieve, because visiting discotheques seems to be strongly linked to current adolescent lifestyle.

AB  - Objectives: This descriptive summary of the literature provides an overview of the available studies (published before October 2006) on sociodemographic, psychosocial, and other correlates of risk and protective behaviors for hearing loss in young people aged 12 to 25 years. Method(s): Publications were identified by a structured search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, and by scrutinizing the reference lists of relevant articles. The protection motivation theory was used as the theoretical framework for categorizing the psychosocial correlates. Result(s): Thirty-three papers were included that identified several sociodemographic and psychosocial correlates, such as age, gender, school level, ethnicity, music preference, physical activity, social influence, and free supply of hearing protection. Conclusion(s): For the development of effective interventions we recommend theory-based longitudinal studies among those frequently exposed to loud music to assess these correlates in greater depth. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the New South Wales Rural Hearing Conservation Program on the implementation of personal hearing protection (PHP) and noise management strategies among farmers who had participated in this program in New South Wales, Australia. A follow-up survey of a random sample of people screened through the New South Wales Rural Hearing Conservation Program was linked to their baseline data. The use of PHP at baseline was compared to use at follow-up in four specific scenarios: use with non-cabbed tractors, with chainsaws, with firearms, and in workshops. For non-cabbed tractors, the net gain in PHP use was 13.3%; the net gain was 20.8% for chainsaws, 6.7% for fire-arms, and 21.3% for workshops. Older farmers and those with a family history of hearing loss were less likely to maintain or improve PHP use. Those with severe hearing loss, males, and participants reporting hearing problems in situations where background noise was present were more likely to maintain or improve PHP use. Forty-one percent of farmers had initiated other strategies to reduce noise exposure beyond the use of PHP, which included engineering, maintenance, and noise avoidance solutions. The early (hopefully) identification of hearing deficit in farmers and farm workers can help promote behavior change and help reinforce a farm culture that supports hearing conservation. The continuation and expansion of hearing screening programs such as these should be encouraged as basic public health strategy in farming communities. © ASABE.

AB  - Acoustical test fixtures (ATFs) are currently used to measure the attenuation of the earplugs. Several authors pointed out that the presence of an artificial skin layer inside the cylindrical ear canal of the ATFs strongly influenced the attenuation measurements. In this paper, this role is investigated via a 2D axisymmetric finite element model of a silicon earplug coupled to an artificial skin. The model is solved using COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL(), Sweden) and validated experimentally. The model is exploited thereafter to better understand the role of each part of the earplug/ear canal system and how the energy circulates within the domains. This is investigated by calculating power balances and by representing the mechanical and acoustical fluxes in the system. The important dissipative role of the artificial skin is underlined and its contribution as a sound transmission pathway is quantified. In addition, the influence of both the earplug and the artificial skin parameters is assessed via sensitivities analyses performed on the model.

AB  - The axisymmetric hypothesis of the earplug-ear canal system geometry is commonly used. The validity of this hypothesis is investigated numerically in the case of a simplified configuration where the system is embedded in a rigid baffle and for fixed boundary conditions on the earplug lateral walls. This investigation is discussed for both individual and averaged insertion loss predictions of molded silicon earplugs. The insertion losses of 15 earplug-ear canal systems with realistic geometries are calculated using three-dimensional (3D) finite element models and compared with the insertion losses provided by two-dimensional equivalent axisymmetric finite element models using 6 different geometry reconstruction methods [all the models are solved using COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL, Sweden)]. These methods are then compared in order to find the most reliable ones in terms of insertion loss predictions in this simplified configuration. Two methods have emerged: The usage of a variable cross section (with the same area values as the 3D case) or the usage of a constant cross section (with the same length and volume as the 3D case).

AB  - Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing impairment. Little is known about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions. To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH update to 25 January 2012. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical hearing loss prevention interventions under field conditions among workers exposed to noise. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We included 25 studies. We found no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure but one study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis. Eight studies with 3,430 participants evaluated immediate and long-term effects of personal hearing protection devices (HPDs) and sixteen studies with 82,794 participants evaluated short and long-term effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). The overall quality of studies was low to very low.The one ITS study that evaluated the effect of new legislation in reducing noise exposure found that the median noise level decreased by 27.7 dB(A) (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 dB) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation and that this was associated with a favourable downward trend in time of -2.1 dB per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7).Hearing protection devices attenuated noise with about 20 dB(A) with variation among brands and types but for ear plugs these findings depended almost completely on proper instruction of insertion. Noise attenuation ratings of hearing protection under field conditions were consistently lower than the ratings provided by the manufacturers.One cluster-RCT compared a three-year information campaign as part of a hearing loss prevention programme for agricultural students to audiometry only with three and 16-year follow-up but there were no significant differences in hearing loss. Another study compared a HLPP, which provided regular personal noise exposure information, to a programme without this information in a CBA design. Exposure information was associated with a favourable but non-significant reduction of the rate of hearing loss of -0.82 dB per year (95% CI -1.86 to 0.22). Another cluster-RCT evaluated the effect of extensive on-site training sessions and the use of personal noise-level indicators versus information only on noise levels but did not find a significant difference after four months follow-up (Mean Difference (MD) -0.30 dB(A) (95%CI -3.95 to 3.35).There was very low quality evidence in four very long-term studies, that better use of HPDs as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs. Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect.In four long-term studies, workers in a HLPP still had a 0.5 dB greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than workers that were not exposed to noise (95% CI -0.5 to 1.7) which is about the level of hearing loss caused by exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, two other studies showed substantial risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non-exposed workers. There is low quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Even though case studies show that substantial reductions in noise levels in the workplace can be achieved, there are no controlled studies of the effectiveness of such measures. The effectiveness of hearing protection devices depends on training and their proper use. There is very low quality evidence that the better use of hear ng protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. Better implementation and reinforcement of HLPPs is needed. Better evaluations of technical interventions and long-term effects are needed.

AB  - The objectives of the present study were to (i) estimate noise levels at major traffic junctions in Bengaluru City, and (ii) assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of traffic policemen deputed at those junctions towards the auditory effects caused by noise pollution. The present questionnaire based study was carried among 60 traffic policemen. Road traffic noise was measured at different places in Bengaluru city using Sound level meter and it ranged from 71.2 to 91 dB. The questionnaire included the questions regarding the self assessment of the policemen about their hearing ability, past and present exposure to loud sound and the use of personal protective devices such as ear plugs and ear muffs. The questionnaire was filled by the subjects and the data was analyzed. The mean age was 42.2+/-7.4 years and the mean year of exposure was 10.82+/-8.53 yrs. Only 3.33% of the subjects felt that their hearing ability was below average. Thirteen subjects reported that they usually missed some conversation over phone while 25% reported similar condition while talking to someone in crowd. 16.66% had work related tinnitus (> once a day) and experienced it more during working hours. None of them used ear plugs/ ear muffs and the reason for non-usage was nonavailability (100%). The self assessment of hearing by traffic policemen suggests that most of the traffic policemen have normal hearing. However, a systematic study with Audiometry of these subjects is recommended.

AB  - Background and objectives:Previous research showed an increase of noise-induced symptoms in adolescents. Permanent tinnitus as a consequence of loud music exposure is usually considered as noise-induced damage. The objective was to perform an epidemiological study in order to obtain prevalence data of permanent noise-induced tinnitus as well as temporary tinnitus following noise exposure in a young population. In addition the attitudes and beliefs towards noise and hearing protection were evaluated in order to explain the use/non-use of hearing protection in a young population. Method(s):A questionnaire was completed by 3892 high school students (mean age: 16.64 years old, SD: 1.29 years). The prevalence of temporary and permanent tinnitus was assessed. In addition the 'Youth Attitudes to Noise Scale' and the 'Beliefs About Hearing Protection and Hearing Loss' were used in order to assess the attitudes and beliefs towards noise and hearing protection respectively. Result(s):The prevalence of temporary noise-induced tinnitus and permanent tinnitus in high school students was respectively 74.9% and 18.3%. An increasing prevalence of temporary tinnitus with age was present. Most students had a 'neutral attitude' towards loud music and the use of hearing protection was minimal (4.7%). The limited use of hearing protection is explained by a logistic regression analysis showing the relations between certain parameters and the use of hearing protection. Conclusion(s):Despite the very high prevalence of tinnitus in such a young population, the rate of hearing protection use and the knowledge about the risks of loud music is extremely low. Future preventive campaigns should focus more on tinnitus as a warning signal for noise-induced damage and emphasize that also temporary symptoms can result in permanent noise-induced damage. © 2013 Gilles et al.

AB  - Background: During helicopter rescue operations the medical personnel are at high risk for hearing damage by noise exposure. There are two important factors to be taken into account: first, the extreme variability, with some days involving no exposure but other days with extreme exposure; second, the extreme noise levels during work outside the helicopter, e.g. during winch operations. The benefit of modern, less noisier constructions and the consequences for noise protection are still unknown. Objective(s): We estimated the noise exposure of the personnel for different helicopter types used during rescue operations in the Alps and in other regions of the world with special regard to the advanced types like Eurocopter EC 135 to compare the benefit of modern constructions for noise protection with earlier ones. Method(s): The rescue operations over 1 year of four rescue bases in the Alps (Raron and Zermatt in Switzerland; Landeck and Innsbruck in Austria, n = 2731) were analyzed for duration of rescue operations (noise exposure). Noise levels were measured during rescue operations at defined points inside and outside the different aircraft. The setting is according to the European standard (Richtlinie 2003/10/EG Amtsblatt) and to Class 1 DIN/IEC 651. With both data sets the equivalent noise level Leq8h was calculated. For comparison it was assumed that all rescue operations were performed with a specific type of helicopter. Then model calculations for noise exposure by different helicopter types, such as Alouette IIIb, Alouette II 'Lama', Ecureuil AS350, Bell UH1D, Eurocopter EC135, and others were performed. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Depending on modern technologies the situation for the personnel has been improved significantly. Nevertheless noise prevention, which includes noise intermissions in spare time, is essential. Medical checks of the crews by occupational medicine (e.g. 'G20' in Germany) are still mandatory. © The Author 2012.

AB  - Several studies have focused on the potential impact of children's hearing loss on learning and development. Recently, numerous teenage students have been found to be fond of listening to music on personal devices and participating in recreational music activities. The objective of this study was to investigate teenage students' hearing impairment, their experience with recreational noise exposure, and their self-reported hearing. The participants were 1878 first-year students at a university in Taiwan. The result of the pure tone audiometry test showed that 11.9% of the participants had one or two ears with a hearing threshold over 25. dB. Over the past year, approximately 80.9% of the participants had taken part in at least one loud-noise recreational activity, and 90.9% of the participants were in the habit of using earphones. Among the participants, 190 students with a high level of recreational noise exposure were assigned to the exposure group, and 191 students with a low level of recreational noise exposure constituted the control group. The exposure group had more hearing problems than the control group, but no significant difference existed between the two groups in the pure tone audiometry test (p= 0.857). It is suggested that the schools should reinforce hearing health education and proactively provide intervention measures, such as hearing tests, evaluation of noise exposure, and hearing protection. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The U.S. Donor Hemovigilance System (DHV) was developed through a public/private collaboration between the US Dept. HHS and the private blood banks coordinated by AABB. Software, developed by KBSI, Inc., and designed by AABB's Donor Hemovigilance Working Group captures both numerator and denominator data on adverse events in blood donors in the US. Coffee Memorial Blood Center (CMBC) served as one of the three pilot centers. Initial benchmarking among the three pilot centers confirmed higher rates of Loss of Consciousness(LOC) in young donors, and demonstrated that rates of LOC varied among the pilot centers, with LOC rates at CMBC double or triple those of the other pilot centers. Aim(s): To use the DHV to establish the relative effectiveness of implemented at CMBC to reduce LOC reactions in young donors relative to baseline. Method(s): Three years of data were analyzed, from July 2009 through June 2012. Three comparison periods were identified for sequential introduction of interventions. Comparison Periods: July 2009 - June 2010: Establishing baseline rates July 2010 - June 2011: Interventions implemented included education with printed materials and video for all high school blood drives, hydration (8 oz water), salty snacks for post-donation recover and use of applied muscle tension(AMT) July 2011 - June 2012: Restriction of blood donation to donors with a calculated blood volume of >3500 cc. Result(s): Reports were generated using the DHV, using canned and custom analysis reports. All needle in donations (N = 77,178) between July 2009 and June 2012 were included in the analysis with 282 LOC events, complicated, uncomplicated or with injury (overall rate of 3.7/1000 donations). We performed a two-sample test of proportions comparing each period's LOC rate to the baseline period by age groups. Compared to baseline, LOC rates from July 2010 to June 2011 were not statistically significant across various age groups. Comparing July 2011-June 2012 rates to the baseline, there was an overall statistically significant decrease in LOC rates (4.8-2.3) with P < 0.001. There was significant decrease in LOC rates across the younger groups (<23) and among the 30s and the 50s age groups. Summary: The implementation of education, hydration, (AMT) and salty snacks reduced LOC rates in donor aged 19-22, (12.6/1000-6.4/1000) but appeared to have no effect on the youngest donors in the 16-18 age group. Restriction of donation to donors with a blood volume >3500 cc made a larger difference for the very youngest donor group, reducing rates from 16.6/1000 to 7.9/1000. Since this study mea sured incremental improvement, we are unable to determine the effect that blood volume restriction without the added measures of education, hydration, AMT and salty snacks would have had. Conclusion(s): Use of the US DHV program enabled CMBC to quantify the effectiveness of incrementally implemented interventions to reduce LOC reactions in young donors and demonstrated highest benefit derived from requirement of a minimum BV. This software will enable the center to donor events and interventions in the same manner. (Table presented).

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of traffic policemen towards the health effects caused by noise pollution. Material(s) and Method(s): The present questionnaire-based study was carried out among 86 traffic policemen randomly selected for an awareness workshop for prevention of noise pollution. The questionnaire included questions regarding the self-assessment of the policemen about their hearing ability, past and present exposure to loud sound and the use of personal protective devices such as earplugs and earmuffs. The questionnaire was filled up by the subjects. The data analysis was carried out using Epi Info 3.3.2 and included calculation of percentages and proportions and application of the test of significance. Result(s): The mean age was 39.2 +/- 7.8 years and the mean years of exposure was 2.1 +/- 1.8 years. Only 2.3% of the subjects felt that their hearing ability was below average. 11.6% complained of regular tinnitus, while 62.8% had work-related tinnitus and experienced it during working hours only. Only 4.7% used earplugs and that too, very seldom. Reasons for non-usage of earplugs/earmuffs included non-availability (65.1%), discomfort (11.6%), bad fit (2.3%), personal dislike (16.3%) and headache caused by its use (4.7%). 67.4% subjects did not use any method to reduce exposure to noise, while remaining used fingers, hands and cotton to avoid noise exposure. Conclusion(s): The self-assessment of hearing by traffic policemen suggests that most of the traffic policemen have normal hearing. However, a systematic study with audiometry of these subjects is recommended.

AB  - To determine the postoperative incidence, extent and recurrence rate of exostoses of the external auditory canal in a cohort of patients involved in different water sports. A cross-sectional study of 31 patients (46 ears), with exostoses treated by surgery in the Royal Cornwall Hospital between 1980 and 1999. A questionnaire was used to obtain information about the type of water exposure pre- and postoperatively. The extent of recurrent stenosis was assessed. The mean postoperative time interval was 10 years (SD = 4.5 years). The degree of stenosis was assessed as: minimal (<30%) in 42.6%, moderate (30-60%) in 31% and severe (>60%) in 25% of ears. The Cox regression model was used to identify factors associated with a reduction in the recurrence rate of stenosis. The use of ear plugs was highly significant (P = 0.015), as was the age of the patient at the time of operation (P = 0.004), i.e. the older the patient, the faster recurrent disease developed. There was no evidence to show that either the type or seasonal pattern of water sport activity influenced recurrence of the disease postoperatively, although preoperatively, the stenosis was more marked in association with surfing and sailing. Exostoses developed faster preoperatively in those who were in the water all year round rather than just the summer months. Of five patients who stopped water sport activity completely after surgery, four of them developed significant recurrent exostoses (>50% stenosis).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to record and compare audiometric pure tone thresholds of dental clinicians (DCs), dental professionals (DPs), and dental students (DSs); determine the percentage of these groups who use hearing protection devices while at work in the clinic; and measure the sound intensities generated by a few representative high-speed handpieces while they are being used on patients. Participants included DCs who regularly used these handpieces (n = 16), DPs who did not use these handpieces (n = 13), and DSs (n = 8). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic information, assess occupational and recreational noise exposure, and note the level of hearing protection used. A sound level meter was used to measure the sound intensity generated by dental instruments near a clinician's ear. Results showed that DCs who regularly used high-speed handpieces had worse hearing than did members of the other study groups. These results indicate that the implementation of protective strategies should help to reduce the prevalence of occupational hearing loss among DCs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Workers with hearing loss face special problems, especially when working in noise. However, conventional hearing conservation practices do not distinguish between workers with normal hearing versus impaired hearing. This study collected information from workers with self-reported noise exposure and hearing loss, supervisors of such workers, and hearing conservation program managers through focus groups and in-depth interviews to evaluate their perspectives on the impact of hearing loss on safety and job performance, the use of hearing protection, and information needed to appropriately manage hearing-impaired workers who work in noisy environments. RESULT(S): Concerns about working in noise with a hearing loss could be grouped into the following 10 categories: impact on job performance, impact on job safety, impaired ability to hear warning signals, impaired ability to monitor equipment, interference with communication, stress and/or fatigue, impaired communication caused by hearing protector use, reduced ability to monitor the environment as the result of hearing protector use, concerns about future quality of life, and concerns about future employability. Mostly, there was an agreement between the perceptions of workers, supervisors, and hearing conservation program managers regarding difficulties associated with hearing loss and consequent needs. These findings suggest that noise-exposed workers with hearing loss face many of the same problems reported in the literature by noise-exposed workers with normal hearing, with additional concerns primarily about job safety as the result of a reduced ability to hear environmental sounds, warning signals, and so forth. CONCLUSION(S): The study outlines potential challenges regarding job safety and hearing conservation practices for noise-exposed, hearing-impaired workers. Awareness of these issues is a necessary first step toward providing appropriate protective measures for noise-exposed, hearing-impaired workers. Copyright © 2005 by the United States Government.

AB  - To determine effect of noise block using earplugs on reducing propofol infusion needed to maintain a constant bispectral index (BIS) values in patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Fifty-eight patients (18-65 years) with nephrolithiasis undergoing ESWL, having ASA physical status I or II and have normal hearing function tested by audiometry were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Patients were randomized and allocated into two groups: noise blocked group (earplugs inserted into both ears) and control group (earplugs not inserted). Sedation by target-controlled infusion was started with 1.2 mcg/mL of propofol and propofol target concentration was adjusted gradually by 0.2 mcg/ml every 5 minutes intraoperatively to achieve and maintain bispectral index (BIS) values within 75-80% until the procedure finished. Total amount of propofol (mg), BIS values (%), ambient noise level (dB) and patient satisfaction (1-5) were measured. The amount of propofol infusion needed to maintain a constant BIS index value in patients undergoing ESWL in the noise blocked group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.91 +/- 2.05 vs. 8.23 +/- 2.16 mg/kg/m2/hr, p = 0.021). Patient satisfaction was similar in both groups (4 [1] vs. 4 [1], p = 0.929). Noise diminution in ambient operating room can reduce the amount of propofol needed to maintain light sedation during ESWL.

AB  - Background: According to International Labor Organization (ILO), occupational accidents and work-related diseases are the causes for millions of deaths of workers every year. In addition, many millions of workers suffer non-fatal injuries and illnesses. This research was conceived with aim to assess safety practices and associated factors among employees of Dashen brewery Share Company, Ethiopia. Method(s): Institutionalbased cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the level of self-reported safety practice and associated factors from February to March 2016, among Dashen brewery workers. Stratified sampling method was employed to select 415 study participants and the data was collected by using structured interview-administer questionnaire. Observational checklist was also used to ascertain the response given by interviewee. Result(s): Fourhundred 15 respondent were involved in this study. Of those individuals, almost three fourth (74.2%) of the participants were male and 43.4% of participants were single. Mean (SD) age of respondents were 28.18 (+/-8.67) years and half of the respondents (49.9%) were diploma holders. The finding of this study indicated that 87.2% of the respondents reported complying with good safety practice. Age, marital status, employment status, attitude, safety and health training, and management support were found to be main predictors for safety practices. Conclusion(s): The level of self-reported safety practice in this study was good. Management commitment on safety and training of the employees about safety and health is very important and should be provided regularly.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community noise exposure has been shown to increase the risk of hypertension; however, the relationship between occupational noise exposure and hypertension is less clear., METHODS: Using an inception cohort of workers in a specialty metals manufacturing company, we retrospectively assessed occupational noise exposure, hearing acuity, and incident hypertension diagnoses using administrative datasets. Time-weighted average noise exposure levels were assigned to employees based on their job histories. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to determine the association of noise exposure with risk of incident hypertension., RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of incident hypertension did not significantly differ between groups by cumulative continuous or categorized noise exposure metric., CONCLUSION: We found no increased risk of incident hypertension with exposure to occupational noise among workers. Further assessment examining workers' use of hearing protection devices is warranted.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Previous publications have suggested that prolonged exposure to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may lead to hearing damage and that hearing protection should be used. We sought to determine the auditory risk associated with ESWL in regard to patients and operating room personnel in a contemporary setting. Method(s): A single day study was performed during which 5 patients were treated with ESWL via a Dornier Compact Delta lithotripter (Dornier MedTech America Inc, Kennesaw, Georgia). A sound level meter was used to evaluate the noise exposure to the patient, ESWL technician, anesthesia personnel, and the treating urologist. Multiple readings were taken at each station and during each treatment session while the patient was treated at maximum intensity level. These recordings were then averaged and referenced to published Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. Result(s): The greatest level of noise exposure was found to be at the head of the patient, with an average reading of 89 decibels (dB). The readings at the lithotripter technician's station averaged 84 dB. The anesthetist and urologist were exposed to average sound levels of 81 and 79 dB, respectively. All readings at each evaluated station evidenced a level of exposure considered safe by OSHA standards, which permit 8 hours of exposure to 90 dB per day. Conclusion(s): Contemporary ESWL does not pose a significant auditory hazard to either the patient or operating room personnel by OSHA standards. Thus, in reference to these standards, hearing protection for the parties involved is not considered mandatory. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is growing interest in combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG). Because TMS pulses are accompanied by a clicking sound, it is very likely that part of the response in the EEG consists of an auditory evoked potential (AEP). Different methods have been applied to mask the sound of TMS. However, it is unclear which masking method is most effective in reducing the AEP. In this study we explore the presumed contribution of the AEP to the response and evaluate different ways to mask the TMS clicking sound. Twelve healthy subjects and one completely deaf subject participated in this study. Eight different masking conditions were evaluated in nine hearing subjects. The amplitude of the N100-P180 complex was compared between the different masking conditions. We were not able to completely suppress the N100-P180 when the coil was placed on top of the head. Using an earmuff or exposing the subjects to white or adapted noise caused a small but significant reduction in N100-P180 amplitude, but the largest reduction was achieved when combining a layer of foam, placed between coil and head, with white or adapted noise. The deaf subject also showed a N100-P180 complex. We conclude that both the TMS clicking sound and cortical activation by the magnetic pulse contribute to the N100-P180 amplitude.

AB  - Excessive exposure to high noise level environments has the potential to cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), and cigarette smoking has also been shown to have a potential adverse effect on hearing. The aim of this study was to determine whether smoking interacts with noise in the development of hearing loss, and if so, the extent of the contribution from smoking on NIHL. A cross-sectional study was designed to assess the effect of smoking on NIHL in 517 male workers (non-smokers: N = 199; smokers: N = 318) exposed to a high-level industrial noise environment in China. Shift-long temporal waveforms of the noise that workers were exposed to for evaluation of noise exposures, and audiometric threshold measures were obtained on all selected subjects. The subjects used hearing protection devices only within the last 1-2 years. The results suggest that smoking has an adverse effect on NIHL in workers exposed to high level industrial noise, i.e., the median high frequency hearing thresholds were significantly greater in smokers than non-smokers exposed to noise for more than 10 years. This effect was observed at 4.0 and 6.0 kHz. Smoking did not have an adverse effect on NIHL in workers exposed to noise less than 10 years. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the odds ratio (OR) for high frequency hearing loss (i.e., hearing threshold greater than 40 dB at 4.0 kHz) were 1.94 for smokers in comparison to non-smokers. The results suggest that: (1) smokers have a higher risk of developing high frequency hearing loss than non-smokers with a similar occupational noise exposure, and (2) the interaction between cigarette smoking and high-level noise exposure may be additive. There is a need to develop and analyze a larger database of workers with well-documented exposures and smoking histories for better understanding of the effect of smoking on NIHL incurred from high-level industrial noise exposures. A better understanding of the role of smoking may lead to its incorporation into hearing risk assessment for noise exposure.

AB  - This study used an ecological model to examine Thai workers' beliefs and attitudes toward using occupational hearing protection. Data collection involved focus group sessions with 28 noise-exposed workers at four factories in Chiang Mai Province and an interview with a safety officer at each organization. Detailed content analysis resulted in the identification of three types of factors influencing the use of hearing protection: intrapersonal, including preventing impaired hearing, noise annoyance, personal discomfort, and interference with communication; interpersonal, including coworker modeling, supervisor support, and supervisor modeling; and organizational, including organizational rules and regulations, provision of hearing protection devices, dissemination of knowledge and information, noise monitoring, and hearing testing. Effective hearing protection programs depend on knowledge of all of these factors. Strategies to promote workers' use of hearing protection should include the complete range of factors having the potential to affect workers' hearing.

AB  - Promoting the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) can prevent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among workers who are exposed to excessive noise. In the present study, the authors examine factors that may explain HPD use among industrial workers from 15 manufacturing plants in Thailand. Participants consisted of 268 randomly selected workers exposed to harmful noise levels for which routine HPD use was required. Logistic regression analysis of study variables revealed the most powerful predictors of HPD use were perceived hearing status ( b = 0.66, p < .001) and interpersonal factors (i.e., role modeling and interpersonal support; b = 0.20, p < .001). Together, these variables correctly classified 63.4% of the cases. These findings have implications for interventions aimed at motivating workers to use HPDs regularly.

AB  - High acoustic noise level is one of the unavoidable side effects of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A case of hearing loss after 3 T MRI has been reported in this institution and hence this study. The objective of this study was to determine whether temporary threshold shift (TTS) in high frequency hearing occurs in patients undergoing 3 T MRI scans of the head and neck. A total of 35 patients undergoing head and neck 3 T MRI for various clinical indications were tested with pure tone audiometry in different frequencies including high frequencies, before and after the MRI scan. Any threshold change from the recorded baseline of 10 dB was considered significant. All patients were fitted with foamed 3 M earplugs before the procedure following the safety guidelines for 3 T MRI. The mean time for MRI procedure was 1,672 s (range 1,040-2,810). The noise dose received by each patient amounted to an average of 3,906.29 % (1,415-9,170 %). The noise dose was derived from a normograph used by Occupational Noise Surveys. This was calculated using the nomograph of Leq, LEX, noise dose and time. There was no statistically significant difference between the hearing threshold before and after the MRI procedures for all the frequencies (paired t test, P > 0.05). For patients using 3 M foamed earplugs, noise level generated by 3 T MRI during routine clinical sequence did not cause any TTS in high frequency hearing.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the actual situation of noise and low-frequency sounds in firework events and their impact on pyrotechnicians., METHODS: Data on firework noise and low-frequency sounds were obtained at a point located approximately 100 m away from the launch site of a firework display held in "A" City in 2013. We obtained the data by continuously measuring and analyzing the equivalent continuous sound level (Leq) and the one-third octave band of the noise and low-frequency sounds emanating from the major firework detonations, and predicted sound levels at the original launch site., RESULTS: Sound levels of 100-115 dB and low-frequency sounds of 100-125 dB were observed at night. The maximum and mean Leq values were 97 and 95 dB, respectively. The launching noise level predicted from the sounds (85 dB) at the noise measurement point was 133 dB. Occupational exposure to noise for pyrotechnicians at the remote operation point (located 20-30 m away from the launch site) was estimated to be below 100 dB., CONCLUSIONS: Pyrotechnicians are exposed to very loud noise (>100 dB) at the launch point. We believe that it is necessary to implement measures such as fixing earplugs or earmuffs, posting a warning at the workplace, and executing a remote launching operation to prevent hearing loss caused by occupational exposure of pyrotechnicians to noise. It is predicted that both sound levels and low-frequency sounds would be reduced by approximately 35 dB at the remote operation site.

AB  - Purpose: Hearing is an important sense for physicians, making communication and stethoscope use possible, yet not much is known about the impact of hearing loss on professional function. The purpose of this study was to explore hearing-related issues affecting physicians. Material(s) and Method(s): We administered a hearing test and questionnaire to 107 physicians and medical students. Result(s): The proportion of physicians reporting trouble with their hearing increased with age, reaching almost 100% in those older than 60 years. Audiometric hearing loss also increased with age. Perceived hearing trouble was significantly associated with audiometric hearing loss, yet 46% of physicians with hearing loss described their hearing as good. Older physicians more frequently reported difficulty communicating with patients, staff, and colleagues owing to hearing problems (P = .007). Reported stethoscope difficulties did not significantly increase with age; there was no association with hearing thresholds. No physician reported use of electronic stethoscopes or hearing aids. Noise exposures were common, yet 51% of respondents never used hearing protection. Younger physicians were less likely to use protection (P = .002). Conclusion(s): Physicians lose hearing with age but may not notice or report the loss. Physician hearing loss is associated with difficulty communicating with patients, staff, and colleagues. Neither age nor hearing level predicts problems with stethoscope use; possible explanations include a training effect or denial. Many physicians, especially younger ones, never use hearing protection around noise. Strategies to recognize and reduce the impact of hearing loss on professional function throughout a physician's career deserve greater attention.

AB  - Objectives. To determine (i) noise exposure levels of spectators at a FIFA 2010 designated training stadium during a premier soccer league match; and (ii) changes in auditory functioning after the match. Methods. This was a one-group pretest-post-test design of football spectators attending a premier soccer league match at a designated FIFA 2010 training stadium in Gauteng, South Africa. Individual spectator noise exposure for the duration of the football match and post-match changes in hearing thresholds were measured with pure-tone audiometry, and cochlear functioning was measured with distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Results. The average sound exposure level during the match was 100.5 LAeq (dBA), with peak intensities averaging 140.4 dB(C). A significant (p=0.005) deterioration of post-match hearing thresholds was evident at 2 000 Hz, and post-match DPOAE amplitudes were significantly reduced at 1 266, 3 163 and 5 063 Hz (p=0.011, 0.019, 0.013, respectively). Conclusions. Exposure levels exceeded limits of permissible average and peak sound levels. Significant changes in post-match hearing thresholds and cochlear responsiveness highlight the possible risk for noise-induced hearing loss. Public awareness and personal hearing protection should be prioritised as preventive measures.

AB  - It has been twenty-five years since the final version of the Hearing Conservation Amendment was issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor. Since that time, some things have changed and others have stayed exactly the same. Certainly the noise-exposed workforce is more knowledgeable about the hazards of noise, and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) has greatly increased. There have been significant strides in the technology for measuring noise and for protecting hearing through HPDs. But there is considerable room for improvement. Some of the noise regulation's provisions are embarrassingly outdated, some are in dire need of improvement, and others, such as the requirements for engineering noise control, are not being enforced. Sadly, there seems to be little progress in reducing overall noise exposure levels. What needs to be done at this point is a major overhaul of the noise regulation: recommitment to engineering noise control; reduction of the permissible exposure limit (PEL) to 85 dBA; a shift to the 3-dBA exchange rate; and a nationwide assessment of hearing loss in American workers to determine the effectiveness of current hearing conservation measures to identify and address the weaknesses in programs and regulations.

AB  - PURPOSE: Dental technicians are exposed to different noises. The aim of this study was to determine the noise level produced by different dental laboratory handpieces and special equipments in one dental lab., METHODS: The noise level produced by two dental laboratory handpieces(Kavo K9, NSK Vmax) was measured at distance of 15cm, 30cm and 45cm in free-running and different working conditions. Additionally, the noise level produced by some dental laboratory equipments and procedures were also measured both near the technician's ear and 1.5 meters away. The noise level was determined using a precious sound level meter., RESULTS: The mean value of noise level of the two dental laboratory handpieces measured at all distances and in all conditions was between 61 to 83 dB. The noise level produced by some dental laboratory equipments were much higher, with high-speed metal cutting, steam cleaning and power pillo trimmer exceeding 90dB. Noise level inside the denture fabrication room was between 65 to 83 dB., CONCLUSIONS: The noise level in the dental laboratory is considered to be a potential risk causing hearing loss. Regular audiometry checking up should be carried out among the dental technicians and ear protectors must be used during work.

AB  - Objectives: (1) Assess the noise attenuation of commercially available earplugs. (2) Determine if earplug characteristics affect attenuation of noise in everyday use. Method(s): Eleven pairs of commercially available ear plugs were obtained with different shapes, materials, and noisereduction ratings. Thirteen subjects underwent a sound field audiogram with and without each pair of ear plugs. Thresholds were recorded at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 kHz while wearing ear plugs. Attenuation values were calculated. Result(s): Thirteen subjects (46% female; mean age: 25 years) were included in the study. The average noise reduction rating for the 11 earplugs was 29 dB. There were 5 different earplug shapes: cylinder (n = 2), multiflanged (n = 2), rounded cone (n = 4), hemispherical (n = 1), and spherical (n = 2). Seven of the 11 earplugs were made of foam. The overall average attenuations (+/-standard deviation; range) at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 kHz were 8.0 dB (2.10; 4.6-12.3), 12.5 dB (2.39; 8.5- 16.9), 16.6 dB (2.42; 11.9-19.2), 28.4 dB (4.37; 21.9-36.9), 27.3 dB (5.54; 17.3-33.1), and 32.7 dB (5.40; 21.5-38.1), respectively. Multiflanged earplugs had the lowest average attenuation across all frequencies. Conclusion(s): The mean attenuation of earplugs is 21 dB. All material types provided similar attenuations. Multiflanged earplugs provided the least amount of noise protection across all frequencies. For some activities, such as shooting firearms, over-the-counter ear plugs are not sufficient for hearing protection. Additional hearing protection will be needed when participating in very loud activities.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate listening habits and hearing risks associated with the use of personal listening devices among urban high school students in Malaysia. Study design: Cross-sectional, descriptive study. Method(s): In total, 177 personal listening device users (13-16 years old) were interviewed to elicit their listening habits (e.g. listening duration, volume setting) and symptoms of hearing loss. Their listening levels were also determined by asking them to set their usual listening volume on an Apple iPod TM playing a pre-selected song. The iPod's sound output was measured with an artificial ear connected to a sound level meter. Subjects also underwent pure tone audiometry to ascertain their hearing thresholds at standard frequencies (0.5-8kHz) and extended high frequencies (9-16kHz). Result(s): The mean measured listening level and listening duration for all subjects were 72.2dBA and 1.2h/day, respectively. Their self-reported listening levels were highly correlated with the measured levels (. P<0.001). Subjects who listened at higher volumes also tend to listen for longer durations (. P=0.012). Male subjects listened at a significantly higher volume than female subjects (. P=0.008). When sound exposure levels were compared with the recommended occupational noise exposure limit, 4.5% of subjects were found to be listening at levels which require mandatory hearing protection in the occupational setting. Hearing loss (>=25dB hearing level at one or more standard test frequencies) was detected in 7.3% of subjects. Subjects' sound exposure levels from the devices were positively correlated with their hearing thresholds at two of the extended high frequencies (11.2 and 14kHz), which could indicate an early stage of noise-induced hearing loss. Conclusion(s): Although the average high school student listened at safe levels, a small percentage of listeners were exposed to harmful sound levels. Preventive measures are needed to avoid permanent hearing damage in high-risk listeners. © 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB  - Purpose of review: Up to 30 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially detrimental levels of noise. Although reliable medications for minimizing or reversing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are not currently available, NIHL is entirely preventable. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of occupational NIHL. We will focus on at-risk populations and discuss prevention programs. Current prevention programs focus on reducing inner ear damage by minimizing environmental noise production and through the use of personal hearing protective devices. Recent findings: NIHL is the result of a complex interaction between environmental factors and patient factors, both genetic and acquired. The effects of noise exposure are specific to an individual. Trials are currently underway evaluating the role of antioxidants in protection from, and even reversal of, NIHL. Summary: Occupational NIHL is the most prevalent occupational disease in the United States. Occupational noise exposures may contribute to temporary or permanent threshold shifts, although even temporary threshold shifts may predispose an individual to eventual permanent hearing loss. Noise prevention programs are paramount in reducing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposures.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: International standards based on the energy-equivalence principle predict a drastic deterioration of hearing protectors' noise attenuation if the protector is not worn for only brief time periods., OBJECTIVE: Therefore, studies in a laboratory setting were carried out to examine whether corresponding temporary threshold shifts (TTS) due to realistic noise exposures can be found., METHODS: Ten test subjects (Ss) were exposed to two reference exposures of 94 dB (A) for 1 h and 97 dB (A) for 1/2 h. Subsequently, they were exposed to noise of 106 dB (A) for 1/2 h on two additional days. With the exception of a 3 3/4 min-period, in these tests the Ss wore hearing protectors with noise attenuation of 20 dB and 30 dB, respectively. The resulting noise exposure was energetically identical to the reference exposures as well as to 85 dB (A)/8 h. If the equal-energy rule - which is used in the standards to predict the protection losses - is indeed valid, all 4 tests should result in almost identical threshold shifts., RESULTS: The experimental results do not confirm, but rather contradict the predicted drastic deterioration in attenuation. Particularly, the hearing protector with a noise attenuation of 30 dB performs much better in real-life situations than the theoretical assessment indicates., CONLUSIONS: With minimally reduced wearing time of hearing protectors the protection losses which are prognosticated by national and international standards are not associated. Instead, the energy equivalence principle applied in the standards leads to heavy misjudgments.

AB  - Our focus in this study was to assess hearing thresholds and the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus in a large group of rock musicians based in Norway. A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of TromsO. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians.

AB  - Objectives Environmental and occupational noise exposure have in some studies been related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypothetically by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between occupational noise exposure and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) as a measure of HPA activity. Methods This cross-sectional study included 398 industrial workers and as a reference 63 financial workers. Noise exposure levels were recorded every 5 seconds at the dominant shoulder by personal dosimeters for 24 hours and we calculated the LAeq value for work hours. For 310 workers who kept a diary on the use of hearing protection devices (HPD), we subtracted 10 dB from every noise recording obtained during HPD use and estimated the LAEq value at the ear. The next day salivary cortisol level was measured at awakening and after 10-60 min and the CAR was defined as the difference between the two. Results The mean measured noise exposure level was 79.7 dB(A) [range: 55.0-94.2] and the mean estimated level at the ear 77.6 dB(A) [range: 55.0-94.2]. In a linear regression model that adjusted for sex, age, calendar month, income, body mass index, sampling time and duration since occupational noise exposure, we observed no statistically significant exposure response relation between noise exposure level and CAR. This was neither the case in analyses of the effect of noise level estimated at the ear nor in internal analyses restricted to the industrial workers. Conclusions Neither measured nor estimated occupational noise exposure level was associated with the cortisol awakening response the following day. Thus, we found no indication that the glucocorticoid part of the HPA axis, measured through CAR, is involved in the causal pathway between occupational and environmental noise exposure and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Environmental and occupational noise exposure have been related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypothetically mediated by stress-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between recent and long-term occupational noise exposure and cortisol level measured off work to assess a possible sustained HPA-axis effect. We included 501 industrial, finance, and service workers who were followed for 24h during work, leisure, and sleep. Ambient occupational noise exposure levels were recorded every 5s by personal dosimeters and we calculated the full-shift LAEq value and estimated duration and cumulative exposure based on their work histories since 1980. For 332 workers who kept a log-book on the use of hearing protection devices (HPD), we subtracted 10dB from every noise recording obtained during HPD use and estimated the noise level at the ear. Salivary cortisol concentration was measured at 20.00h, the following day at awakening, and 30min after awakening on average 5, 14 and 14.5h after finishing work. The mean ambient noise exposure level was 79.9dB(A) [range: 55.0-98.9] and the mean estimated level at the ear 77.7dB(A) [range: 55.0-94.2]. In linear and mixed regression models that adjusted for age, sex, current smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, personal income, BMI, leisure-time noise exposure level, time since occupational noise exposure ceased, awakening time, and time of saliva sampling, we observed no statistically significant exposure response relation between recent, or long-term ambient occupational noise exposure level and any cortisol parameter off work. This was neither the case for recent noise level at the ear. To conclude, neither recent nor long-term occupational noise exposure levels were associated with increased cortisol level off work. Thus, our results do not indicate that a sustained activation of the HPA axis, as measured by cortisol, is involved in the causal pathway between occupational noise exposure and cardiovascular disease. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study surveyed youth recreational firearm users (YRFUs) regarding shooting habits, reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs), self-assessed auditory status, and attitudes about firearm noise and hearing loss. Design(s): A descriptive study using a 28-item survey administered by personal interview. Study sample: Two-hundred and ten youth aged 10 to 17 years responded. Result(s): Seventy-eight percent of those surveyed began shooting before the age of ten. The majority reported using large caliber firearms capable of rapid fire for both hunting and target practice. Most youths in this study were not aware of, and therefore, were not utilizing HPDs specifically designed for the shooting sports. Ten percent of subjects reported constant tinnitus and 45% notice tinnitus occurred or worsened after shooting. Although the majority of YRFUs reported good or perfect hearing, a small percentage (4-5%) of youth reported having only E&frac12;fair" hearing. Conclusion(s): YRFUs are putting themselves at risk beginning at a young age for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus based on self-reported shooting habits and inconsistent use of HPDs during both target practice and hunting activities. This research highlights the need for early education and intervention efforts to minimize the risk of NIHL in youth. © 2014 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to determine whether walking on a rotating disc would cause changes in perception of active and passive turning. Ten healthy control subjects wore a blindfold and earplugs while completing trials of active and passive turning. For active conditions, subjects were told the direction and amplitude of the desired turn and then attempted to turn in place the specified amount via actively stepping. For passive conditions, subjects were told that the disc they stood on would turn and they were to press a button when they had traveled the specified amplitude. Subjects completed active and passive trials to the left and right with amplitudes of 90, 180, 270, and 360degree. Subjects then stepped in place for 15 min on a disc rotating clockwise at 90degree/s, after which they repeated the trials of active and passive turning. Following rotating treadmill stimulation, subjects asked to turn in the direction opposite disc rotation (i.e., to the left) consistently and significantly overshot their targets in active trials. There were no changes in accuracy of active turning to the right or passive turning in either direction. This indicates that adaptation to the rotating treadmill is expressed even when subjects have a conscious intent to turn. The positive after-effects of the rotating treadmill add to the intended active turning in the direction of the after-effect but there is no decrement in active turning in the direction opposite the after-effect. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - In phase 1 of a large multiyear effort, health communication and health promotion models were used to develop a comprehensive hearing loss prevention training program for carpenters. Additionally, a survey was designed to be used as an evaluation instrument. The models informed an iterative research process in which the authors used key informant interviews, focus groups, and early versions of the survey tool to identify critical issues expected to be relevant to the success of the hearing loss prevention training. Commonly held attitudes and beliefs associated with occupational noise exposure and hearing losses, as well as issues associated with the use or non-use of hearing protectors, were identified. The training program was then specifically constructed to positively shape attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions associated with healthy hearing behaviors - especially those associated with appropriate hearing protector use. The goal was to directly address the key issues and overcome the barriers identified during the formative research phase. The survey was finalized using factor analysis methods and repeated pilot testing. It was designed to be used with the training as an evaluation tool and thus could indicate changes over time in attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions regarding hearing loss prevention. Finally, the training program was fine tuned with industry participation so that its delivery would integrate seamlessly into the existing health and safety training provided to apprentice carpenters. In phase 2, reported elsewhere in this volume, the training program and the survey were tested through a demonstration project at two sites.

AB  - The type test of hearing protectors (HPD) for certification purposes will be conducted in laboratory at room temperature. Optionally, the mechanical durability of HPDs will be tested in cold environment by a drop test. The purpose of this study was to find out the relevance of the drop test, the change of performance in HPD protection, and finally to estimate the possible change of protection efficiency against noise in cold environment. In total, 22 HPDs were selected to the measurements: 18 earmuffs, and 4 earmuffs attached to an industrial helmet. Attenuation of each earmuff cup was measured by applying insertion loss method for the test subjects in cold. The change of attenuation and temperature of cushion ring was followed up to nine minutes using 30-second intervals for sampling. Three HPDs were damaged in the test. The replaceable cushion was broken in two earmuffs and in one helmet-mounted HPD. The replaceable parts were replaced, and the HPD with attachment failure was removed from insertion loss measurement. In nine HPDs the relative change was less than 3 dB, and was at worst 10 dB. This change was typically at low frequencies, 125 Hz at the beginning when cooled HPDs were placed. In various HPDs the time to get the attenuation levelled varied from 1.5 minutes to 8 minutes. The recovery was dependent on the temperature of the cushion ring. In all cases the temperature of the full attenuation was achieved when the cushion ring reached 7degreeC. This temporary decrease in attenuation will have a minor effect to the protection efficiency, when the HPD is used full time during the whole exposure duration. A typical group of forest workers will have their exposure interrupted. The chain saws have to refuel, and the chain needs to be sharpened about every 40 minutes. During 6 hour daily operational time there will be about 9 - 10 minute break, long enough to cool the cushion ring back to below zero at -10degreeC, if the helmet mounted earmuffs are placed in stand-by position. In the worst case this will cause 1.6 dB increase in daily exposure level to noise.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Most workers in auto part factories in Thailand are usually exposed to excessive noise in their workplace. This study aimed to assess the level of occupational noise-induced hearing loss and investigate risk factors causing hearing loss in auto part factory workers in the welding units in Thailand., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. One hundred eighty subjects were recruited from 356 workers in the welding unit of three factories. Sixty eligible subjects in each factory were selected by systemic random sampling. The subjects were interviewed using a face-to-face questionnaire. Noise exposure levels and audiograms were measured by a noise dosimeter and an audiometer, respectively., RESULTS: The findings confirmed that noise exposure levels of 86-90 dB (A) and exceeding 90 dB (A) significantly increased the risk of hearing loss in either ear. A noise exposure level exceeding 90 dB (A) significantly increased the prevalence of hearing loss in both ears. Regarding, a 10-pack-year smoking history increased the prevalence of hearing loss in either ear or both ears. In addition, subjects with employment duration exceeding 10 years significantly developed hearing loss in either ear., CONCLUSIONS: The engineering control or personal control by wearing hearing protection device should be used to decrease noise exposure levels lower than 85 dB (A) for 8 h. Moreover, if the exposure level reaches 85 dB (A) for 8 h, the employer needs to implement a hearing conservation program in the workplace.

AB  - External auditory canal exostoses may be a preventable disease, so it is surprising that the regular use of water precautions is not greater among surfers. One reason for this is the impairment of hearing whilst wearing earplugs. The objective of this study is to establish the hearing impairment of commonly available earplugs used by surfers. Staff and patients with normal hearing were recruited to have pure tone audiometry performed multiple times, initially with no earplugs, and subsequently with earplugs. Three earplug types were tested which differed in their nature and material (prefabricated elastomer, custom-fitted silicone, and custom-fitted acrylic). Vented and non-vented forms of the earplugs were tested. 30 normal hearing ears were included. Two-tailed paired t-tests comparing hearing thresholds between different earplugs identified that the elastomer earplugs caused the least hearing impairment (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between vented and non-vented elastomer earplugs (p = 0.148), but the difference between vented and non-vented forms of other earplugs was statistically significant (silicone p = 0.010, acrylic p = 0.018). Prefabricated ear plugs produce less hearing impairment than other commonly available earplugs. A customised earplug made of hard material causes the greatest impairment of hearing. We therefore recommend that for aquatic sports where hearing is important, a soft prefabricated earplug is preferable. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Common equipment in the dental operatory generate cumulative noise at sufficient decibel levels that can damage hearing. Although noise exposure in the dental office is typically intermittent, dentists and other dental care providers have been shown to be at risk of hearing loss. This article provides dentist-generated insight to use when incorporating hearing protection devices during dental practice. Four hearing protection devices (HPDs) were provided to 15 dentists in randomized sequence for evaluation. Perceptions were gathered via questionnaires and analyzed to determine mean ratings and product preferences. Battery requirements of electronic HPDs were also examined. Qualitative assessments of the HPDs evaluated are presented, including dentist preferences and recommendations. There were statistically significant differences ( P <= 0.0031) among the HPDs in terms of ease of insertion, aesthetics, ability to hear while using a handpiece, and the openness of the ear. Battery life was not found to differ between the 2 electronic HPDs evaluated. Dentists most highly valued ease of hearing, ability to communicate, and comfort while wearing HPDs. The DI-15 High-Fidelity Electronic Earplugs HPD was ranked the highest, followed by Music PRO Electronic Earplugs. Battery longevity for these electronic HPDs was similar under all tested conditions studied. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Dentists should understand the potential ramifications of hearing loss and be aware that there are commercially available hearing protection products that preserve the ability to communicate with patients and coworkers.

AB  - Patients' perceptions of noise events that prevent/interrupt nighttime sleep after cardiac surgery and sleep promotion aids were studied for associations with patient characteristics. Overhead paging, equipment, and loud communication prevented/interrupted nighttime sleep; however, most patient characteristics were not associated with the presence or absence of these noise events. Patients selected pain medication to promote sleep. Other sleep aids were used infrequently. Behavioral and structural noise reduction interventions are needed to minimize sleep interruptions.

AB  - Aims and Objectives : 1. To quantify and typify hearing thresholds of plastic weavers exposed to occupational noise by pure tone audiometry. 2. To study effects of sex, duration of exposure, shift work and smoking on hearing and their role as a preventive one. 3. To sensitize workers about use of protective measures and to suggest better type of work shift. Method(s): Present cross sectional field study was carried out in 50 plastic weavers working in various shifts with minimum 5 years of exposure, no break in job after ruling out other causes of hearing loss apart from NIHL. The results of hearing thresholds at various frequencies for pure tones taken in dB were compared with age and sex matched controls and various factors were compared for statistical significance. Result(s): Hearing thresholds were worse at higher than speech frequencies which further worsened with increase in duration of exposure. Interrupted shift than continuous shift, non smoking, and female gender showed advantage. Audiometric notch at 6 kHz was more prevalent than at 4 kHz. Conclusion(s): Unaffected hearing at speech frequencies keeps disease unrecognized in early stage of NIHL. Affection of 6 kHz in majority than classical 4 kHz and mild to moderate degree of hearing loss is attributable to continuous type of noise that is less damaging which can be further reduced by interrupted shift with weekends off, use of hearing protective devices and by nonsmoking.

AB  - Background: Exposure to Occupational noise is the major avoidable cause of permanent hearing loss that is preventable by protective measures. Present study evaluated hearing profile and effects of shift, sex, and smoking on hearing loss in plastic weavers working in textile industry exposed to impact type of noise. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study of hearing threshold of various shift workers of plastic weaving industries (18 males, 32 females) at various frequencies was done and effect of various factors was tested at low and high frequencies and compared at 4 kHz, 6 kHz, and 8 kHz statistically. Result(s): Hearing thresholds were significantly higher at high frequencies than speech frequencies, in day shift workers than night shift workers and within day shift workers more with continuous type of shift work than interrupted type. Females showed better hearing than males and for non-smokers than smokers, but the difference observed in both instances proved statistically insignificant. Conclusion(s): It can be concluded that the use of alternate day and night shift, interrupted day shift may be used to prevent hearing loss and for further confirmation few more studies are warranted. Being female and non smoking also proved an advantage. Comparatively, mild to moderate degree of hearing loss further reinforces the scope of prevention by hearing protective devices and interrupted shift design of work.

AB  - The study assessed awareness and attitudes of people working in the environment (users) of the motor parks (but not travelers), in a sub-urban town to environmental noise and its hazards. Regular users of major motor parks in Sagamu were administered with pretested structured questionnaire to obtain information on their awareness and attitudes concerning noise and NIHL at the parks. Descriptive and comparative analysis of the data obtained was performed by using SPSS version 15.0. Data from 387 subjects were analysed; 61.2% were males, mean age was 35.5 11.4 years, 56.8% had secondary school education, and 50.6% were vehicle drivers or conductors. 51.2% ascribed vehicular traffic the major source of noise generation at the parks, while average noise level was 84.1 +/- 6.0 dBA. Among the subjects, 61.2% approved motor park was noisy, 47.8% (185/387) were aware of NIHL. Awareness did not change with age and sex, but increased significantly with level of education. 51.9% were concerned about the noisy environment, 12.7% (49/387) protected themselves from the effect of the noise, 6.1% used ear plugs. Attitudes of the users did not change with age, sex, and level of education. Noise level at the motor parks were marginally high, awareness of the users to noise and its hazards was relatively high but attitudes concerning protection from noise hazards was poor. Health education for the users and noise regulation at the parks were recommended.

AB  - This study assessed attitudes toward the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) and the effect of an educational intervention on fit-testing results by comparing personal attenuation ratings (PAR50) before and after the intervention. Employees (n = 327) from a large metal container manufacturer at four geographic locations were tested with a field attenuation estimation system (FAES) to identify workers (n = 91) requiring intervention. PAR50 values significantly increased from baseline to post-intervention (p < .001, 15.1 to 26.9) and at the 6-month follow-up (p < .001, 95% confidence interval = -11.2, -6.3). Perceived self-efficacy scores for using HPDs significantly declined from baseline to post-intervention (p = .006, 95% confidence interval = 0.3, 1.9), but were not significantly related to PAR50. Therefore, a FAES can assist the occupational health nurse to identify workers at high risk (low PAR50), teach proper fit and use of HPDs, and improve hearing protector selection.Copyright 2014, SLACK Incorporated.

AB  - The importance of adequate sleep for good health and immune system function is well documented as is reduced sleep quality experienced by ICU patients. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Elliot and co-workers present a well done, largest of its kind, single-center study on sleep patterns in critically ill patients. They base their study on the 'gold standard', the polysomnography technique, which is resource demanding to perform and often difficult to evaluate. The results are especially interesting as the authors not only used polysomnography in a large sample but also, in contrast to others, excluded patients with prior sleep problems. They also recorded patients' subjective sleep experiences in the ICU and thereafter in the ward (validated questionnaires) with simultaneous data collection of factors known to affect sleep in the ICU (mainly treatment interventions, light and sound disturbances). Interestingly, but not surprisingly, sleep was both quantitatively and qualitatively poor. Furthermore, there seemed to be little or no improvement over time when compared to earlier studies. This study stresses the magnitude of the sleep problem despite interventions such as earplugs and/or eyeshades. Sound disturbance was found to be the most significant but improvable factor. The study highlights the challenge and the importance of evaluating sleep in the critical care setting and the present need for alternative methods to measure it. All that in conjunction can be used to solve an important problem for this patient group. © 2013 BioMed Central Ltd.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been recognized as a problem among workers in Indian industries. The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries.

AB  - Occupational noise has been recognized as hazardous for the human beings. A high noise level in forging shops is considered to lower the labour productivity and cause illness however occupational noise is being accepted as an integral part of the job. The present study has been carried out in 5 small scale hand tool forging units (SSI) of different sizes in Northern India in Punjab. Noise levels at various sections were measured. OSHA norms for hearing conservation has been incorporated which includes an exchange rate of 5 dB (A), criterion level at 90 dB (A), criterion time of 8 h, threshold level=80 dB (A), upper limit=140 dB (A) and with F/S response rate. Equivalent sound pressure level (Leq) has been measured in various sections of these plants. Noise at various sections like hammer section, cutting presses, punching, grinding and barrelling process was found to be >90 dB (A), which is greater than OSHA norms. A cross-sectional study on the basis of questionnaire has been carried out. The results of which revealed that 68% of the workers are not wearing ear protective equipments out of these 50% were not provided with PPE by the company. About 95% of the workers were suffering speech interference though high noise annoyance was reported by only 20%. It has been established that the maximum noise exposure is being taken by the workers as they are working more than 8 h a day for six days per week. More than 90% workers are working 12 to 24 h over time per week which lead to very high noise exposure i.e. 50 to 80% per week higher than exposure time/week in USA or European countries 15,16).

AB  - The present study focused on exploring the current level of hearing protection and subsequently determined the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss among casting and forging industry workers. The casting and forging industry provides employment to a significant portion of the population. The level of hearing protection was assessed through questionnaire survey of 572 workers. Out of these workers, 165 and another control group of 57 participants were assessed by formal audiometry. Audiometric tests were conducted at frequencies of 1.0 KHz to 8.0 KHz.The occurrence of hearing loss was determined on the basis of a hearing threshold level with a low fence of 25 dB. Student's test and ANOVA were used to compare the various groups; a p value < .05 was considered statistically significant. More than 90% of the workers sampled showed significant hearing loss at medium and high frequencies. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared with the workers associated with the other activities. The workers of the Indian steel industry are highly exposed to occupational noise. The majority of workers are not protected from noise-induced hearing loss. There is a need to provide special ear protectors for workers engaged in forging. A complete hearing protection program, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, needs to be introduced.

AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review highlight the need for additional research into the effectiveness of hearing protection device use as a noise-induced hearing loss preventative measure in youth who live or work on farms and the creation of effective interventions to increase hearing protection device use and decrease Noise-induced hearing loss risk., AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify and compare hearing protection interventions for youth working and living on farms., BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss represents a significant risk factor for injury, disability and death in agricultural populations due to an inability to receive sensory information that can indicate dangerous situations. Despite the availability of hearing protection devices, rates of utilisation remain low, while rates of noise-induced hearing loss are high within the agricultural youth population., DESIGN: Comprehensive review of the literature., METHOD: Electronic database searches were conducted to identify research studies of hearing protection interventions for youth living or working on farms., RESULTS: Three intervention studies were identified as meeting the review criteria, with additional reanalysis studies based on the original intervention studies. The intervention studies demonstrated increased use of hearing protection devices among youth who received the interventions compared to the control groups although audiometry testing results were not improved as a result of the intervention., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is recommended that nurses be educated in the areas of health promotion relevant to farming communities to be able to effectively meet their rural clients' needs in relation to noise-induced hearing loss. Working with youth, families, and schools, as well as developing community partnerships, can facilitate the dissemination of hearing protection promotion.Copyright © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This report follows up and extends an exploratory investigation of a hypothetical adaptive chronic gain (amplification of suprathreshold information) process within the auditory system. In theory, this hypothetical gain process is plastic and can be systematically modified and recalibrated. The idea of an adaptive auditory gain mechanism is a fundamental concept in the treatment of both tinnitus and hyperacusis with tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). This notion, however, has gone virtually untested. The hypothesis of this research is that judgments of loudness provide a functional index of chronic auditory gain. Further, chronic auditory gain can be manipulated either upward or downward in a controlled way by prolonged reduction or enhancement in the levels of background sound to which a listener is exposed. To evaluate these assertions, 8 normal-hearing volunteers were assigned randomly to continuous (23 hours/day), chronic (4-week) external sound treatments. Participants were exposed either to low-level sound produced by bilateral in-the-ear noise generators (NGs) or were fitted bilaterally with sound-attenuating earplugs (EPs) in a sequential crossover design. Both treatments produced elevated audibility thresholds, mainly above 1000 Hz. The effects of each treatment type on loudness judgments were evaluated to test the following predictions: (1) The EPs would enhance the magnitude of perceived loudness and the resulting loudness growth functions would become steeper as a consequence of chronic sound attenuation (consistent with enhanced system gain in response to diminished peripheral sound input); whereas, (2) the NGs would reduce the magnitude of perceived loudness and the resulting loudness growth functions would become shallower (consistent with diminished system gain in response to the elevated background input). Results after 4 weeks of each treatment were consistent with the above predictions, providing support for a plastic, chronic auditory gain process, and the use of sound therapy (i.e., NGs) in TRT.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was (a) to investigate the behaviors, knowledge, and motivators associated with personal listening device (PLD) use and (b) to determine the influence of different types of hearing health risk education information (text with or without visual images) on motivation to modify PLD listening use behaviors in young adults., Method: College-age students (N = 523) completed a paper-and-pencil survey tapping their behaviors, knowledge, and motivation regarding listening to music or media at high volume using PLDs. Participants rated their motivation to listen to PLDs at lower volume levels following each of three information sets: text only, behind-the-ear hearing aid image with text, and inner ear hair cell damage image with text., Results: Acoustically pleasing and emotional motives were the most frequently cited (38%-45%) reasons for listening to music or media using a PLD at high volume levels. The behind-the-ear hearing aid image with text information was significantly (p < .0001) more motivating to participants than text alone or the inner ear hair cell damage image with text., Conclusions: Evocative imagery using hearing aids may be an effective approach in hearing protective health campaigns for motivating safer listening practices with PLDs in young adults.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Data indicate that 1 in 6 adolescents has high-frequency hearing loss, which is typically noise related and preventable. Parental participation improves the success of adolescent behavioral interventions, yet little is known about parental perspectives regarding adolescent noise-induced hearing loss. OBJECTIVE To perform a survey to determine parental knowledge of adolescent hearing loss and willingness to promote hearing conservation to discern information that is critical to design adolescent hearing loss prevention programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of a nationally representative online sample of parents of 13- to 17-year-olds. INTERVENTIONS A survey conducted with the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health, a recurring online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Parental knowledge of adolescent hearing loss and willingness to promote hearing conservation. RESULTS Of 716 eligible respondents, 96.3%of parents reported that their adolescent was slightly or not at all at risk of hearing problems from excessive noise, and 69.0%had not spoken with their adolescent about noise exposure, mainly because of the perceived low risk. Nonetheless, to protect their adolescents' hearing, more than 65.0%of parents are either willing or very willing to consider limiting time listening to music, limiting access to excessively noisy situations, or insisting on the use of hearing protection (earplugs or earmuffs). Higher parental education increased the odds of promoting hearing-protective strategies. Parents were less likely to insist on hearing protection for older adolescents. Parents who understood that both volume and time of exposure affect hearing damage were more likely to have discussed hearing loss with their adolescent (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 1.29-3.03). The odds of discussing hearing loss were also increased for those who were willing or very willing to limit time listening to music (OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.19-2.26) and to insist on hearing protection (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.15-3.18) compared with parents who were very unwilling, unwilling, or neutral. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite the rising prevalence of acquired adolescent hearing loss, few parents believe their adolescent is at risk. Those with higher education are more willing to promote hearing conservation, especially with younger adolescents. To create effective hearing conservation programs, parents need better education on this subject as well as effective and acceptable strategies to prevent adolescent noise exposure.

AB  - Hearing protection devices (HPD) remain a primary method of prevention of noise-induced hearing loss despite their well-known limitations. A three-pronged intervention to increase HPD use was conducted among construction workers and included a baseline hearing loss prevention training, follow-up 'toolbox' (TB) reinforcement trainings, and use of a personal noise level indicator (NLI). A total of 176 subjects on eight sites completed three assessments. Prior to intervention, HPDs were used an average of 34.5% of the time and increased significantly, up about 12.1% after intervention and 7.5% two months after interventions were completed. The increase in HPD use was greatest among the group receiving both TB and NLI interventions; up about 25% from baseline, and this group was about two times more likely to use HPDs than the BL (baseline) training only group. This study demonstrates the mild impact of a well-constructed HPD use training and provides support for the additional use of a personal NLI to increase use of HPDs among construction workers. The most effective procedures for using such instruments require further exploration. © 2011 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to determine the effects of earplug use on the subjective experience of sleep for patients in critical care. BACKGROUND: The negative effects of noise in critical care include sleep disturbances, increased stress response, and reduced patient satisfaction. The nature of critical care often precludes quiet time protocols. Previous studies indicated that earplugs can improve REM sleep and sleep efficiency. This study examined the effects of earplugs as a non-invasive method for improving the subjective sleep experience and increasing patient satisfaction. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental intervention study with random assignment of subjects. METHOD(S): Subjects were non-ventilated, non-sedated adults admitted to critical care. The intervention group used earplugs during nighttime sleep hours allowing short term removal during patient care. Participants completed the Verran-Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale, an 8-question visual analogue scale, to describe their subjective response to sleep. Two sample T-tests were used to detect differences between the group scores. RESULT(S): 88 participants (49 intervention/39 control) completed the study. Mean age 63, 56% males, 93% Caucasian. Total sleep satisfaction scores were significantly better for the intervention group (p = .002). Seven of the subjective categories were independently significant (p = .005-.044). One category, satisfaction with the amount of time needed to fall asleep, was not significant (p = .111). CONCLUSION(S): Earplug use improved the subjective experience of sleep for un-medicated critical care patients without interfering with care delivery. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The negligible cost and low level of invasiveness of earplugs makes this preferable as a primary intervention to promote sleep while avoiding unnecessary sedating medications.

AB  - Objectives Environmental and occupational noise exposure have been related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Activation of the physiological stress response and altered serum lipid levels have been proposed as alternative causal pathways. The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between occupational noise exposure and serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides when taking account of the use of hearing protection devices (HPD) and well-established predictors of lipid levels. Methods This cross-sectional study included 460 Danish industrial workers and 69 financial workers included as a reference. They provided a serum sample and lipid levels were determined. All participants wore portable dosimeters that recorded noise exposure levels at the dominant shoulder every 5 seconds for a 24 hour period. We extracted measurements obtained during work and calculated the LAeq value. For 341 workers who kept a HPD diary we subtracted 10 dB from every noise recording obtained during HPD use and estimated the noise exposure level at the ear. Results The mean measured noise exposure level was 80.0 dB(A) [range: 55.0-98.9] and the mean estimated level at the ear 77.8 dB(A) [range:55.0-94.2]. The measured level was strongly associated with increasing levels of triglycerides (p = 0,01), cholesterol-HDL ratio (p < 0,01) and decreasing levels of HDL-cholesterol (p = 0,01), but only in unadjusted analyses that did not account for HPD use. In analyses of estimated noise exposure level at the ear that were adjusted for body mass index and smoking status among others no effects were seen. Conclusion No association between current occupational noise exposure level and serum lipid levels was observed. This does not indicate that a causal pathway between occupational and environmental noise exposure and cardiovascular disease, if such a relation exists, includes alteration of lipid levels.

AB  - The phantom auditory sensation of tinnitus is now studied in humans, animals, and computer models, and our understanding of how tinnitus is triggered and which neural mechanisms give rise to the phantom sensation in the brain has increased considerably. In most cases, tinnitus is associated with hearing loss, and even tinnitus patients with normal hearing thresholds might have cochlear damage that is not detected through conventional audiometry, as has been recently shown through auditory brainstem response measurements. Animals show behavioural signs of tinnitus after induction of hearing loss, indicating a causal relation. Moreover, surgical reduction of hearing loss in otosclerosis can reduce or even abolish tinnitus. However, hearing loss does not always lead to tinnitus. Psychophysical measurements have indicated that certain types of cochlear damage might be more closely linked to tinnitus than others. Recent animal studies have used behavioural testing to distinguish between animals with and without tinnitus after noise exposure. Comparisons between these groups of animals have helped identify neural correlates of tinnitus as well as factors that could represent a predisposition for tinnitus. Human neuroimaging studies have also begun to separate the neural signature of tinnitus from other consequences of hearing loss. The functional mechanisms that could underlie tinnitus development tinnitus have been analysed in computational modelling studies, which indicate that tinnitus could be a side-effect of the brain's attempt to compensate for hearing loss. Even though causal treatments for tinnitus are currently not available, hearing aids can provide considerable benefit when used in conjunction with counselling, tinnitus retraining therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy. Finally, animal studies demonstrate that the development of chronic noise-induced tinnitus might be prevented through timely interventions after noise exposure.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: In a cohort study of lumber mill workers' exposure to noise and incidence of heart disease, initial noise estimates were likely overestimated because they did not account for reductions afforded by the use of hearing protection. As such information was seldom available for individual workers, modeling was necessary to predict hearing protection use and derive adjusted noise measures. Objective(s): To develop a multilevel model of the likelihood of use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) for British Columbia (Canada) lumber mill workers. Method(s): The study population included 13147 workers in 14 sawmills for whom we had information on HPD use. Subjects self-reported their use of hearing protectors during routine hearing tests over their work history period. Separate multilevel logistic regression models with increasing complexity were developed for a subcohort of workers with complete information (n = 1493) and for a subcohort comprised subjects with hearing tests coinciding with their jobs (n = 10 203). The models included random intercepts for worker and for sawmill. Result(s): HPD use was associated in both subcohorts with factors such as noise exposure and age. We also showed that specific jobs (such as sawfiling) and departments (planer, in particular) were strongly associated with the use of HPDs. The model illustrates the quantitative importance of including a hierarchical structure which allows for explaining potential sources of outcome variability. Conclusion(s): We developed a hierarchical model to predict hearing protection use to enable correction of exposure assessments for use in retrospective epidemiological studies. We showed that this was feasible even in the absence of complete determinant information.

AB  - Objective: To account for use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) in retrospective noise exposure assessment, adjust noise exposure estimates accordingly, and validate the adjusted estimates. Background(s): A previous study in the same working population showed a stronger relation for noise and acute myocardial infarction among those who did not wear HPD. Because accurate noise exposure assessment is complicated by the use of HPD, we previously developed a multilevel model of the likelihood of HPD use for British Columbia (Canada) lumber mill workers. Historical estimates of noise exposure can be adjusted according to models predictions and a reduction in misclassifying workers, exposure is expected. Method(s): Work history and exposure information were obtained for 13147 lumber mill workers followed from 1909 until 1998. Audiometric data for the cohort, including hearing threshold levels at several pure tone frequencies, were obtained from the local regulatory agency for the period from 1978 to 2003. Following the modeling of HPD use, noise estimates were adjusted according to models predictions and attenuation factors based on existing research and standards. Adjusted and unadjusted noise metrics were compared by investigating their ability to predict noise-induced hearing loss. Result(s): We showed a 4-fold increase in the noise exposure and hearing loss slope, after adjusting for HPD use, while controlling for gender, age, race, as well as medical and non-occupational confounding variables. Conclusion(s): While the relative difference before and after adjustment for use of HPD is considerable, we observed a subtle absolute magnitude of the effect. Using noise-induced hearing loss as a 'gold standard' for testing the assessment of retrospective noise exposure estimates should continue to be investigated.

AB  - Background: Development of noise-induced hearing loss is reliant on a few factors such as frequency, intensity, and duration of noise exposure. The occurrence of this occupational malady has doubled from 120 million to 250 million in a decade. Countries such as Malaysia, India, and the US have adopted 90 dBA as the permissible exposure limit. According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the exposure limit for noise is 90 dBA, while that of the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 85 dBA for 8 hours of noise exposure. Objective(s): This study aimed to assess the development of hearing threshold levels beyond 25 dBA on adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit compared to 90 dBA. Patients and Methods: This is an intervention study done on two automobile factories. There were 203 employees exposed to noise levels beyond the action level. Hearing protection devices were distributed to reduce noise levels to a level between the permissible exposure limit and action level. The permissible exposure limits were 90 and 85 dBA in factories 1 and 2, respectively, while the action levels were 85 and 80 dBA, respectively. The hearing threshold levels of participants were measured at baseline and at first month of postshift exposure of noise. The outcome was measured by a manual audiometer. McNemar and chi-square tests were used in the statistical analysis. Result(s): We found that hearing threshold levels of more than 25 dBA has changed significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention among participants from both factories (3000 Hz for the right ear and 2000 Hz for the left ear). There was a statistically significant association between participants at 3000 Hz on the right ear at 'deteriorated' level (chi2 (1) = 4.08, phi = - 0.142, P = 0.043), whereas there was worsening of hearing threshold beyond 25 dBA among those embraced 90 dBA. Conclusion(s): The adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit has preserved hearing threshold level among participants at 3000 Hz compared to those who embraced 90 dBA.Copyright © 2014, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal; Published by Kowsar.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a questionnaire assessing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) as they pertain to hearing conservation, using the constructs of the health belief model (HBM)., DESIGN: The KAB was completed by 235 participants. Relationships between knowledge and attitudes about hearing and hearing conservation, participation in noisy activities, and use of hearing protection were examined., STUDY SAMPLE: 117 males and 118 females aged between 18 and 80 years (mean = 42.3, SD = 4.1) recruited from the Portland VA Medical Center, local universities, and a community college., RESULTS: Knowledge scores ranged from 15.6% to 93.8%. Factor analyses revealed six attitude factors, interpreted as measuring perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, and cues to action. Over 95% of participants routinely participated in at least one noisy activity but few used hearing protection while doing so. The attitude scores of individuals who used hearing protection differed significantly from the scores of those who did not., CONCLUSIONS: Significant relationships between use of hearing protection and scores on the KAB provide validation that the HBM is a valuable framework for understanding hearing health behaviors, and evidence that the KAB is a valid tool for assessing these attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - Gun-shooting deafness is the common terminology applied to sensorineural hearing loss caused by shooting firearms. Many characteristics of gun-shooting hearing loss have been proposed, but they have not been defined clearly or established conclusively. We studied 37 users of recreational firearms to obtain pilot data to help determine if it is true that right-handed gun shooters develop more hearing loss in the left ear and vice versa, whether everyone who frequently shoots guns develops sensorineural hearing loss, and whether significant hearing loss is typically prevented by wearing commercially available ear protectors while shooting.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Noise-induced hearing loss is a major preventable occupational hazard. The ill effect of noise exposure is well evidenced by researchers. This study was done to study the self-assessment of hearing quality, annoyance evaluation, noise-related attitude and knowledge in traffic police, and bus drivers on Indian population in a growing city. Subjects and Methods: The study was done on 60 nonsmokers, male traffic police, and 80 long route bus drivers in the age range of 30-50 years. There were 15 questions related to self-assessment administered on these individuals. Result(s): The results revealed that in spite of regular noise exposure, around 60% individuals rated excellent hearing. Further, surprisingly all individuals rated no knowledge of any ear protection devices available. Nearly, 30-50% individuals related to poor quality of sleep due to noise exposure in both groups. The result also revealed strong association between the responses of most of the questions asked from bus drivers and traffic police. Conclusion(s): The negative consequences of noise exposure are well reflected as an outcome of this questionnaire-based study which shows these individuals are having signs of hearing-related problems. Hence, there is a need to educate these professionals about hazardous effect of noise exposure.Copyright © 2016 Indian Journal of Otology.

AB  - This descriptive cross-sectional study examines the compliance of workers from the European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium (EURODIF) with personal protection equipment (PPE) in view of the various hazards in the nuclear fuel industry. The PPE inventory was drawn up by an industrial hygienist in charge of the PPE at EURODIF. Two hundred and twenty seven (10 %) randomly selected, active and retired, EURODIF workers filled in a questionnaire on their attitudes towards PPE. Exposure data from the EURODIF job exposure matrix were used to examine whether PPE usage varies according to exposure level. The study suggests a PPE usage profile that varies depending on the hazards present and PPE available. Anti-uranium PPE and gloves were among the best rated, while anti-spray goggles were the least used. We found that, for most hazards known to cause cancer or irreversible health damage, PPE usage varied according to exposure (homogeneity test, p<0.05; trend test, p<0.05). The continuous use of PPE among workers should be encouraged through improvements to the PPE management system. A precise model of individual exposure can only be designed if the use and efficiency of PPE are taken into consideration.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of hearing protector insertion by comparing attenuation values measured by objective (MIRE) and subjective (REAT) methods in groups with and without training., METHODS: The study included 80 male subjects assigned to experimental (with training) and control (without training) groups. The following procedures were performed: occupational history, objective and subjective assessment of hearing protectors. Only subjects in the experimental group received training and guidance on proper hearing protector insertion., RESULTS: Attenuation values were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group at all frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) investigated through the objective (MIRE) and subjective (REAT) methods. In addition, attenuation values in the control group were lower than those provided by the hearing protector manufacturer., CONCLUSION: Both objective and subjective attenuation tests demonstrated the efficacy of training on insertion of hearing protectors because the group that received training on proper hearing protection insertion exhibited higher attenuation values than the untrained group.

AB  - MATERIALS & METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analytic study that was performed on 184 patients with tinnitus referred to ENT clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia. After examination, audiometry performed and questionnaires of tinnitus patients were completed. The results were analyzed by statistical SPSS software., RESULTS: The study included 111 males and 73 females and the mean age was 50.6 years. 168 patients (91.3%) had non-pulsatile tinnitus and the rest had pulsatile tinnitus. The mean hearing loss in patients was 31.4 dB, 79.9% were of sensory neurons kind, and 12.5% of patients did not show any hearing loss in audiometry. In total, 90.2% of the cases were detected; most causes of tinnitus were noise (19.6%), ototoxicity (16.8%) and presbycusis (16.3%). The most common causes of tinnitus were noise with 31.5% in males and ototoxicity with 27.4% in females. Between age and hearing loss of patients, there was a significant relationship (0.001> P-value), but there was no significant relationship between gender and degree of hearing loss., DISCUSSION: The most common cause of tinnitus (NIHL) is quite predictable, except by accident, you can completely avoid by reducing noise levels on the source and ear protection. By reasonable prescription of ototoxic medications particularly antibiotics can reduce the prevalence of tinnitus that causes sleep disorders and concentration problems, depression and anxiety and help the public health., INTRODUCTION: Tinnitus includes all the sounds perceived by the patient, without any external stimulus that affects all aspects of life; there is no cure for most patients. Given that tinnitus and hearing of the ear are common complaints of patients in clinics and due to the impossibility of cure at the present time, it is necessary to set up common causes of tinnitus to solve social problems and present optimal solutions. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of tinnitus in patients referred to ENT Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Urmia, 2012-2013.

AB  - METHODS: Unmatched case control and comparative studies were carried out among fertilizer factory workers in Sarawak with the aim of determining contributing factors for hearing impairment. Respondents consisted of 49 cases that were diagnosed from 2005 to 2008 with 98 controls from the same work places. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test were used in a univariate analysis to determine the association between hearing impairment and the contributing risks being studied., RESULTS: The results of the univariate analysis showed that hearing impairment was significantly (p<0.05) associated with older age, lower education level, high smoking dose, high occupational daily noise dose, longer duration of service, infrequent used of hearing protection device (HPD), and low perception of sound on HPD usage. Multivariate logistic regression of hearing impairment after controlling for age found the following five variables: occupational daily noise dose >=50% (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.36-8.89), >=15 years of services (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.16-7.33), infrequent use of HPD (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.15-6.77), low perception of sound on HPD (POR 2.77, 95% CI 1.09-6.97), and smoking more than 20 packs per year (OR 4.71, 95% CI 1.13-19.68)., DISCUSSION: In conclusion, high occupational noise exposure level, longer duration of service, low perception of sound on HPD, infrequent used of HPD, and smoking more than 20 packs per year were the contributing factors to hearing impairment, and appropriate intervention measures should be proposed and taken into considerations., INTRODUCTION: Hearing impairment remains the main occupational health problem in the manufacturing industry, and its contributing factors have not been well controlled.

AB  - A study of 40 novice hearing protection users was conducted to determine if the use of a lubricant with hearing protective plugs would enhance their attenuation. Three types of hearing protection devices (i.e., earplugs) were evaluated: roll-down PVC foam, mushroom-style polyurethane foam, and elastomeric flanged. For each earplug type, the right and left ear (dry and lubricated, respectively) personal attenuation rating was determined using a commercially available microphone in real-ear apparatus. Earplug efficacy was observed to increase in the presence of a lubricant for all 3 plug types, with average mean elevations by earplug type ranging from 1.5-5.1 dB. Two of three earplug types saw statistically significant improvements when used with lubrication, demonstrating heightened mean personal attenuation ratings of 2.8 dB and 5.1 dB. The issues of handedness and gender differences (vis a vis ear canal size) are explored, and the importance of proper fitting is discussed in detail. Several specific questions yet to be answered are posed, and directions for further research indicated.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: The challenges associated with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) are due primarily to temporal impairment and therefore tend to affect perception of low- to midfrequency sounds. A common treatment option for severe impairment in ANSD is cochlear implantation, and because the degree of impairment is unrelated to degree of hearing loss by audiometric thresholds, this population may have significant acoustic sensitivity in the contralateral ear. Clinically, the question arises as to how we should treat the contralateral ear in this population when there is acoustic hearing - should we plug it, amplify it, implant it, or leave it alone? Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute amplification and plugging of the contralateral ear compared to no intervention in implanted children with ANSD and aidable contralateral hearing. It was hypothesized that due to impaired temporal processing in ANSD, contralateral acoustic input would interfere with speech perception achieved with the cochlear implant (CI) alone; therefore, speech perception performance will decline with amplification and improve with occlusion. Research Design: Prospective within-subject comparison. Adaptive speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) for monosyllable and spondee word stimuli were measured in quiet and in noise for the intervention configurations. Study Sample: Nine children treated at the Medical College of Wisconsin Koss Cochlear Implant Program participated in the study. Inclusion criteria for this study were children diagnosed with ANSD who were unilaterally implanted, had aidable hearing in the contralateral ear (defined as a three-frequency pure-tone average of <=80 dB HL), had at least 1 yr of cochlear implant experience, and were able to perform the speech perception task. Intervention(s): We compared SRT with the CI alone to SRTs with interventions of cochlear implant with a contralateral hearing aid (CI+HA) and cochlear implant with a contralateral earplug (CI+plug). Data Collection and Analysis: SRTs were measured and compared within subjects across listening conditions. Within-subject comparisons were analyzed using paired t-tests, and analyses of predictive variables for effects of contralateral intervention were analyzed using linear regression. Result(s): Contrary to the hypothesis, the bimodal CI+HA configuration showed a significant improvement in mean performance over the CI-alone configuration in quiet (p = .04). In noise, SRTs were obtained for six subjects, and no significant bimodal benefit was observed (p = .09). There were no consistent effects of occlusion observed across subjects and stimulus conditions. Degree of bimodal benefit showed a significant relationship with performance with the CI alone, with greater bimodal benefit associated with poorer CI-alone performance (p = .01). This finding, however, was limited by floor effects. Conclusion(s): The results of this study indicate that children with ANSD who are experienced cochlear implant users may benefit from contralateral amplification, particularly for moderate cochlear implant performers. It is unclear from these data whether long-term contralateral hearing aid use in real-world situations would ultimately benefit this population; however, a hearing aid trial is recommended with assessment of bimodal benefit over time. These data may help inform clinical guidelines for determining optimal hearing configurations for unilaterally implanted children with ANSD, particularly when considering candidacy for sequential cochlear implantation.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep is essential for emotional and physical well being. In the ICU, sleep quality and quantity are often inadequate due to noise, lights, patient care activities, and pain. ICU survivors report that sleep deprivation ranks as a major source of anxiety and stress. Sleep disturbances are associated with the development of delirium in ICU patients. Hypothesis: Implementation of a sleep promotion program in the ICU can increase patients reports of sleep satisfaction and decrease the prevalence of delirium. Method(s): Baseline data regarding sleep preferences and quality of sleep in the ICU were collected from interviews of ICU patients that were able to self report. A sleep assessment tool and care plan was developed and implemented. Staff education on the risks of sleep deprivation and use of the sleep preference assessment and care plan was completed via staff meetings, newsletters, and signage. Sleep promotion interventions such as <> eye masks, and ear plugs were implemented. Delirium prevalence was monitored weekly. A post-intervention patient survey regarding sleep preferences and quality of sleep was completed. Result(s): Forty-two patient interview surveys were completed (21 pre- and 21 post-intervention). Recall of sleep assessment completion upon admission to the ICU increased from 24% to 57%. Recall of implementation of identified sleep preferences increased from 15% to 68%. The median sleep quality score improved from 5 to 7 (0 to 10 scale). Delirium prevalence decreased from 40% to 8% (median 13%) over the first 8 weeks after implementation of the sleep program. Conclusion(s): A sleep promotion program including assessment of sleep disorders and sleep aids or habits can improve implementation of individual patient sleep preferences, improve satisfaction with sleep quality in the ICU and potentially decrease prevalence of delirium.

AB  - Objective. Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube insertion, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with tympanostomy tubes or being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting, as an intervention for otitis media of any type. Purpose. The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group broadly discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision making and care of children with existing tubes. Action Statements. The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic eardrops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration; (2) clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who did not receive tympanostomy tubes until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (5) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (9) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The development group provided the following options: (1) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms that are likely attributable to OME including, but not limited to, vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life and (2) clinicians may perform tympa-nostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for 3 months or longer (chronic OME). © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2013 Reprints and permission.

AB  - This study explored the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of rural and farm adolescents regarding hearing conservation strategies. This qualitative study took place at two high schools in rural Michigan. Twenty-five adolescents living and working on farms or living in rural areas participated in one of two focus groups. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analyzed by two researchers and checked by an additional researcher to ensure reliability. Noise exposure was ubiquitous among participants, both in farm-related (e.g., equipment, livestock) and non-farm-related (e.g., music, firearms) activities. Perceived barriers to use of hearing protection devices outweighed perceived benefits, resulting in uncommon use of protection. When hearing protection was used, it was usually earmuffs or earplugs. Participants indicated a lack of training in noise hazards and protective strategies. Despite their acknowledged risk of hearing loss, participants did not associate their use of hearing protection today with their hearing ability later in life. Categories emerging that relate to hearing protector use included: Barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, situational influences, impersonal influences, cues to action, susceptibility, and severity. Farm and rural adolescents are at risk for noise exposure and hearing loss. The findings stress the significance of work environment and adult modeling in facilitating hearing conservation behaviors. As indicated by the youths' recommendations, school-based interventions may be an effective approach to address this health concern. Intervention studies are needed to test various approaches that can effectively promote use of hearing conservation strategies among rural and farm adolescents.

AB  - Pender's health promotion model (HPM) has been revised, including substantial changes in its structure. The purpose of this study was to compare the fit and predictive usefulness of the original and revised structures of the HPM as applied to the use of hearing protection devices by 703 construction workers. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the two alternative forms of the model. Both forms of the model fit well, with the revised structure having a better fit and explaining more of the variance in use of hearing protection (28% vs. 18%). Results support the revised structure of the health promotion model (HPM) over the original form, and indicate it may be useful in understanding and predicting use of hearing protection. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of occupational exposure to noise and its relationship with other factors that can induce hearing loss in the electric plant workers of a petrochemical industry of the west of Venezuela. A cross-sectional study was conducted that included sonometry tests, carried out according to the established methodology by COVENIN rules, and the occupational medical evaluation and liminal tonal audiometrics test in 75 workers. The equivalent noise levels (Leq) was quantified in different workplaces. It was found out that most of the workers are exposed to high noise levels [>85 dB(A)] and during more time than the recommended. All workers use hearing protectors appropriately. The hearing loss prevalence in workers was 16.0%, there were not noise-induced hearing losses. The hearing threshold registered in the audiometrics test was diminished, but inside the normal threshold values. We diagnosed 12 cases of conductive hearing loss, all grade I; there were not sensorial or mixed hearing losses. There was not a relationship between the equivalent noise level and hearing loss. It is suggested the design and implantation of a program of auditory conservation to protect the health and security of the workers and to conduct a longitudinal study considering the findings of the present study as it basis. © 2006 Univarsidad del Zulia.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Workers in industries with impact noise, as well as soldiers exposed to supersonic blasts from armament and explosive devices, appear to be more at risk for hearing loss than are their counterparts exposed to continuous noise. Alternative considerations for hearing protection are dictated because of a disproportionately increased biophysical response in comparison to continuous noise. Impulse noise is a significant and distinct problem that requires a new strategy for hearing protection. A review of current clinical and occupational literature suggests that impulse noise may be more damaging than continuous sound. Statistical measurements such as kurtosis hold promise for the quantitative prediction of hearing loss. As sound energy to the cell increases, the mechanism of cochlear damage shifts from biochemical injury to mechanical injury. Outer hair cells appear to be more sensitive than inner hair cells to impulse noise because of their energy requirements, which lead to increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and self-destruction by apoptosis. Hearing protective devices currently in use for impulse noise include hunters' hearing devices, active noise-reduction headsets, and various in-ear plugs, including nonlinear reacting inserts. Existing equipment is hampered by the materials used and by present-day electronic technology. Antioxidants administered before sound exposure show promise in mitigating hearing loss in industrial and combat situations. New materials with improved damping, reflective, and absorption characteristics are required. Hearing protective devices that allow passage of ambient sound while blocking harmful noise might improve the compliance and safety of those exposed. Sensing devices that instantaneously and selectively hyperpolarize outer hair cells are discussed as alternate protection. © 2009 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Postural stability requires the integration of multisensory input information and translation into appropriate motor responses. Surprisingly, few previous studies have addressed the role of auditory input on postural stability in healthy subjects, and none has investigated this in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective(s): To assess the influence of the visual and auditory systems on postural stability in patients with AD and healthy subjects. Method(s): Twenty-four patients withADand healthy age-matched subjects were examined by kinematic postural analysis (inertia measurement units placed at the center of mass of the body) under four different conditions: stance with eyes open and eyes closed, with and without suppression of background noise (using ear defenders). The effects of visual and auditory influences were analyzed independently and in conjunction. Result(s): In both groups, visual suppression had a negative impact on postural stability, while suppression of background noise, non-specifically and without spatial cues, significantly benefited postural stability. We also observed that in both groups, the positive effect of background noise suppression was insufficient to compensate for the negative effect of visual suppression, to which the patients were significantly more vulnerable. Conclusion(s): Audition, albeit less significant than vision, also plays a role in the multi-sensorial dynamic control of postural stability by the central nervous system. In everyday life, audition is likely to be a relevant factor in postural stability. This is especially relevant in AD in which, even when the peripheral sensory system is intact, the central processing is impaired and sensory dependence is re-weighted.Copyright © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - To verify the effectiveness of an educational action in the form of training, emphasizing the importance of hearing protection for workers exposed to occupational noise. The study included 78 male individuals. All participants answered a questionnaire before they were submitted to audiological evaluation. For the second application of the questionnaire, participants were randomly divided into two groups: Research Group, constituted by 44 subjects that received educational training before the second questionnaire application, and Control Group, comprising 34 individuals that answered the questionnaire before the educational training. Training was based on material with graphic images and text, in the form of conversation. The topics covered included: the importance of hearing, noise effects on health, importance of preventing hearing loss and using hearing protection, conservation and cleaning of hearing protectors, levels of noise in the workplace and noise attenuation provided by hearing protectors. The questionnaire contained 14 multiple choice questions that addressed the same themes explored in the educational training. There was a significant increase of correct responses in the second application of the questionnaire, only in the Research Group, in all comparisons. Educational action performed with workers exposed to occupational noise are effective, and the questionnaire is a stable and viable tool to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs.

AB  - This study explored Latino construction workers' experiences with occupational noise and hearing protection to provide qualitative data to be used in designing an intervention to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. An ecological framework provided the theoretical foundation for this study. Fifteen Latino construction workers participated in one of four focus groups exploring perceptions of exposure to noise on the job and barriers to and supports for wearing hearing protection. Support for an ecological framework was apparent in the environmental and personal factors revealed in the data: how it feels, personal responsibility, they make us wear it, we don't care about ears, it won't happen to me, being Latino, keeping our jobs, hearing protection is uncomfortable, and we can handle it. Researchers are applying results of this study in the development of a hearing conservation intervention for Latino construction workers to be evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial.

AB  - Disturbed sleep and sleep deprivation is common in patients in critical care settings. Noise and inappropriate use of light/dark cycles are two of the causes of sleep interruptions. The purpose of the study was to evaluate eye masks and earplugs to help control patients' exposure to noise and light within the critical care environment. An intervention study using a two group post-test quasi-experimental design of high dependency patients within a cardiothoracic critical care unit was undertaken by a group of critical care nurses. Sleep assessment rating scales and open-ended questions were used to obtain patients' reported experiences of their sleep. Patients self-selected into either an intervention or non-intervention group. Sixty-four patients consented to take part in the study, 34 patients tried the interventions earplugs and eye masks and many found they improved sleep. However, noise was still a factor preventing sleep for both groups of patients. Mixed reports were found with the interventions from very comfortable to very uncomfortable. At a cost of 2.50 pounds sterling/patient, earplugs and eye masks were a relatively cheap intervention with notable improvements for some critically ill patients. Further research is required with a larger sample size, plus an examination of both earplugs and eye masks separately. Offering patient's earplugs and eye masks to improve sleep should be considered as a matter of routine nursing practice, this should include time to show patients how to use and try them out for comfort.

Method(s): Children aged 2 to 14 years admitted to PICU were randomized to intervention (IG: n=10) or control (CG: n=10) groups following Institutional Review Board approval. The comfort intervention consisted of: (1) parental soothing (touch and reading), and (2) earmuff application with music to reduce auditory stimulation. Comfort was assessed: (a) in PICU (Comfort scale, pain, sleep diaries), (b) on the wards (sleep actigraphy), and (c) 3 months post-discharge (anxiety, distress, sleep actigraphy). Intervention and methodological acceptability and feasibility were assessed via observation, measurement completion rates, semi-structured interviews, and telephone calls. Result(s): The intervention was acceptable to 100% of nurses. While 49% of parents approached agreed to participate, 70% and 100% of IG parents responded positively to the intervention's soothing and music components, respectively. Most IG parents (70%) and all nurses felt children responded positively to the intervention; all nurses felt it was feasible. Measurement response rates ranged from 85% to 100%. Pilot data suggest lower IG child anxiety scores, better sleep quality on wards and at home, and larger decreases in IG parent anxiety onwards. Conclusion(s): Methods: were acceptable and feasible, and children responded positively to the intervention. Result(s): support the development of a full-scale RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the comfort intervention.

AB  - Introduction: In order for a diagnosis of Occupational Hearing Loss (BK-no. 2301) to be made certain criteria must be fulfilled to establish that the hearing loss is occupational in origin. This work compares 2 groups, those who fulfil the criteria (BKE) and those who do not (BKNE). Method(s): A 100 consecutive reports (Larmgutachten BK-no. 2301) written by the authors were examined retrospectively. These recorded audiometric examination, an analysis of any tinnitus and noise exposure plus use of hearing protection. Pre- and post-noise exposure status together with an expert assessment of work limitations was made to produce a 7 point score. Result(s): 67% of the group fulfilled the conditions for occupational hearing loss (9% were entitled to compensation). In the BKE group 82% showed typical audiometric signs of noise damage with 75% of them fulfilling at least 6 criteria of occupational disease no. 2301. Tinnitus typical for noise exposure was found in 26%. Discussion(s): A 7 point score could be useful in the future as a method of helping distinguish hearing loss and tinnitus from occupational as opposed to other causes.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Concerts have long periods of intense sound with short break intervals. Hearing concerns are well known to performers; concertgoers largely ignore them. Preperformance and postperformance audiograms were compared to assess hearing threshold shifts with and without earplugs. METHOD(S): A prospective, randomized study in which 29 volunteers attended 3 concerts, encompassing 3 music genres. Audiograms, seating location, sound intensity, and earplug-use data were collected. Data were analyzed to determine frequency test-retest variability. RESULT(S): Sound levels averaged 99.8 dBA, and the maximum was 125.6 dBA. Sixty-four percent (9/14) of participants without earplugs showed significant threshold shifts compared with 27% (4/15) of those using earplugs. No significant differences existed between music genres or seating location. CONCLUSION(S): This study showed a high incidence of threshold shifts in unprotected concertgoers. Sound levels exceeded all Occupational Safety and Health Act rules despite standardized sound systems. A significant reduction in threshold shifts was seen with the use of earplugs.

AB  - Occupational noise is a significant contributor to disabling hearing loss worldwide. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has resulted in huge human and economic consequences costing New Zealand approximately $53M annually and rising. A high proportion of hearing loss claims are made by workers in the manufacturing sector. Hearing protection devices (HPDs) are used together with engineering and administrative controls to minimize noise exposure and to prevent hearing loss. Unfortunately, inconsistent and improper use of HPDs has hindered efforts to prevent NIHL. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors that influence the use of HPDs amongst a group of manufacturing workers in New Zealand. A purposive sample of twenty-five workers was recruited to take part in semi-structured interviews. The open-ended questions were aimed at exploring the participants' knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and behavior towards noise and HPDs. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and key themes emerged in relation to HPD use. Themes that emerged from the interviews either supported good hearing protection behavior or acted as barriers against it. Five major themes, (perception of noise, hearing preservation, reluctance to use HPDs, workplace interaction, and value of hearing) and sub-themes described various factors that influence hearing protection use. Both personal and environmental factors influence the use of HPDs. Based on this study, personal and environmental factors need to be targeted for further research using ecological models to develop interventions that promote HPD use amongst workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) remains an important occupational health issue as the second most commonly self-reported occupational injury or illness. The incorrect and inconsistent use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) compromises their effectiveness in preventing NIHL., AIMS: To describe the development of an easily administered yet robust questionnaire to investigate factors that influence HPD use., METHODS: A hearing protection assessment (HPA-2) questionnaire was developed using items based on themes identified in our previous research. These fell into two classes: supports and barriers to wearing HPD, which formed two scales within the questionnaire. The questionnaire, which also included demographic items, was administered to workers from 34 manufacturing companies. The internal consistency of the scales was tested, and factor analysis was conducted to investigate the underlying structure of the scales., RESULTS: Of the 1053 questionnaires distributed, 555 completed questionnaires were received giving a response rate of 53%. The Cronbach's alpha for the barriers scale (alpha = 0.740) and supports scale (alpha = 0.771) indicated strong internal reliability of the questionnaire. The supports and barriers were further described as five key factors (risk justification, HPD constraints, hazard recognition, behaviour motivation and safety culture) that influence hearing protection behaviour. Workers who reported always using HPDs had more supports across these factors, while those who did not always wear HPDs reported more barriers., CONCLUSIONS: The HPA-2 questionnaire may be useful in both research and interventions to understand and motivate hearing protection behaviour by identifying and targeting supports and barriers to HPD use at different levels of the ecological model.

AB  - Introduction: Pilots are exposed to potentially harmful levels of noise, the actual consequences of which are still poorly documented. We have determined the audiometric profiles of pilots as a function of age and type of aircraft (i.e., fighter, transport, helicopter) and have searched for risk factors of deafness other than noise in a pilot population. Method(s): We examined 521 French military pilots ages 20-40 yr during their annual medical check-ups. Pilots were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire and data from tonal audiograms of both ears were collected. Hearing levels were compared between groups of age and aircraft category. Result(s): Abnormal hearing levels in pilots were found essentially at high frequencies with a marked notch on audiograms at 6 kHz. Left ears had a significantly poorer performance compared with right ears. At a given age, transport pilots had, on average, better hearing at 8 kHz than other pilots, despite a higher number of flying hours. In addition to the 6 kHz notch, helicopter pilots showed a significant hearing loss at 3 kHz. Such an enlargement of the impaired frequency range can disturb speech communication. Prevalence of otitis media in childhood was significantly higher in pilots with abnormal hearing. Discussion(s): Pilots flying fighter and helicopter aircraft are at a higher risk of hearing loss compared with pilots flying transport aircraft. Improvements in ear protection seem particularly needed for the left ear. Hearing losses can potentially compromise speech communication in helicopter pilots.

AB  - The threat of noise-induced hearing loss is a serious concern for many workers. This study explores use of the transtheoretical model as a framework for defining stages of workers' acceptance of hearing protection devices. A secondary analysis was performed using a cross-section of data from a randomized, controlled clinical trial of an intervention to increase use of hearing protection. Use of hearing protection devices was well distributed across the theorized stages of change. Chi-square analysis and analysis of variance revealed significant differences between stages for the variables studied. Discrete stages of hearing protection device use can be identified, laying the foundation for further work investigating use of the transtheoretical model for promoting hearing protection device use. The model can provide a framework for tailoring interventions and evaluating their effects. With further development of the transtheoretical model, nurses may be able to easily identify workers' readiness to use hearing protection devices and tailor training toward that goal.

AB  - The 2000 United States Census reported significant growth in the number of Hispanic workers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, 1996) has identified noise-induced hearing loss as a significant occupational threat. Current theoretical models need to be evaluated for their utility with Hispanic workers. The Predictors for Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM) is a framework for increasing workers' use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Using regression analysis, the explained variance in HPD use by the model predictors was examined in a sample of 208 Hispanic factory workers. Explained variance was lower for Hispanics (R2 = .20) than for non-Hispanic Whites (R2 = .37). Further research with Hispanic workers is needed to improve the PUHPM fit.

AB  - A hybrid active noise reduction (ANR) architecture is presented and validated for a circumaural earcup and a communication earplug. The hybrid system combines source-independent feedback ANR with a Lyapunov-tuned leaky LMS filter (LyLMS) improving gain stability margins over feedforward ANR alone. In flat plate testing, the earcup demonstrates an overall C-weighted total noise reduction of 40 dB and 30-32 dB, respectively, for 50-800 Hz sum-of-tones noise and for aircraft or helicopter cockpit noise, improving low frequency (<100 Hz) performance by up to 15 dB over either control component acting individually. For the earplug, a filtered- X implementation of the LyLMS accommodates its nonconstant cancellation path gain. A fast time-domain identification method provides a high-fidelity, computationally efficient, infinite impulse response cancellation path model, which is used for both the filtered- X implementation and communication feedthrough. Insertion loss measurements made with a manikin show overall C-weighted total noise reduction provided by the ANR earplug of 46-48 dB for sum-of-tones 80-2000 Hz and 40-41 dB from 63 to 3000 Hz for UH-60 helicopter noise, with negligible degradation in attenuation during speech communication. For both hearing protectors, a stability metric improves by a factor of 2 to several orders of magnitude through hybrid ANR. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Farmers have high rates of hearing loss, yet little is known about the hearing status of migrant agricultural workers. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess the prevalence and impact of hearing loss in this population. METHOD(S): One hundred fifty migrant and seasonal agricultural workers were surveyed at a series of health fairs held at migrant camps. A bilingual questionnaire included items related to hearing loss risk factors and subjective hearing difficulties. Pure tone audiometry and tympanometry were performed in a mobile testing van. RESULT(S): More than half the subjects had some degree of hearing loss at audiometric frequencies between 500 and 6,000 Hz, especially in the higher frequencies. Hispanic males in the sample had significantly greater prevalence of high-frequency hearing loss compared to adults in the national Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). More than 35% of respondents complained of subjective difficulty hearing or understanding speech, yet no workers reported use of hearing aids. Even after adjusting for measured hearing loss, Hispanic farm workers were more likely than their English- speaking counterparts to complain of difficulty hearing or understanding speech, suggesting that language barriers could worsen the impact of hearing loss. Risk factors for hearing loss included age and abnormal tympanometry. Occupational exposures to noise from tractors and other machinery as well as pesticides were frequently reported, while use of hearing protection was rare. CONCLUSION(S): Hearing loss is a significant and under-recognized problem in the migrant worker population. Further preventive and treatment efforts are warranted.

AB  - Objectives: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is prevalent, yet evidence on the effectiveness of preventive interventions is lacking. The effectiveness of a new technology allowing workers to monitor daily at-ear noise exposure was analysed. Method(s): Workers in the hearing conservation program of an aluminium smelter were recruited because of accelerated rates of hearing loss. The intervention consisted of daily monitoring of at-ear noise exposure and regular feedback on exposures from supervisors. The annual rate of change in high frequency hearing average at 2, 3 and 4 KHz before intervention (2000-2004) and 4 years after intervention (2006-2009) was determined. Annual rates of loss were compared between 78 intervention subjects and 234 controls in other company smelters matched for age, gender and high frequency hearing threshold level in 2005. Result(s): Individuals monitoring daily noise exposure experienced on average no further worsening of high frequency hearing (average rate of hearing change at 2, 3 and 4 KHz=-0.5 dB/year). Matched controls also showed decelerating hearing loss, the difference in rates between the two groups being significant (p<0.0001). Analysis of a subset of intervention subjects matched to controls for initial rate of hearing loss showed a similar trend but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Conclusion(s): Monitoring daily occupational noise exposure inside hearing protection with ongoing administrative feedback apparently reduces the risk of occupational NIHL in industrial workers. Longer follow-up of these workers will help determine the significance of the intervention effect. Intervention studies for the prevention of NIHL need to include appropriate control groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the daily noise exposure of baristas working in cafes, and to measure their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding hearing conservation and perceptions of noise in their work environment., DESIGN: Fifteen baristas from six cafes in Portland completed the Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviors questionnaire, a sound disturbance survey, and a structured interview to document perceptions of noise in the work environment. To measure daily noise exposure, a subset of eight participants wore a personal dosimeter for three different work shifts., STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 11 females and four males, aged between 19 and 36 years old (mean: 26.3, SD: 4.6) recruited from independently owned cafes in the Portland metro area., RESULTS: Dosimetry measurements revealed Leq measurements between 71 and 83 dBA, with noise doses ranging from 4% to 74%, indicating that baristas are not exposed to sound levels above the regulatory criterion. Questionnaire results indicated that baristas have low awareness about the hazards of noise, are not opposed to hearing conservation, and rarely use hearing protection when engaged in noisy activities., CONCLUSIONS: Baristas here lacked the pertinent education and motivation to commit to invaluable hearing conservation practices.

AB  - This experiment investigated the effect of small-group versus individual hearing loss prevention (HLP) training on the attenuation performance of passive insert-type hearing protection devices (HPDs). A subject-fit (SF) methodology, which gave naive listeners access only to the instructions printed on the HPD product label, was used to determine real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) at third-octave noise bands between 125-8000 Hz. REAT measurements were augmented by use of the Hearing Loss Prevention Attitude-Belief (HLPAB) survey, a field-tested self-assessment tool developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, consisting of 25 listeners each, in a controlled behavioral-intervention trial. There were two types of HPDs (formable and premolded) and two training formats (individual and small group). A short multimedia program, including a practice session, was presented to all 100 listeners. Results showed training to have a significant effect, for both HPDs on real-ear attenuation and attitude, but, importantly, there was no difference between small-group and individual training. © 2007 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - Objectives: There are 575 000 licensed shotgun owners in the UK. When fired shotguns produce a peak sound pressure of over 150 dB, sufficient to cause irreparable damage to hearing. Unlike persons exposed to occupational noise, the use of hearing protection is not mandatory. We aimed to determine the prevalence of hearing disability amongst recreational shotgun users and to investigate attitudes to hearing protection within this group. Method(s): A questionnaire distributed by email to the membership of two gun clubs based in West Yorkshire. Data was collected with regard to the type of shooting pursued, the frequency and intensity of shotgun use and what hearing protection was employed. Participants were also asked to complete the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA), a questionnaire providing a validated measure of the impact of hearing problems on the individual's daily life. Persons with a history of occupational noise exposure were excluded from the study. Result(s): Of 95 questionnaires distributed, 56 eligible responses were received. Thirteen percent of responders rarely or never used hearing protection whilst shooting. The mean HHIA score for these individuals was 16/40 (95% CI 11-21), indicative of a moderate hearing disability. The mean score for those using hearing protection consistently was 6/40 (95% CI 3-8), indicative of no significant hearing disability. Conclusion(s): Hearing protection use amongst recreational shooters is inconsistent. A significantly higher burden of hearing disability is seen amongst inconsistent users of hearing protection (P = 0.0002). Educating shooters about the risks of noise induced hearing loss should be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: After presbycusis, noise exposure is considered the second cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Due to exposure to high-intensity sounds, musicians may be at risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Given the importance of good hearing in music career, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of hearing loss and use of protective measures among Iranian musicians., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 125 musicians, including 21 women (16.8%) and 104 men (83.2%), with at least five years of work experience were recruited. All participants underwent clinical and audiometric examinations. Demographic data, complaints about hearing loss, and information about the use of protective devices were collected through interviews., RESULTS: Audiometric notch in either one or both ears and bilateral hearing loss were present in respectively 42.4% and 19.2% of the participants. The history of tinnitus after performance and ear pain during performance was reported by 64 (51%) and 35 (28%) individuals, respectively. Less than 2% of the participants used hearing protection devices., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to loud sounds puts musicians at risk of hearing loss. However, due to their inadequate knowledge, most musicians never use protective devices to prevent damage to their auditory system.

AB  - The objectives of this investigation were to quantify noise exposures generated during a 1 hr trumpet practice session and to determine whether distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are affected by such exposure, to describe the distribution of intensity levels and temporal characteristics of noise produced by trumpet practice, and to determine the effect of earplug use on generated noise levels and DPOAEs. In experiment 1, eight college-age trumpeters underwent an otoscopic inspection, tympanometry, and pure-tone threshold testing. Using a Grason-Stadler 60 DPOAE system, DPOAEs were recorded just before a 1 hr practice session, at 2 min after the practice session, 4 min after the session, and at 4 min intervals thereafter for a total period of 1 hr. A Hewlett-Packard 3569A Real-Time Frequency Analyzer was used to integrate noise levels to assess the overall level of exposure averaged over the course of the hour. In experiment 2, seven different trumpeters participated in two data-collection sessions. The main difference between the sessions was that subjects wore E.A.R. earplugs during session 2. All other design parameters were similar to those of experiment 1. Noise levels generated during the practice sessions resulted in average Leqs of 95.96, 96.6, and 96.43 dB SPL. A sound-distribution analysis revealed that noise levels exceeded 85 dB for an average of 43.73 min per session. Mean Leq values did not change when subjects wore earplugs (96.6 dB SPL versus 96.43 dB SPL.) Predictions (ISO 1999) of the increased risk of hearing loss that trumpeters would experience at 40, 50, and 60 years of age were made and indicated that trumpeters are at a significantly increased risk of hearing loss over that contributable to age alone. This increased risk is apparent with as little as 1 hr of exposure per day and suggests that 60-year-old male and female musicians exposed to trumpet noise for 4 hr per day for 40 years would be 85% and 300%, respectively, more likely to have hearing loss than their peers with negative noise exposure histories. Statistically significant decreases in DPOAE amplitudes from the prenoise exposure collection point to the 2 min post exposure point were observed only when subjects were not wearing earplugs during their practice session. Recovery of DPOAEs to baseline level varied in form for four test frequencies. During solitary play, trumpeters generate noise levels that temporarily decrease DPOAE amplitudes and that by themselves have the potential to result in permanent noise-induced hearing loss. Trumpeters who practice/perform over a period of years should be concerned about the implications of their craft on their hearing and should be offered personalized hearing conservation programs. The use of earplugs offers a practical and cost-effective means of hearing protection and, for this group of trumpeters, did not lead to an increase in playing level.

AB  - The Italian decree 195/2006 incorporates the European Directive 2003/10/CE on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (noise). It is rather different to previous decree 277/1991, particularly as regard of the new exposure limit value and the elimination of annex VI and VII. We discus here only two aspects that we consider relevant and quite critical: 1) the calculation of the exposure limit values as noise equivalent level: it is a method that underestimates the potential damage of impulsive noise, so the risk evaluation remains quite inaccurate. 2) to take account of the attenuation provided by the individual hearing protectors worn by the worker in determining the worker's effective exposure when applying the exposure limit values: this must not apply to the obligations of employer to control the risk at source avoiding or reducing exposure to the minimum. Furthermore the attenuation power of individual hearing protectors is difficult to measure because his variability during the time and among different subjects. Then we evaluate and discus the new duties of Occupational Physician in this matter. The daily exposure limit values and action values are in fact in part modified as well as the methodology for organize the programs of prevention, health surveillance, information and formation of workers. As support for his activity we proposed the guidelines that The Italian Society of Occupational Health and Industrial Hygiene (SIMLII) has published in 2003, which provides recommendations for the health surveillance for the prevention of noise induced hearing loss at the workplace. © PI-ME, Pavia 2006.

AB  - Dynamic balance abilities of collegiate men for the bench press. J Strength Cond Res 26(12): 3225-3229, 2012-This study investigated the dynamic balance detection ability of college men for the bench press exercise. Thirty-five college men (mean +/- SD: age = 22.4 +/- 2.76 years, bench press experience = 8.3 +/- 2.79 years, and estimated 1RM = 120.1 +/- 21.8 kg) completed 1 repetition of the bench press repetitions for each of 3 bar loading arrangements. In a randomized fashion, subjects performed the bench press with a 20-kg barbell loaded with one of the following: a balanced load, one 20-kg plate on each side; an imbalanced asymmetrical load, one 20-kg plate on one side and a 20-kg plate plus a 1.25-kg plate on the other side; or an imbalanced asymmetrical center of mass, 20-kg plate on one side and sixteen 1.25-kg plates on the other side. Subjects were blindfolded and wore ear protection throughout all testing to decrease the ability to otherwise detect loads. Binomial data analysis indicated that subjects correctly detected the imbalance of the imbalanced asymmetrical center of mass condition (p[correct detection] = 0.89, p < 0.01) but did not correctly detect the balanced condition (p[correct detection] = 0.46, p = 0.74) or the imbalanced asymmetrical condition (p[correct detection] = 0.60, p = 0.31). Although it appears that a substantial shift in the center of mass of plates leads to the detection of barbell imbalance, minor changes of the addition of 1.25 kg (2.5 lb) to the asymmetrical condition did not result in consistent detection. Our data indicate that the establishment of a biofeedback loop capable of determining balance detection was only realized under a high degree of imbalance. Although balance detection was not present in either the even or the slightly uneven loading condition, the inclusion of balance training for upper body may be futile if exercises are unable to establish such a feedback loop and thus eliciting an improvement of balance performance. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - Angiogenesis/angiostasis regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1A (HIF- 1A)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/inhibitor of growth protein 4 (ING-4) axis may be crucial for the course and outcome of sarcoidosis. Overexpression of angiogenic factors (activation of VEGF through HIF-1A) may predispose to chronic course and lung fibrosis, whereas immunoangiostasis (related to an overexpression of inhibitory ING-4) may be involved in granuloma formation in early sarcoid inflammation, or sustained or recurrent formation of granulomas. In this work we investigated gene expression of HIF-1A, VEGF and ING-4 in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) cells and in peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes of sarcoidosis patients (n = 94), to better understand mechanisms of the disease and to search for its biomarkers. The relative gene expression level (RQ value) was analyzed by qPCR. The results were evaluated according to the presence of lung parenchymal involvement (radiological stage I vs. II-IV), acute vs. insidious onset, lung function tests, calcium metabolism parameters, percentage of lymphocytes (BALL %) and BAL CD4+/CD8+ in BALF, age, and gender. In BALF cells, the ING-4 and VEGF RQ values were increased, while HIF-1A expression was decreased. In PB lymphocytes all studied genes were overexpressed. Higher expression of HIF-1A in PB lymphocytes of patients with abnormal spirometry, and in BALF cells of patients with lung volume restriction was found. VEGF gene expression in BALF cells was also higher in patients with abnormal spirometry. These findings were in line with previous data on the role of HIF-1A/VEGF/ING-4 axis in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. Up-regulated HIF-1A and VEGF genes are linked to acknowledged negative prognostics.Copyright © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose of review: To summarize relevant literature occurring over the past 12-18 months forwarding understanding of noiseinduced hearing loss in relation to military service. Recent findings: Hearing loss prior to entry into military service is highly predictive of subsequent hearing loss and hearing loss disability. Tightly controlled organic solvent exposure may not be a significant risk factor for noiseinduced hearing loss. Increasingly detailed analysis of high intensity noise, impulse and blast noise exposures, and the methods used to mitigate these exposures are leading to breakthroughs in understanding and predicting hearing loss in military service. Summary: Prevention, mitigation, treatment, and prediction of the effects of hazardous noise exposure in military service continue to require a multidisciplinary team of individuals from around the world fully aware of the detrimental effect to service members and their societies of hearing loss disability.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The outer hair cells of the organ of Corti are the target of abundant efferent projections from the olivocochlear system. This peripheral efferent auditory subsystem is currently thought to be modulated by central activity via corticofugal descending auditory system, and to modulate active cochlear micromechanics. Although the function of this efferent subsystem remains unclear, physiological, psychophysical, and modeling data suggest that it may be involved in ear protection against noise damage and auditory perception, especially in the presence of background noise. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that its activity is modulated by auditory and visual attention. A commonly used approach to measure olivocochlear activity noninvasively in humans relies on the suppression of otoacoustic emissions by contralateral noise. Previous studies have found substantial interindividual variability in this effect, and statistical differences have been observed between professional musicians and non-musicians, with stronger bilateral suppression effects in the former. In this paper, we review these studies and discuss various possible interpretations for these findings, including experience-dependent neuroplasticity. We ask whether differences in olivocochlear function between musicians and non-musicians reflect differences in peripheral auditory function or in more central factors, such as top-down attentional modulation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of our study was to identify the main factors associated with objective noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), as indicated by abnormal audiometric testing, in Spanish workers exposed to occupational noise in the construction industry. We carried out a prospective study in Tenerife, Spain, using 150 employees exposed to occupational noise and 150 age-matched controls who were not working in noisy environments. The variables analyzed included sociodemographic data, noise-related factors, types of hearing protection, self-report hearing loss, and auditory-related symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, vertigo). Workers with pathological audiograms had significantly longer noise-exposure duration (16.2 +/- 11.4 years) relative to those with normal audiograms (10.2 +/- 7.0 years; t = 3.99, P < 0.001). The vast majority of those who never used hearing protection measures had audiometric abnormalities (94.1%). Additionally, workers using at least one of the protection devices (earplugs or earmuffs) had significantly more audiometric abnormalities than those using both protection measures simultaneously (Chi square = 16.07; P < 0.001). The logistic regression analysis indicates that the use of hearing protection measures [odds ratio (OR) = 12.30, confidence interval (CI) = 4.36-13.81, P < 0.001], and noise-exposure duration (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.08-1.99, P = 0.040) are significant predictors of NIHL. This regression model correctly predicted 78.2% of individuals with pathological audiograms. The combined use of hearing protection measures, in particular earplugs and earmuffs, associates with a lower rate of audiometric abnormalities in subjects with high occupational noise exposure. The use of hearing protection measures at work and noise-exposure duration are best predictive factors of NIHL. Auditory-related symptoms and self-report hearing loss do not represent good indicators of objective NIHL. Routine monitoring of noise levels and hearing status are of great importance as part of effective hearing conservation programs.

AB  - Several studies indicate that the noise generated by performing orthopedic surgery has the potential to cause hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss was found in 50% of the orthopedic surgeons studied using audiometric testing, with a greater incidence associated with years of practice. Noise produced by several orthopedic surgical instruments such as saws, drills, and hammers during surgery exceeds 100 dB, especially during knee replacement procedures. In one study, surgical space suits (personal protection systems) were suggested to help protect against noise-induced hearing loss, although space suit manufacturers do not market them as noise-reduction devices. A research protocol was developed to determine if commercially available surgical space suits help to reduce noise at the surgeon's ear. With the commercially available personal protection systems used in this research, there was no significant extra-helmet noise decrease by wearing the space suit. Sound inside the helmet at the level of the ear averaged 61dBA, approximately the level of conversational speech, which may explain the difficulty the surgical staff may have hearing speech in the operating room when the space suit is worn with the fan on. If surgical noise is to be decreased, earplugs or muffs must be worn not only by the surgeon, but also by all personnel in the operating theater. At greatest risk may be the anesthesiologist, who may experience several orthopedic surgeries in a single day and is positioned close to the patient. Copyright © 2009 SLACK Incorporated.

AB  - Objective: Music-induced hearing loss is a growing public health concern. Potential contributors include intentional exposure to loud music volume and lack of awareness about potential hearing damage. We wanted to evaluate current trends in music listening behaviors, perception of personal risk, and hearing loss education in 2 musically inclined demographics. Method(s): An anonymous online 89-question survey instrument was made available to a convenience sample of visitors on both VH1.com and CMT.com Web sites. Respondents were queried about attitudes and behaviors related to hearing protection and noise exposure. A P < .05 value was used for independent t and z tests. Result(s): Total respondents: 1601. The minority of respondents felt hearing loss created a personal problem (19%), yet 43% had experienced hearing related issues. Respondents under 21 displayed potentially more harmful listening behaviors and symptoms of hearing loss, particularly with MP3 player use (P < .05). Popular media was the most informative source about hearing loss; 56% learned about hearing loss on television, 36% on the Internet, and 29% in a magazine. Most respondents reported willingness to adopt ear protective behaviors if educated by a clinician (71%) or informed that even limited exposure to excessively loud music can cause permanent damage (69%). Conclusion(s): Respondents 21 years old or younger reported significantly less education about potential hearing damage and were more likely to engage in riskier listening behavior. Healthcare providers retain significant ability to influence individual listening health and the media.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess sound exposure and the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in orchestral musicians. Material(s) and Method(s): Questionnaire inquiries and sound pressure level measurements were carried out in 63 musicians. Based on these data the risk assessment of the NIHL was performed according to ISO 1999:1990 (PN-ISO 1999:1990). Result(s): The classical orchestral musicians are usually exposed to sound at equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels of 81-90 dB (10-90th percentile), for 20-48 h (10-90th percentile) per week. Occupational exposures to such sound levels over 40 years of employment cause the risk of hearing impairment (expressed as mean hearing threshold level for 2, 3 and 4 kHz equal or greater than 25 dB) in the range of 13-33% and 9-33% in females and males, respectively. The highest risk is related to playing clarinet (up to 33%), tube (up to 34%), trumpet (up to 37%), trombone (up to 40%), percussion section (up to 41%) and horn (up to 47%). About 46% of respondents noticed hearing impairment. Nearly every fifth musician complained of tinnitus while almost half (48%) of them - of hyperacusis. However, only 14% of musicians declared present or past usage of hearing protective devices (HPDs) while over twice of them (30%) intended to use HPDs in the future. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

AB  - Occupational noise-induced hearing loss is the second most self-reported occupational illness or injury in the United States. Among coal miners, more than 90% of the population reports a hearing deficit by age 55. In this formative evaluation, focus groups were conducted with coal miners in Appalachia to ascertain whether miners perceive hearing loss as a major health risk and if so, what would motivate the consistent wearing of hearing protection devices (HPDs). The theoretical framework of the Extended Parallel Process Model was used to identify the miners' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and current behaviors regarding hearing protection. Focus group participants had strong perceived severity and varying levels of perceived susceptibility to hearing loss. Various barriers significantly reduced the self-efficacy and the response efficacy of using hearing protection.

AB  - The article concerns prevalence and causes of occupational neurosensory hypoacusis (ONH) in transport workers exposed to intensive industrial noise. Most often ONH is diagnosed in civil aviation air crews and railway locomotive crews aged 45-50 years with service history 15 years and longer. Because ONH morbidity has a trend to rise, it is necessary to update medical criteria of professional fitness and rules of medical examination of transport workers, especially those engaged in safety control. International classifications and scientific approaches may be considered. Innovations in noise reduction, modern hearing protection measures, early diagnosis and rehabilitation must be promoted.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the effect of live and recorded perioperative music therapy on anesthesia requirements, anxiety levels, recovery time, and patient satisfaction in women experiencing surgery for diagnosis or treatment of breast cancer. Patients and Methods Between 2012 and 2014, 207 female patients undergoing surgery for potential or known breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either patient-selected live music (LM) preoperatively with therapist-selected recorded music intraoperatively (n = 69), patient-selected recorded music (RM) preoperatively with therapist-selected recorded music intraoperatively (n = 70), or usual care (UC) preoperatively with noise-blocking earmuffs intraoperatively (n = 68). Results The LM and the RM groups did not differ significantly from the UC group in the amount of propofol required to reach moderate sedation. Compared with the UC group, both the LM and the RM groups had greater reductions (P < .001) in anxiety scores preoperatively (mean changes [and standard deviation: -30.9 [36.3], -26.8 [29.3], and 0.0 [22.7]), respectively. The LM and RM groups did not differ from the UC group with respect to recovery time; however, the LM group had a shorter recovery time compared with the RM group (a difference of 12.4 minutes; 95% CI, 2.2 to 22.5; P = .018). Satisfaction scores for the LM and RM groups did not differ from those of the UC group. Conclusion Including music therapy as a complementary modality with cancer surgery may help manage preoperative anxiety in a way that is safe, effective, time-efficient, and enjoyable.Copyright © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB  - Hospitals are places that allow patients to rest and recover, and therefore must be quiet inside and in the surrounding neighborhood. One medical center was chosen as a sample hospital. This hospital was a tertiary care center during the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan. The measurement results show that the noise level in the wards and stations was between 50.3 and 68.1 dB which exceeded the suggested hospital ward sound level. The quietest units were the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and recovery rooms with a noise level lower than 50 dB during the night. The higher noise levels were in the hall and pharmacy which were highly populated areas. This study analyzed the causes of this excessive noise and used noise reduction methods. The paired t test was performed and the results showed improvement methods were successful. This study found the noise levels reached 98.5-107.5 dB in power generator rooms and air-conditioning facilities, and suggests employees use ear plugs.

AB  - Background: Repeated exposure to excessive noise will eventually lead to an irreversible increase in hearing thresholds. In theory, the damage reflects both the intensity of the noise and the duration of exposure. This is not linear with respect to duration of exposure; rather, the worker may experience a disproportionate loss in the early years of exposure. Method(s): A prospective study surveying workers of the production section (i.e. most noise-exposed area) of a bottling factory was carried out in December 2003 and in December 2005. A self-administered questionnaire was used to extract information about worker's demographic characteristics, drug intake, and medical and occupational history, as well as information on the use of hearing protection devices. Noise mapping of the various departments of the factory was carried out. Otological examination, tympanometry and audiometry were also carried out on selected subjects. Result(s): Eighty-four workers, 76 (90.5 per cent) men and eight (9.5 per cent) women, were studied. Their mean age was 33.0 +/- 7.6 years in 2003 and 35.0 +/- 7.6 years in 2005. The recorded noise levels in the factory production section ranged between 91.5 and 98.7 dBA. The prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among workers was noted to be 64.9 and 86.9 per cent for test one (2003) and test two (2005), respectively. The degree of hearing deterioration within the two years of this study was 1.0 - 3.2 dB for the right ear and 1.6 - 3.4 dB for the left ear. This deterioration was at discrete frequencies. More than half (53.6 per cent) of the workers did not have a hearing protection device. Of the 46.4 per cent who did, only 38.5 per cent claimed to have used it regularly. Interpretation(s): These findings showed that there was a high prevalence of mild sensorineural hearing loss and significant hearing deterioration among workers, due to exposure to excessive noise over a two-year period. The study demonstrates the practical importance of serial audiometry for noise-exposed workers as a means of monitoring hearing deterioration. It is necessary to enforce existing occupational health laws in our industries in order to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, since it is eminently preventable. © 2008 JLO (1984) Limited.

AB  - Introduction. It is generally agreed that impulse noise that occurs mainly in industrial processes, military forces and recretional target practice und hunting is especially hazardous to the ear. From the physical point of view the phenomenon is defined as an acoustic pressure disturbance of short duration less than 1 sec and high intensity with the peak sound pressure levels greater than 100 dB SPL. Materials and methods. The study included 80 subjects (160 ears) aged 19-23 with correct tympanic membrane and thresholds measured by pure tone audiometry less than 20 dB. There were divided into two groups: I comprised 40 recruit soldiers put to the shooting training and group II consisted of 40 recruit soldiers using hearing protectors during shooting. Transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) measurements were performed by ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3-5 min before shooting and then 2 min, 1, 2 and 3 hours respectively after shooting in both groups. Results. it was found that the gunshot impulse noise from kbk AKM4S rifle caused in group 1 temporary hearing threshold shift (TTS) for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kHz frequencies of 1,07; 0,96; 1,41; 0,88 and 1,25 dB SPL respectively. TTS turned out to be maximum at 4 and 5 kHz and minimum at 1 and 2 kHz. In group II the soldiers used ear-muffs post-exposure changes were not significant. Conclusions. Short-term impulse noise generated by the rifle gunshots induced threshold shift of hearing. The usage of hearing protectors should be highly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms should be highly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms. © 2007 by Polskie Towarzystwo Otorynolaryngologow - Chirurgow Glowy i Szyi.

AB  - Purpose: To determine how amplified ear-muffs affect the intelligibility of speech in noise for people with hearing loss, and to determine how various brands of amplified earmuffs compare in terms of speech intelligibility and electroacoustic response. Method(s): The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) was used to measure the intelligibility of speech for 10 participants with hearing loss when they listened in a background of recorded industrial noise at 85 dBA. Participants listened with 3 different sets of amplified earmuffs (Peltor Tactical 7-S, Elvex COM 55, and Bilsom 707 Impact II), with a set of passive earmuffs (E-A-R Ultra 9000), and with ears unoccluded. Two measurements of sentence threshold were obtained under each of the 5 listening conditions. Gain was measured electroacoustically across a range of input levels and frequencies for each amplified earmuff. Result(s): Electroacoustic measurements indicated that each electronic earmuff amplified at low input levels and attenuated at high input levels. However, gain characteristics varied greatly across devices. HINT sentence thresholds were not significantly different across the 5 listening conditions or across the 2 trials. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that each type of earmuff can be used to reduce the noise exposure of people with hearing loss without compromising their ability to understand speech. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

AB  - Objectives: To study exposure to noise, the attitudes and knowledge towards noise-induced hearing loss and the actual use of hearing protection in a steel rolling mill in Nigeria. Method(s): A structured questionnaire was administered to 116 randomly selected workers to collect information relating to their knowledge and attitudes towards hazardous occupational noise and preventative measures. Noise mapping of the factory was also carried out. Result(s): Time weighted average noise levels were: administrative area 49 dBA, mechanic/maintenance workshop 72 dBA, mill floor 86 dBA and finishing stage 93 dBA. There was high awareness of the hazard of noise to hearing (93%) and of methods of prevention (92%) but only 27% possessed hearing protectors and only 28% of these stated that they used them all the time. Conclusion(s): While noise is recognized as a hazard, initiatives are required to increase use of effective preventative measures. © The Author 2005.

AB  - Knowledge and attitude of infantry soldiers to hearing conservation. Objective(s): This study examined British infantry soldiers' knowledge of hearing conservation and explored the various factors that influenced their behavior. Method(s): This followed qualitative methodology. Data were collected through focus group discussion and semistructured interviews. Twenty-three soldiers from a typical infantry unit were involved in this study. Data analysis involved both question and content analysis. Validity of the research instrument and reliability were ensured. Result(s): All of the soldiers felt their hearing could be affected by their job. Even though many were not aware of the presence of a hearing conservation policy, they knew about specific aspects of the policy. A number of factors prevented the proper use of the personal hearing protection devices even though they were aware of their effectiveness in the reduction of noise hazard. These included communication difficulties, discomfort, and the impracticability of using them in certain circumstances. There was also a suggestion of a preponderance of noise-induced hearing loss on the left, which is the side often left unprotected to aid communication. Suggestions were put forward on ways of improving the hearing conservation program. Conclusion(s): An effective Army hearing conservation program should be comprehensive. It should incorporate appropriate knowledge, sociological issues, and economic considerations such as choice making and opportunity cost. There should be a well-structured hearing education program with targeted and appropriate behavioral modification. It should be compulsory and include lectures and videos given at least once a year. Improvements are required to increase the proper use of personal hearing protection devices and thus reduce the morbidity associated with noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Objectives: This prospective study aimed to investigate the quality of life of workers in a steel factory. Method(s): The study group was composed of 16 male workers with tinnitus and 30 ears. Fifteen male workers without tinnitus and 30 ears were included into the control group. Workers were evaluated by questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry, and the SF-36 Health Survey. In the study group, tinnitus loudness levels (TLLs) were found. Result(s): In the study group, the domains general mental health and role limitations owing to emotional problems were significantly lower than in the control group. Older age, industrial noise exposure over a long period, higher noise exposure during work, and hearing loss secondary to occupational noise caused workers to experience higher TLLs. Earheadings protected workers more than earplugs, and TLLs were lower. Important factors that affect workers' quality of life are maximum exposed noise levels, daily and total noise exposure time, and exposure to continuous noise. Occupational noise-induced tinnitus mainly causes emotional disability rather than physical disability. Emotionally impaired QOL results may be due to tinnitus-related psychological problems. Conclusion(s): Workers should have knowledge about the hazardous effects of noise. Periodic health checkups and regular seminars have great importance. Workers must be aware of other ototoxic factors, such as medications and noisy music. In the future, researchers should develop a screening method to detect those with a more hereditary affinity to hearing loss.

AB  - Background: Patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL) experience great difficulty listening to speech in noisy environments. A directional microphone (DM) could potentially improve speech recognition in this difficult listening environment. It is well known that DMs in behind-the-ear (BTE) and custom hearing aids can provide a greater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in comparison to an omnidirectional microphone (OM) to improve speech recognition in noise for persons with hearing impairment. Studies examining the DMin bone anchored auditory osseointegrated implants (Baha), however, have been mixed, with little to no benefit reported for the DM compared to an OM. Purpose(s): The primary purpose of this study was to determine if there are statistically significant differences in the mean reception threshold for sentences (RTS in dB) in noise between the OM and DM in the Baha DivinoTM. The RTS of these two microphone modes was measured utilizing two loudspeaker arrays (speech from 0degree and noise from 180degree or a diffuse eight-loudspeaker array) and with the better ear open or closed with an earmold impression and noise attenuating earmuff. Subjective benefit was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) to compare unaided and aided (Divino OM and DM combined) problem scores. Research Design: A repeated measures design was utilized, with each subject counterbalanced to each of the eight treatment levels for three independent variables: (1) microphone (OM and DM), (2) loudspeaker array (180degree and diffuse), and (3) better ear (open and closed). Study Sample: Sixteen subjects with USNHL currently utilizing the Baha were recruited from Washington University's Center for Advanced Medicine and the surrounding area. Data Collection and Analysis: Subjects were tested at the initial visit if they entered the study wearing the Divino or after at least four weeks of acclimatization to a loaner Divino. The RTS was determined utilizing Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentences in the R-SpaceTM system, and subjective benefit was determined utilizing the APHAB. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a paired samples t-test were utilized to analyze results of the HINT and APHAB, respectively. Result(s): Results revealed statistically significant differences within microphone (p < 0.001; directional advantage of 3.2 dB), loudspeaker array (p = 0.046; 180degree advantage of 1.1 dB), and better ear conditions (p < 0.001; open ear advantage of 4.9 dB). Results from the APHAB revealed statistically and clinically significant benefit for the Divino relative to unaided on the subscales of Ease of Communication (EC) (p = 0.037), Background Noise (BN) (p < 0.001), and Reverberation (RV) (p = 0.005). Conclusion(s): The Divino's DM provides a statistically significant improvement in speech recognition in noise compared to the OM for subjects with USNHL. Therefore, it is recommended that audiologists consider selecting a Baha with a DM to provide improved speech recognition performance in noisy listening environments.

AB  - Introduction: Noise levels from military aircraft range from 100-130 dBA. Peak pressure levels from large caliber weapons may reach 180 dB SPL. To protect against hearing loss, individuals are encouraged to wear double hearing protection. This study determined ways to maximize benefit. Method(s): Hearing thresholds from 0.25-8 kHz and consonant discrimination were assessed in normal-hearing subjects with ears unoccluded and fitted with highly rated earmuffs and earplugs, singly or in combination. The earplugs were available in two sizes. Selection was based on best fit. Attenuation values were derived from the threshold measurements. Result(s): With the muff, plug, and muff and plug in combination, thresholds ranged from 35-48 dB SPL, 40-55 dB SPL, and 44-66 dB SPL, respectively, across the frequencies tested. The combination (without regard to size of plug) resulted in attenuation values of 38-54 dB. With the smaller of the two plugs, low-frequency values as high as 53-61 dB were realized. Consonant discrimination decreased by 6-8% with the devices worn singly and by 22% with the devices in combination, relative to unoccluded listening. Discussion(s): Sufficient low-frequency attenuation may be achieved with muffs and plugs in combination to prevent hearing loss from operational noise. Attenuation may be maximized by choosing a smaller earplug to achieve a better fit. Possible downsides are reduced detection of warning sounds and speech intelligibility. To be heard warning sounds should surpass protected thresholds by at least 5 dB. Choosing devices which provide somewhat less attenuation may be necessary to preserve communication capability. © by Aerospace Medical Association.

AB  - Orchestral musicians-an at-risk group for noise-induced hearing loss-have consistently reported great difficulty using hearing protection while performing or rehearsing, even when using earplugs specifically designed for musicians. A recent innovation in this field has been electronic earplugs that claim to deliver very high quality sound and only attenuate when sound levels become excessive. This study investigated these claims, aiming to determine whether professional orchestral musicians were able to use these devices and whether they were preferred to existing earplugs. Initially clinical and laboratory testing was carried out on the devices, indicating some spectral alteration of processed sound occurred, however claims of attenuation properties were validated. Following this, 26 orchestral musicians used the devices during rehearsals and performances for at least four weeks, providing feedback throughout this period. While musicians preferred the devices to previous earplugs, they identified issues including difficulty with orchestral balance, perception of dynamics and quality of sound provided by the devices. Results indicate these earplugs are a very positive step towards a usable hearing conservation tool for orchestral musicians to use in conjunction with other risk mitigation measures.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Hearing conservation and noise exposure management for professional orchestras is a difficult issue resistant to standard control measures as used in other industries with excessive noise problems. Although there has been a great deal of research into this area in terms of the audiological status of musicians and their exposure to noise, there are relatively few industry-specific strategies that can be adopted by an orchestra looking to address these issues. Australia does not have a uniform approach to hearing conservation management in its orchestras; however, each orchestra actively grapples with the challenges of balancing legal, practical, and artistic concerns. This study systematically investigated hearing conservation practices, noise exposure management, and audiological screening protocols in eight professional orchestras. The research involved personal interviews with staff at each orchestra, including inspection of venues and facilities. While all these orchestras were aware of the risks and were actively taking significant steps to reduce noise exposure, a range of approaches, with varying degrees of effectiveness and understanding of the issue, were found across the sector. There was limited evidence of educational programs for either the musicians at risk of excessive noise exposure or the staff responsible for devising and implementing control measures. In addition, the reported use of adequate personal hearing protection by musicians was poor. As Australia has recently introduced a national approach to workplace health and safety, a similar approach to noise and audiological management across the country's orchestral sector is proposed, drawn from existing research and practice. This will enable both consistent procedures and meaningful dialogue between the orchestras on the topics of hearing conservation, audiological monitoring, and educational practices.

AB  - It is broadly acknowledged that professional orchestral musicians risk noise-induced hearing pathologies due to sound exposure in rehearsal and performance. While much has been published regarding orchestral sound levels, little is known of the sound exposure these musicians experience during solitary practice, despite the many hours they spend engaged in this activity. This study aimed to determine sound exposure during solitary practice of 35 professional orchestral musicians, representing players of most orchestral instruments. To allow cross-comparison, participants were assessed playing similar repertoire in a controlled environment, recording simultaneously at each ear to determine sound exposure levels. Sound levels were recorded between 60 and 107 dB LAeq, with peak levels between 101 and 130 dB L C,peak. For average reported practice durations (2.1 h per day, five days a week) 53% would exceed accepted permissible daily noise exposure in solitary practice, in addition to sound exposure during orchestral rehearsals and performances. Significant inter-aural differences were noted in violin, viola, flute/piccolo, horn, trombone, and tuba. Only 40% used hearing protection at any time while practicing. These findings indicate orchestral musicians at risk of noise-induced hearing loss in ensemble face significant additional risks during solitary practice. Data presented will enable more effective and targeted management strategies for this population. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Background: In developing countries, 6% of deaths are due to cancer but cancer prevention is not practiced. Humans can prevent themselves from a number of workplace and environmental carcinogens. Objective(s): To assess exposure to carcinogens, risky behaviours and associated preventive methods. Method(s): A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on carcinogen exposure in the workplace and environment through trained field staff from volunteers after gaining informed consent. Data was analysed using SPSS. Result(s): Participants were exposed to recognized carcinogens and environmental hazards. Thirty-five (83.3%) [95% CI: 72.0-94.6] participants knew the carcinogen names they were exposed to. Common hygienic practices such as taking a bath and washing work dresses at the workplace, use of detergents to wash hands, and no smoking or eating at the workplace were poor. Twenty-nine (69.0%) [95% CI: 47.0 - 75.0] participants could smell the carcinogenic chemicals they use. Thirty (71.4%) [95% CI: 65.0 - 77.0] participants had been instructed in the use of protective equipment against carcinogens. Participants used preventive devices like hand gloves, laboratory coats, boots, face masks, goggles, ear plugs and respirators. Conclusion(s): Exposure to carcinogens is common necessitating case-control and cohort studies in this locality on cancer prevalence and incidence.

AB  - High noise exposure is anticipated to be present in the aircraft maintenance operations in civil aviation sector. The objective of the present study is the assessment of noise exposure and hearing threshold of the aircraft maintenance workers in this sector. Noise levels were measured in the aircraft hangers and in the workshops at a main international airport in Saudi Arabia. Two hundred aircraft maintenance workers were subjected to pure tone audiometry. The average Leq,8h at most of the aircraft maintenance operations was considerably high and most of the workers (89.5%) were exposed to noise levels >=85dBA. Frequency analysis of sound pressure levels revealed that the contribution of the octave bands 1, 2 and 4kHz to the overall noise level was high. The audiograms of the examined workers showed significant hearing impairment as compared to non-noise-exposed Saudi employees. Although the observed excessive noise levels can cause hearing loss, the effect among the studied aircraft maintenance workers was mild. This might be attributed to the usage of hearing protection devices, the intermittent nature of the workers' exposure to noise and job rotation. Statistical analysis revealed significant association of both age and usage of hearing protectors with hearing loss. The effect of exposure duration on hearing loss was also detected. Relevance to industry: Unlike military aircraft maintenance workers, exposure of civilian workers to noise is not sufficiently addressed. The data presented in this study may be used to set appropriate measures for hearing protection among those workers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exposure to intense noises during a short time can be responsible for permanent damage of the inner ear, even after an isolated exposure. Amplified music (discos, concert rooms) is the first cause of acute acoustic traumas among the young people. Acute acoustic traumas need urgent management and treatment. Exposure to high noise levels during a long time can lead to a progressive and insidious impairment of the inner ear, the hearing loss appearing obvious only after several months or years. Noise-induced hearing loss is irreversible. The functional consequences of acoustic traumas can be socially disabling and can have an important psychological impact. The prevention is based on the information of the patients, notably of the youngest ones, and on the wearing of hearing protectors at the time of risky situations.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. Military personnel are at especially high risk due to the broad range of military noise hazards and the frequency of exposure. Hearing protectors are vital for this particular workforce, yet they can impede the ability to understand necessary communication in the field. Level-dependent hearing protectors are designed to protect the auditory system from the hazards of impulse noise, while preserving the ability to hear speech and other important auditory signals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different passive, level-dependent earplugs (Combat Arms Earplugs; Sonic II Ear valves) on speech understanding of normal-hearing listeners in the presence of low-level background noise. The Combat Arms Earplug, developed specifically for use by military personnel, represented devices that attenuate impulse noise using small orifices and the Sonic II ear valve represented devices using an internal diaphragm. This study used a repeated-measures experimental design. Four scrambled lists of each of the four Northwestern University No. 6 50-word lists were presented in random order at 65 dB SPL in the presence of quiet and two different types of background noise: multitalker and military vehicle noise; using three ear conditions: NP (open ear), CA (Combat Arms Earplugs), and SO (Sonic II earplugs); and three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): -10, 0, and +10 dB. Word recognition scores (WRSs) of 18 native English-speaking adults with normal hearing sensitivity were measured in all test conditions. The percentage of words correctly repeated was used to determine differences between the two different level-dependent devices, types of background noise, and SNRs. Results showed a statistically significant increase in WRS as SNR increased from -10 to +10 dB. A repeated-measures analysis of variance for ear condition x noise x SNR indicated a significant main effect for SNR but not for type of noise or ear condition. A slight but significant interaction was found for SNR and ear condition. SNR had great impact on the ability of listeners to understand speech in the presence of background noise; however, the type of noise and the type of level-dependent device used did not. The results of the study support the notion that individuals potentially subjected to high-level impulse noise should be able to use level-dependent earplugs in low-level continuous noise without compromising speech understanding. More specifically, the passive, level-dependent earplugs currently used by military personnel do not appear to be detrimental to speech communication for listeners with normal hearing when the speech is at an average conversational level and the listener is actively attending to the signal.

AB  - Noise is one of the hazards faced by workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among industries in Negeri Sembilan with the objective to assess their compliance to Hearing Conservation Programme (HCP). The other objectives of this study were to determine the factors influencing it and to show the industries' compliance to each element of the programme. It was also to identify the association between compliance to HCP and the prevalence of hearing impairment and standard threshold shift. Data for this study were collected using questionnaires sent by mail and also the results of the latest audiometric tests. A total of 167 industries were analysed for this study. It was found that 41.3% of these industries fully complied to the programme. It was also found that the industries preferred to provide hearing protection device (92.8%) and least complied to noise control (61.1%). There were significant associations (p<0.05) between compliance and number of employees, status of ownership and the presence of officer in charge of hearing conservation programme. Having at least 150 employees actually raised the compliance to HCP in two folds (beta = 0.717, OR = 2.048, C.I 95% = 1.063 to 3.944). The prevalences of hearing impairment and standard threshold shift were 23.9% and 5.2% respectively. There was no significant association between the prevalence for hearing impairment and compliance to HCP. The prevalence for standard threshold shift was inversely related to compliance. This study showed that compliance percentage need to be improved as an effort to prevent the hearing problems among workers exposed to noise.

AB  - A population-based study to assess the use of hearing protection devices by older adults during noisy recreational activities was performed. The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. The use of hearing protection devices during noisy recreational activities was assessed by performing three examinations over a period of 10 years (1993-1995, no. of participants (n) = 3753, aged 48-92 years; 1998-2000, n = 2800, aged 53-97 years; 2003-2005, n = 2395, aged 58-100 years). The recreational activities included hunting, target shooting, woodworking/carpentry, metalworking, driving loud recreational vehicles, and performing yard work using either power tools or a chain saw. The prevalence of using hearing protection devices during any of these activities increased with time (9.5%, 15.0%, and 19.9% at baseline, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively). However, the use of hearing protection devices remained low for most activities. Those under the age of 65 were twice as likely to use hearing protection devices during noisy activities than were older adults. Men, those with a hearing handicap, and those with significant tinnitus were more likely to use hearing protection devices. Smokers and the less educated were less likely to use hearing protection devices. The results demonstrated that many adults expose themselves to potentially damaging recreational noise, leaving them at risk for hearing loss.

AB  - Background: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational diseases and the second most common cause of workers' claims for occupational injuries. Objective(s): Due to high prevalence of NIHL and several reports of improper use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), we conducted this study to compare the effect of face-to-face training in effective use of earplugs with appropriate NRR to overprotection of workers by using earplugs with higher than necessary noise reduction rating (NRR). Method(s): In a randomized clinical trial, 150 workers referred to occupational medicine clinic were randomly allocated to three arms-a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with no training in appropriate use of the device; a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with training; another group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 30, with no training. Hearing threshold was measured in the study groups by real ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) method. This trial is registered with Australian New Zealand clinical trials Registry, number ACTRN00363175. Result(s): The mean +/-SD age of the participants was 28+/-5 (range: 19-39) years. 42% of participants were female. The mean noise attenuation in the group with training was 13.88 dB, significantly higher than those observed in other groups. The highest attenuation was observed in high frequencies (4, 6, and 8 kHz) in the group with training. Conclusion(s): Training in appropriate use of earplugs significantly affects the efficacy of earplugs-even more than using an earplug with higher NRR.Copyright © 2014, Int J Occup Environ Med.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the noise distribution characteristics, workers' exposure to noise, and protective measures against noise on offshore oil platforms. Method(s): Six offshore oil platforms with a similar scale of production from China National Offshore Oil Corporation were selected from June to October, 2015 to conduct a field investigation of occupational health and detection of risk factors for occupational diseases and to know the current status of noise hazard on offshore oil platforms. Result(s): Among the 373 sites for noise measurement, 69.7% had a noise level of >=80 dB (A) ; among the 196 sites for noise measurement in the area with noisy equipment, 86.7% had a noise level of >=80 dB (A) ; among the 177 sites for noise measurement in the area without noisy equipment, 50.8% had a noise level of >=80 dB (A) . The actual sound attenuation of earplugs used on platforms was 18.6 dB (A) , and if they were worn correctly, they had a maximum value of noise protection of 103.6 dB (A) . The workers engaged in indoor operation were exposed to noise for 0.5~1.0 hour per day, and the 40 h/week equivalent sound level (weekly noise exposure, LEX, w) met the requirements in GBZ 2.2-2007 Occupational exposure limits for hazardous agents in the workplace Part 2: Physical agents[85 dB (A) ]. The workers engaged in outdoor operation were exposed to noise for 6.0~8.0 hours per day, and the over-standard rate of LEX, w was 53.7%. The noise exposure level showed a significant difference between the two groups, and indoor operation workers had a significantly lower noise exposure level than outdoor operation workers[ (69.8+/-3.4) dB (A) vs (85.5+/-3.5) dB (A) , P<0.05]. Conclusion(s): Noise sources on offshore oil platforms show the characteristic of centralized distribution, and noisy equipment have a great impact on the area without noisy equipment. The noise exposure level differs significantly between workers engaged in indoor and outdoor operation, and noise protection mainly relies on personal protective supplies.

AB  - Background: Three bioelectrical signals generated by brain activities (EEG), eye movements (EOG), and muscle contractions (EMG) are used for sleep studies. Traditionally, expensive Polysomnography (PSG) is used to acquire these signals by attaching uncomfortable wired sensors to patients' face and head with the risk of losing sensor contact. Hypothesis: The bioelectrical signals associated with EEG, EOG, and EMG can be recorded as a mixed biosignal inside the human ear using passive electrodes. Specifically, an earplug-based device can be safely plugged into the ear canal to collect the biosignal. A machine-learning separation algorithm can be then deployed to extract the three signals used for sleep staging. Method(s): We developed a wearable that can be placed safely inside human ears to capture EEG, EOG, and EMG. To adapt to complex ear structure and provide firm connection between electrodes and the skin, we selected an elastic material for its sensory base. To enhance the sensitivity to these low amplitude signals, the electrodes were designed from conductive cloth coated by thin pure silver leaf attached to the base and placed in both ears. Moreover, a signal separation model was developed, adopted from the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique to overcome the limited number of recording channels compared to the number of signals. A learning process was used to develop a template matrix for each signal compared to ground truth which improved signal recognition between people. Result(s): (Figure presented).Figure 1. A 30-minute hypnogram produced by a sleep staging system using in-ear EEG, EOG, and EMG (blue) is compared with the ground truth (pink) PSG. Misclassification is marked by red dashed rectangles. We prototyped our device and conducted 38-hour sleep experiments to evaluate its practicality and usability. Figure 1 demonstrates a promising result of a sleep staging model using EEG, EOG, and EMG provided by our in-ear wearable. Compared to PSG, our system achieved 94% accuracy in sleep stage classification on average when using the three separated signals as input. Conclusion(s): Preliminary results demonstrate that an unobtrusive wearable, which captures EEG, EOG, and EMG from inside the ears, shows the feasibility of collecting bioelectrical signals for sleep staging. We believe that our in-ear device has a potential to become a fundamental sensing solution applied in numerous other healthcare and human-computer interaction (HCI) applications.

AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy of a hearing conservation program in changing acoustic risk-taking and hearing conservation behaviors in elementary school children. Study Design: Prospective, randomized, mixed design controlled study. Method(s): Participants were grade-six students from 16 Vancouver School Board schools. Differences between the intervention and control group responses on a behavioral questionnaire were measured at baseline, and then at 2 weeks and 6 months after administration of a hearing conservation program (Sound SenseTM). Result(s): The intervention resulted in significant interactions for improved earplug use at dances (P =.019), rock concerts (P =.001), with percussion musical instruments (P =.002), and electric guitars (P =.028) at 2 weeks postintervention relative to baseline. Improvements in children's earplug use at dances (P =.041), rock concerts (P =.0024), and with power lawn mowers (P =.043) at 6 months postintervention relative to baseline were also observed. Behavior in the intervention group compared to control group improved in earplug use with any "other noises" at 2 weeks (P =.001), and 6 months (P =.022) relative to baseline. There was a tendency in the intervention group to reduce the duration of use of personal music devices at 2 weeks and 6 months after the hearing conservation program, which was nonsignificant. Conclusion(s): The Sound SenseTM hearing conservation program improved earplug use practices in elementary school children in the short and long term. The development, implementation and evaluation of a community-based health promotion project around hearing loss can serve as a tremendous opportunity for students to develop their knowledge and skills in health advocacy.

AB  - Objectives: The effectiveness of hearing protection devices (HPDs), when used in workplace conditions, has been shown over the years to be usually lower than the labeled values obtained under well-controlled laboratory conditions. Causes for such discrepancies have been listed and discussed by many authors. This study is an attempt to understand the issues in greater details and quantify some of these factors by looking at the performance of hearing protectors as a function of time during full work shift conditions. Method(s): A non-invasive field microphone in the real ear (F-MIRE)-based method has been developed for measuring the effectiveness of different HPDs as a function of time in the workplace. Details of the test procedures, the equipment used, and the post-processing operations are presented and discussed. The methodology was developed in such a way that a complete time and frequency representation are possible. The system was used on a total of 24 workers in eight different companies. Work shifts of up to 9-h long were recorded. Various types of earmuffs and one type of molded earplugs were tested. Result(s): Attenuation data reported as a function of time showed, for most workers tested, considerable fluctuations over entire work shift periods. Parts of these fluctuations are attributed to variations in the low-frequency content in the noise (in particular for earmuffs) as well as poor insertion and/or fitting of earplugs. Lower performances than laboratory-based ones were once again observed for most cases tested but also, important left and right ear differences were obtained for many individuals. When reported as a function of frequency, the attenuation results suggested that the few approximations used to relate the measurements to subjective real-ear-attenuation-at-threshold (REAT) data were realistic. Conclusion(s): The use of individualized attenuation data and performance ratings for HPDs as well as a good knowledge of the ambient noise in the workplace are key ingredients when evaluating the performance of hearing protectors in field conditions. © The Author 2011.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate noise exposures and the contributions of occupational and nonoccupational activities among three groups of Swedish workers (office workers, day care workers, and military flight technicians), and to evaluate risk factors for elevated hearing threshold levels. Forty-five subjects were recruited across the three groups. Each subject completed a risk factor questionnaire along with Bekesy audiometry at frequencies between 125 and 8000 Hz. Subjects also wore a noise dosimeter continuously for 1 week, and documented their occupational and nonoccupational activities using a time-activity log. Subjects in all groups completed >7400 h of dosimetry, and had weekly exposures between 76 and 81 dBA. Day care workers had the highest daily exposures, and flight technicians had the highest weekly exposures. Most daily and weekly exposures exceeded the 70 dBA exposure limit recommended for prevention of any hearing loss. Subjects' perceptions of their exposures generally agreed well with measured noise levels. Among office workers, exposures were predominately nonoccupational, while among flight technicians nonoccupational and occupational activities contributed roughly equally, and among day care workers occupational exposures were dominant. Extreme exposures and cumulative noise exposure were associated with an increased risk of hearing threshold levels >10 dB hearing level. Effective hearing loss prevention programs may be needed in occupations not historically considered to be at high risk of noise-induced hearing loss (e.g., day care workers). Prevention efforts need to address nonoccupational exposures as well as occupational exposures, as nonoccupational activities may present the dominant risk of noise-induced hearing loss for some workers.

AB  - The attenuation provided by a hearing protection device (HPD) in the field is usually estimated by applying a derating factor to the laboratory-determined noise reduction rating (NRR) of the HPD. However, attenuation is highly dependent on individual-specific HPD fit. Prediction of an individual's attenuation depends on the accuracy of the measurement system and the variability of attenuation over time (e.g. after HPD refitting). Variability in attenuation and attenuation test systems has not been adequately characterized to allow for such an assessment. This study compared attenuation measurements made with two systems, Real-Ear-at-Threshold (REAT) and Microphone-in-Real-Ear (MIRE), on 20 workers using two earplugs (foam and custom-molded). Workers' perceptions of the earplugs were also evaluated. Individuals' attenuation results were summarized as personal attenuation ratings (PARs, similar to NRRs). Variability in PARs from between-subject, within-subject and within-day (i.e. repeated tests on a subject without earplug refitting) differences was assessed and used to present the lower confidence limit, or uncertainty factor (UF), of an average individual's attenuation. The custom-molded earplug PARs achieved a higher mean percentage of labeled attenuation than did the foam earplug with both test systems. The custom-molded earplugs also had higher overall acceptance among workers. MIRE PAR levels were lower than REAT levels for both earplugs, but the relationship between the two test systems was highly variable. The MIRE system had lower within-day variability than the REAT system. One individual's MIRE results were highly influential; removal of these results greatly reduced the UF for the custom-molded earplug/MIRE combination. UFs ranged from 8.8 to 13.5 dB. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating variability in individual-specific protection results for personal protective equipment like HPDs, rather than relying on single measurements. © The Author 2006.

AB  - Objectives. We measured noise levels associated with various forms of mass transit and compared them to exposure guidelines designed to protect against noise-induced hearing loss. Methods. We used noise dosimetry to measure time-integrated noise levels in a representative sample of New York City mass transit systems (subways, buses, ferries, tramway, and commuter railways) aboard transit vehicles and at vehicle boarding platforms or terminals during June and July 2007. Results. Of the transit types evaluated, subway cars and platforms had the highest associated equivalent continuous average (Leq) and maximum noise levels. All transit types had Leq levels appreciably above 70 A-weighted decibels, the threshold at which noise-induced hearing loss is considered possible. Conclusions. Mass transit noise exposure has the potential to exceed limits recommended by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency and thus cause noise-induced hearing loss among riders of all forms of mass transit given sufficient exposure durations. Environmental noise-control efforts in mass transit and, in cases in which controls are infeasible, the use of personal hearing protection would benefit the ridership's hearing health.

AB  - Introduction: High noise levels disrupt quality and reduce quantity of sleep. Excessive noise may thereby increase the risk of delirium, resulting in increased Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) length of stay and possibly increased mortality. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was conducted in a 24 bed tertiary care academic MICU where Physicians, Nurses, and other allied health care providers were involved. A pre-post intervention design methodology was used for this study. MICU staff responded to an online survey assessing baseline perceptions about patients' sleep quality and quantity. Data was also gathered on providers' perception of noise levels in the MICU and factors contributing to high noise levels. In addition, baseline measurements of noise levels (in decibels (dBA) were obtained using a dosimeter. Decibel levels for different noise sources such as ventilator alarms, infusion pumps, telephones, pagers and staff conversations were measured. Multipronged interventions involving environmental changes (reducing alarm sound levels, reducing telephone ringer levels etc.), provider education and patient level interventions (use of sleep enhancement order sets, closing room doors at night time to reduce noise exposure) were implemented. A repeat survey was performed post-intervention to re-assess provider perceptions regarding patients' sleep and noise levels in the MICU. Also, noise levels were re-measured with the dosimeter. Result(s): Baseline survey data revealed that 88% of the MICU staff agreed that patients slept poorly in the MICU, 69% felt that on an average our patients slept for less than 4 h per day, and more than half (52%) of the interruptions to sleep were secondary to high noise levels. Noise level measurements revealed that alarms (64 dBA), pagers (64 dBA) and staff conversations (60 dBA) were the most significant contributors to noise. Post-intervention, we noted an increase in the proportion of respondents (26% vs 35% p = 0.07) who felt that our patients slept more than 5 h per day. Also, post- intervention, staff continued to perceive that greater than 50% of the interruptions to sleep were secondary to noise. Although mean noise levels were not significantly different pre and post intervention (54.2 dBA vs 53.8 dBA), there was a significant reduction in the number of episodes of peak noise level elevations above 60 dBA (1735 vs 1289, p = <0.00). Conclusion(s): High noise level in the MICU is a contributing factor to patient's sleep fragmentation and deprivation in the ICU. Reducing mean and peak noise levels in an ICU proved difficult, and gains may be difficult to sustain over time. In addition to noise reduction, efforts to modify the patient experience of noise, such as provision of hearing protection or white noise, may be more fruitful in reducing influence on sleep.

AB  - This project was a cross-sectional survey of the working environment and health outcomes of 102 Thai stone sculptors in northeast Thailand. In addition, postural analysis was conducted on 25 stone sculptors using the REBA method. Most stone sculptors were male (90%), had worked an average of 9.6 years, worked 6 days/week, an average of 6.9 hours. About 67% reported being exposed to high levels of noise and 10% reported reduced hearing. Postural analysis by REBA found that 80% were in a MSD high risk category. Reports of musculoskeletal disorders in the past 3 months were common with symptoms reported by 28% for the lower back and 17% for the upper back. Moreover, 12% of the stone sculptors reported an abnormal chest x-ray, 5% had silicosis and over 29% reported cough or cough with phlegm. The stone sculptors also reported that in the past 3 months 64% had an accident with the tools used on the job (power drills, grinders, saws and hand tools), 20% reported sharp injuries and 7% electric shocks. Although most workers (93%) knew that silica dust could cause silicosis, use of controls was limited. Although 87% reported wearing a mask regularly, only 60% reported having an N95 respirator. Only 46% reported wearing eye protection regularly, only 27% reported using hearing protection regularly and only 17% used safety shoes. Therefore, an important initial step is further education and provision of adequate PPE at lower prices. In addition, introduction of engineering controls would help eliminate silica, ergonomic and safety hazards at the source.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is concern that sound via earphones and headphones attached to headsets used in workplaces may be a risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although there are some previous studies investigating exposure to noise from headphones, almost none have assessed the risks to workers who use earphones. We assessed exposure to noise among workers who regularly wear earphones in noisy workplaces., METHODS: The subjects of this study were 21 workers who regularly wear earphones in three manufacturing companies in Japan. The sound pressure output from earphones and personal exposure to occupational noise was measured for each worker. A noise-dosimeter was used to measure individual exposure to occupational noise. The sound pressure output from the earphones was measured by recording the electric signal with a data recorder attached to the earphones, and the recording was analyzed by playing it back in the laboratory through a sound analyzer via an ear simulator., RESULTS: The mean scores for personal exposure and earphone output LAeq were 87.9 dB and 87.6 dB, respectively. Earphone output LAeq exceeded 85 dB for two-thirds of the subjects. Nearly all the subjects lacked hearing protection devices (HPDs) on their earphones., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that workers who use earphones in noisy workplaces are exposed to the following NIHL risk factors: (1) they are deprived of the opportunity to fit appropriate HPDs, and (2) the sound pressure output from the earphones themselves exceeds the occupational exposure limit.

AB  - Objectives: It is important that the patients sleep sufficiently for physical and mental recovery after surgery. In our previous study, we showed that the ICU noise increased the sleep latency and modified the sleep structures for even healthy young subjects. We investigate in this study the attenuation of this ICU noise's effect by earplugs and consequently the improvement of subjective/objective sleep qualities. Method(s): Six healthy male subjects (21.7 +/- 1.1 years old) were polygraphically recorded (EEG, EOG and ECG with R&K's criteria) during their nap (30mn) for 1 adaptation day (AD), 2 baseline days (BL-1 and BL-2) and experimental day (EX). The order of BL-2 and EX is counterbalanced. For BL-1, BL-2 and EX, the Ss were exposed in the reproduced ICU noise (48.9 +/- 2.1 dB) recorded from a real ICU. In EX, they were required to use earplugs (NRR=29 dB) in order to attenuate the ICU noise. They were asked before and after their nap for each day to give a sample of saliva for measuring of amylase (stress marker) and to fill in POMS that explores subjective mood states. Result(s): We observed a significant difference (P < 0.05) between BL (15.6 +/- 5.9mn, the average BL-1 and BL-2) and EX (9.6 +/- 3.54mn) for the sleep latency based on the first spindle appearance. However the other sleep characteristics, amylase content and POMS showed no significant modification. Conclusion(s): It is obvious that earplugs are useful for ICU's noise reduction and facilitate the sleep onset. The earplugs will be considered as low-cost, easy-to-use tools for the ICU patient's comfort.

AB  - Background: Noise exposure is an inherent part of duty of the aircrew and maintenance staff in the Indian Air Force (IAF). An audiometric survey of IAF personnel was carried out to analyze the prevalence and severity of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). Method(s): An audiometric study of 1000 IAF personnel of various trades, age and exposure groups were carried out at an operational base. Age related correction of 5 dB per decade was applied for personnel above 50 years of age. Personal factors like smoking, blood group and use of ear defenders were analysed for their effect on the prevalence of NIHL. Result(s): The study revealed an overall incidence of NIHL of 22.9 % in the personnel with a higher prevalence among the technical trades (26.18 %) as compared to non technical trades (12.5 %). There was a significant increase in prevalence of hearing loss with duration of exposure with 50.8% of personnel above 30 years of exposure having hearing loss. A higher incidence of hearing loss was observed in personnel of blood group O and smokers whereas use of ear defenders was protective. Conclusion(s): The study reveals a significantly increased prevalence of NIHL among the technical trades of the IAF personnel. The deleterious effects of smoking and protective effect of regular use of ear defenders are emphasized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tanzania has a young mining history with several operating open pit and underground mines. No prevalence studies of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been conducted among mine workers to provide an impetus for the development of comprehensive hearing protection programmes., AIMS: To determine the prevalence of NIHL and associated factors among miners in a major gold mining company operating in Tanzania. Associated risk factors such as age, sex and duration of exposure were examined., METHODS: Audiograms obtained from periodic medical examinations were categorized using the UK Health & Safety Executive system., RESULTS: A total of 246 audiograms were studied. The prevalence of NIHL was 47%, with 12% with poor hearing and 35% with mild hearing impairment. The proportion of NIHL increased with total years of exposure to noise. Underground miners were more affected (71%) than open pit miners (28%). These findings were statistically significant. The highest proportion of miners with NIHL (60%) was among the youngest age group (20-29 years)., CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of NIHL in the company under study. There was a strong correlation with type of mining, age and years of exposure. The findings have been used to develop comprehensive hearing conservation programmes.Copyright © The Author 2015.

AB  - The mandate of ASA Working Group S12/WG11 has been to develop "laboratory and/or field procedure(s) that yield useful estimates of field performance" of hearing protection devices (HPDs). A real-ear attenuation at threshold procedure was selected, devised, tested for one earmuff and three earplugs via an interlaboratory study involving five laboratories and 147 subjects, and incorporated into a new standard that was approved in 1997 [Royster et al., "Development of a new standard laboratory protocol for estimating the field attenuation of hearing protection devices. Part I. Research of Working Group 11, Accredited Standards Committee S 12, Noise," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 99, 1506-1526; ANSI, S12.6-1997, "American National Standard method for measuring real-ear attenuation of hearing protectors" (American National Standards Institute, New York, 1997)]. The subject-fit methodology of ANSI S12.6-1997 relies upon listeners who are audiometrically proficient, but inexperienced in the use of HPDs. Whenever a new method is adopted, it is important to know the effects of variability on the power of the measurements. In evaluation of protector noise reduction determined by experimenter-fit, informed-user-fit, and subject-fit methods, interlaboratory reproducibility was found to be best for the subject-fit method. Formulas were derived for determining the minimum detectable difference between attenuation measurements and for determining the number of subjects necessary to achieve a selected level of precision. For a precision of 6 dB, the study found that the minimum number of subjects was 4 for the Bilsom UF-1 earmuff, 10 for the E.A.R Classic earplug, 31 for the Willson EP100 earplug, and 22 for the PlasMed V-51R earplug.

AB  - The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Environmental Protection Agency sponsored the completion of an interlaboratory study to compare two fitting protocols specified by ANSI S12.6-1997 (R2002) [(2002). American National Standard Methods for the Measuring Real-Ear Attenuation of Hearing Protectors, American National Standards Institute, New York]. Six hearing protection devices (two earmuffs, foam, premolded, custom-molded earplugs, and canal-caps) were tested in six laboratories using the experimenter-supervised, Method A, and (nave) subject-fit, Method B, protocols with 24 subjects per laboratory. Within-subject, between-subject, and between-laboratory standard deviations were determined for individual frequencies and A -weighted attenuations. The differences for the within-subject standard deviations were not statistically significant between Methods A and B. Using between-subject standard deviations from Method A, 3-12 subjects would be required to identify 6-dB differences between attenuation distributions. Whereas using between-subject standard deviations from Method B, 5-19 subjects would be required to identify 6-dB differences in attenuation distributions of a product tested within the same laboratory. However, the between-laboratory standard deviations for Method B were -0.1 to 3.0 dB less than the Method A results. These differences resulted in considerably more subjects being required to identify statistically significant differences between laboratories for Method A (12-132 subjects) than for Method B (9-28 subjects). © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Introduction: Sensorineural hearing loss affects a high percentage of the population. Ototoxicity is a serious and pervasive problem in patients treated with cisplatin. Strategies to ameliorate ototoxicity without compromising on antitumor activity of treatments are urgently needed. Similar problems occur with aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy for infections. Noise-induced hearing loss affects a large number of people. The use of ear protection is not always possible or effective. The prevention of hearing loss with drug therapy would have a huge impact in reducing the number of people with hearing loss from these major causes. Areas covered: This review discusses significant research findings dealing with the use of protective agents against hearing loss caused by cisplatin, aminoglycoside antibiotics and noise trauma. The efficacy in animal studies and the application of these protective agents in clinical trials that are ongoing are presented. Expert opinion: The reader will gain new insights into current and projected future strategies to prevent sensorineural hearing loss from cisplatin chemotherapy, aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy and noise exposure. The future appears to offer numerous agents to prevent hearing loss caused by cisplatin, aminoglycoside antibiotics and noise. Novel delivery systems will provide ways to guide these protective agents to the desired target areas in the inner ear and circumvent problems with therapeutic interference of antitumor and antibiotics agents as well as minimize undesired side effects. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - The influence of military service on self-assessed hearing symptoms and measured auditory function was studied as well as the efficacy of the Hearing Conservation Program (HCP) of the Swedish Armed Forces. 839 conscripts were recruited for the study at reporting to military service. They were all exposed to noise over the risk-limits from weapons and vehicles and used earmuffs and/or earplugs. Questionnaires and pure tone screening audiometry were studied at the start and the end of the military service. Retrospective information regarding audiometry at conscription before military service was included as control. The prevalence values of tinnitus were 23% before and 32% after the service and of sensitivity to noise 16% and 19% respectively. The prevalence values of hearing impairment were 6.3% at conscription, 14.5% at reporting to military service, and 24% after the training period. The incidence values of hearing decline were 3.7% during the period with no military noise exposure and 6.6% during the military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of worsened tinnitus and sensitivity to noise four times and for a high frequency hearing decline six times. We observed elevated prevalence values of tinnitus, sensitivity to noise and hearing impairment at discharge compared to before military service. We observed an elevated risk of hearing decline during military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of tinnitus, noise sensitivity and hearing decline. We suggest improvements regarding inclusion criteria for military service, and for education regarding the HCP.

AB  - Civilian law:from occupational medicine to occupational event. Despite the growing importance of objective measurements, the health effects of many occupational risk factors are currently not fully quantified. Occupational noise, as a widespread risk factor, is illustrative in this regard; there is a strong body of evidence linking it to an important health outcome (hearing loss), but it is less decisively associated with others (such as psychological disorders). It is also distinct from environmental noise, and therefore falls under the responsibility of employers as well as individuals. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is, at present, incurable and irreversible. However, it is preventable, if effective and global hearing conservation programmes can be implemented. These programmes should not be isolated efforts, but should be integrated into the overall hazard prevention and control programme of the workplace. Belgian law encompasses a set of provisions for prevention and the protection of the health and safety of workers within the workplace, including aspects pertaining to the hygiene of the workplace and psychosocial aspects at work (stress, violence, bullying and sexual harassment, among others). In principle, combating environmental noise is fully addressed in this country. However, other levels of policy-making also play an important role in this regard. For example, the federal government is in charge of product standards, and therefore also of noise emission standards for products. The interpretation and enforcement of Belgian legislation on well-being at work converts European directives and international agreements on well-being at work into Belgian law.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Objective: Occupationally acquired noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most prevalent occupational disease in Austria and among the most common in many other countries. Because of the wide variation in hearing loss after equivalent exposures it has long been assumed that some individuals are more vulnerable to occupational NIHL than others. Earlier attempts to define predictors of NIHL before starting occupational noise exposure have largely failed. We present results of a prospective study evaluating the potential of temporary threshold shift (TTS) after a test exposure to predict NIHL. Method(s): Between 1982 and 1989, overall 311 apprentices were included into a prospective study during their initial health screening visit. At this occasion, a standardised noise exposure was applied (20 min, 200-500 Hz, 100 dBA) and the TTS at 4 kHz was determined during at least 10 min after exposure. Hearing loss was monitored at follow-up visits every 3-5 years. Follow-up was 13 years on average. Result(s): Permanent threshold shift was predicted by duration of noise exposure, frequency of wearing noise protectors and especially by the initial TTS at 4 kHz. Using 14 dB TTS as a cut-off had 82% sensitivity and 53% specificity to predict 20 dB or higher levels of NIHL. Conclusion(s): The TTS model can be successfully applied as a method to detect individuals at greater risk of occupational NIHL. It is recommended to routinely include such a procedure into initial workers' examinations for suitability to work under occupational noise conditions and for counselling on the use of hearing protectors.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the proportion of UK surfers aware of external auditory canal exostosis, to identify surfer characteristics associated with knowledge of the condition and to explore attitudes to earplug use. Method(s): An online, cross-sectional survey of UK-based surfers. Result(s): Of 375 surfers, 86.1 per cent (n = 323; 95 per cent confidence interval = 82.3-89.3) reported awareness of external auditory canal exostosis. Further investigation revealed that, despite their awareness of the condition, 23.4 per cent of these surfers (88 out of 323; 95 per cent confidence interval = 19.5-28.0) had little or no knowledge about external auditory canal exostosis. Predictors of knowledge included: distance from nearest surfing beach (p = 0.001), surfing standard (ability) (p = 0.008), earplug use (p = 0.024) and positive external auditory canal exostosis diagnosis (p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that a significant minority of UK surfers have no knowledge about this condition. Knowledge of external auditory canal exostosis was significantly associated with earplug use when surfing. Efforts to improve surfers' knowledge are required to enable surfers to better protect themselves, which could reduce the incidence of external auditory canal exostosis.Copyright © JLO (1984) Limited 2016.

AB  - The beliefs and attitudes regarding the risk of hearing loss and their impact on hearing protector use were investigated among Swedish workers. A questionnaire, developed by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), was used. The study objective was to assess workers' attitudes towards using hearing protection devices (HPDs) and to enhance the ability of workers to protect themselves from occupational hearing loss. Ninety-five per cent of the respondents were aware that loud noise could damage their hearing, 90% considered that a hearing loss would be a serious problem, and 85% believed that HPDs could protect their hearing. However, lower percentages of workers always used the HPDs when they were noise-exposed. Fifty-five per cent of the workers indicated that they could not hear warning signals when using HPDs, and 45% of the workers indicated that they considered HPDs to be uncomfortable. These issues must be addressed to make HPD use more effective.

AB  - One of the major occupational hazards of working in military service is being subjected to intense impulse noise. We analyzed the clinical presentation of acoustic traumas, induced by mass rifle gunshot noise during military training, in unprotected patients. We evaluated 189 soldiers who had otologic symptoms after rifle shooting exercises without using any hearing protection. All soldiers had been training on the K2 rifle. We took medical histories; conducted physical examinations and hearing evaluations (pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and impedence audiometry); and distributed the Newmann's Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) survey. In addition, we evaluated a normal control group of 64 subjects of similar age who had never fired a rifle. In the patient group, the most common and irritating reported symptom was tinnitus (94.2%), and the average THI score in the patient group was 39.51 +/- 14.87, which was significantly higher than the control group score (0.56 +/- 3.94) (p < 0.001). Average outcomes of post-exposure air conduction thresholds were 21.33 +/- 13.25 dB HL in the affected ears. These levels also were significantly higher than those of the control group (9.16 +/- 4.07dB HL) (p < 0.001). Hearing loss was most prominent at high frequencies. An asymmetry of hearing loss related to head position during shooting was not observed. Acoustic trauma induced by gunshot noise can cause permanent tinnitus and hearing loss. Hearing protection (bilateral earplugs) and environmental reform are necessary. Copyright © 2011 JOEH, LLC.

AB  - Background and purpose: The last way of noise control is using hearing protective devices that maybe the first way of noise control in some industries. Obviously if the hearing protection device is not used continuously and properly, its actual performance is reduced. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between demographic variables and BASNEF training constructs in promoting hearing protection device use for longer durations. Material(s) and Method(s): A case-control study was carried out in which 50 individuals participated in each group. A questionnaire was developed based on BASNEF training contracts and participants completed the questionnaire before and three months after the intervention. The intervention was performed according to BASNEF training model in experimental group using both theoretical and practical methods, while the control group received no trainings. Result(s): Before the intervention, significant correlations were observed between the awareness construct and age, attitude, influencing people and educational level, and also between enabling factors and marital status (P<0.05). After the intervention, there were significant correlations between influencing people, performance constructs and educational level (P<0.05). But there was no significant correlation between the constructs of BASNEF training model and job experience (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Based on our findings, there was a strong correlation between influencing people construct and educational level, therefore, they require further attention when planning for training programs in promoting the use of hearing protection devices for longer durations.Copyright © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Women with children that live in the countryside were surveyed (n=24). Structured questionnaire., STATISTICAL ANALYSES: chi2, Student's t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and logistic regression., RESULTS: Many women had suffered an accident in the countryside (65.6 %). Farm worker usually did not use personal protective equipment (PPE). Hearing protection, gloves, and safety goggles were rarely used. Working women showed a high risk perception for urban driving, the handling of agrochemicals, and driving on main roads (85.7 %, 70 % and 66.7 %). There was no significant association between risk perception and PPE use. Most mothers (87.5 %) thought that was good for children to learn how to perform farm chores starting at a young age. Children started to drive tractors at 9 years of age; 12.23 years on average. More than 7 % of the children (7.14 %) have suffered an accident on the farm. The most frequent accidents were being trapped in machinery (60 %). No association was found between the independent variables and the dependent variable; farm-related accidents in children (p>0.2)., CONCLUSIONS: Risk communication is necessary to inform people involved and to reduce exposure.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Exposure of workers to mixtures of organic solvents and to occupational noise is frequent in a number of industries. Recent studies suggest that exposure to both can cause a more severe hearing loss than exposure to noise alone. Our cross-sectional study included 411 workers of a large automobile plant divided in three groups. The first group included assembly workers exposed to noise alone; the second included workers in a new paint shop, who were exposed to a mixture of organic solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included paint shop workers exposed to both noise and higher than permissible levels of organic solvents in an old paint shop. These groups were compared in terms of low-frequency hearing loss (model 1; average hearing threshold >25 dB at 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz) and high-frequency hearing loss (model 2; average hearing threshold >25 dB at 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 6 kHz, and 8 kHz). High-frequency hearing loss was more common in workers exposed to a combination of noise and mixed organic solvents even at permissible levels than in workers exposed to noise alone even after correction for confounding variables. This study shows that combined exposure to mixed organic solvents and occupational noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Therefore, an appropriate hearing protection programme is recommended, that would include short-interval audiometric examinations and efficient hearing protectors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the masking effect of magnetic resonance (MR)-related acoustic noise and the effect of passive hearing protection on speech understanding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acoustic recordings were made at 1.5 T at patient and operator (interventionalist in the MR suite) locations for relevant pulse sequences. In an audiologic laboratory, speech-to-noise ratios (STNRs) were determined, defined as the difference between the absolute sound pressure levels of MR noise and speech. The recorded noise of the MR sequences was played simultaneously with the recorded sentences at various intensities, and 15 healthy volunteers (seven women, eight men; median age, 27 years) repeated these sentences as accurately as possible. The STNR that corresponded with a 50% correct repetition was used as the measure for speech intelligibility. In addition, the effect of passive hearing protection on speech intelligibility was tested by using an earplug model. RESULT(S): Overall, speech understanding was reduced more at operator than at patient location. Most problematic were fast gradient-recalled-echo train and spiral k-space sequences. As the absolute sound pressure level of these sequences was approximately 100 dB at patient location, the vocal effort needed to attain 50% intelligibility was shouting (>77 dB). At operator location, less effort was required because of the lower sound pressure levels of the MR noise. Fast spoiled gradient-recalled-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences showed relatively favorable results with raised voice at operator location and loud speaking at patient location. The use of hearing protection slightly improved STNR. CONCLUSION(S): At 1.5 T, the level of MR noise requires that large vocal effort is used, at the operator and especially at the patient location. Depending on the specific MR sequence used, loud speaking or shouting is needed to achieve adequate bidirectional communication with the patient. The wearing of earplugs improves speech intelligibility. © RSNA, 2004.

AB  - Determining the effectiveness of impulse noise attenuation with hearing protection devices (HPDs) is an important part of their selection. Measuring impulse noise parameters under an HPD would involve exposing subjects to impulses with a high peak sound pressure level. This paper presents a computational method of determining impulse noise parameters under the cups of earmuffs. Calculations are done using the transfer function of earmuffs, determined with Shaw's electrical equivalent of an HPD, taking into account the design parameters of earmuffs. The developed method was used for calculations in the presence of impulse noise generated by gunshots. To verify the computational method, the results of these calculations were compared with the results of measurements.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sound in the study areas was of sufficient intensity to cause hearing loss and if so whether those exposed have been affected and to determine whether workers/employees in the study areas were aware that sound can cause hearing loss and if so whether they knew that this can be prevented by ear protection. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Industrial area A and B randomly selected from among industries in Dar es Salaam. SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty workers from area A and fifty two employees from area B. RESULT(S): In both study areas the noise levels were above the safe limit of 85dB(A). In area A 28 workers and in area B eight employees had noise induced hearing loss. In area A 81.1% of the workers and in area B 85% of the employees knew that noise causes hearing loss. All workers/employees from both study areas knew that noise induced hearing loss could be prevented by some form of ear protection. CONCLUSION(S): Workers/Employees exposed to noise above 85dB(A) will eventually develop hearing loss. Workers/employees are aware of this hazard. There is therefore a need to educate those exposed on how best to protect their ears from the hazard and provide them with protective gear.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of short-term impulse noise on the size and dynamics of temporary threshold shift, which precedes permanent threshold shift, i.e. noise-induced hearing loss. It was hoped to use the findings for preventive activities. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 80 healthy subjects (160 ears), aged 19-23 years, divided into two groups: group I comprised 40 recruit soldiers put to the shooting training, and group II consisted of 40 young male controls. All subjects had to show normal hearing with pure tone audiometric thresholds between 10-15 dB. Transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TOAE) measurements were performed by ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3-5 min before shooting and then 2 min, 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively after shooting. In group II the time intervals were similar. Result(s): It was found that the gunshot impulse noise from the kbk AKMS rifle caused temporary hearing threshold shift (TTS) at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kHz frequencies of 1.07, 0.96, 1.41, 0.88 and 1.25 dB SPL, respectively. TTS turned out to be maximum at 4 and 5 kHz and minimum at 1 and 2 kHz. Conclusion(s): Short-term impulse noise generated by the rifle gunshots induces rather small temporary threshold shift of hearing. Anyhow, considering possibilities of different weapon noises in the military environment as well as various sources of industrial impulse noise, the usage of hearing protectors should be highly recommended.

AB  - Quality sleep is a problem for the critically ill who are cared for in an environment where interventions night and day are common, staff members are constantly present in relatively high numbers, and treatment is accompanied by a range of changing warning tones and alarms and lights. These critical care units are generally designed without a focus on patient comfort, sleep, and rest and often lack access to appropriate natural daylight. To add to this problem, critical illness, particularly sepsis, disrupts circadian rhythms and sleep patterns, and disruption of circadian rhythms, in turn, impairs immunity and contributes to delirium. In a randomized controlled trial in the previous issue of Critical Care, Van Rompaey and colleagues have intervened to reduce noise, which is a key factor in this disruption, by having patients use earplugs at night. Delirium was assessed by using the NEECHAM (Neelon and Champagne) confusion scale, and sleep perception was assessed by patients' responses to a set of five questions. After the first night, patients reported a better sleep perception and the occurrence of delirium was reduced (hazard ratio of 0.47 for the development of delirium) or was delayed. The study did not quantify adequacy of pain control in post-surgical patients and used patient reporting to assess sleep. Whether patients were receiving respiratory or other organ support was not reported. The potential benefit of earplugs is an important practical finding that could be implemented in most intensive care units. © 2012 BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This study was done to identify the distribution and related factors for stage of change for wearing hearing protection devices (HPDs) by workers in environments with high noise. Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model and Trans-theoretical Model were tested. Method(s): The participants were 755 workers from 20 noisy work places in Busan and Gyeongnam. Data were collected from January to April 2008 using self-administered questionnaires, and analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Result(s): There were significant differences in social mode (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.73) between precontemplation/contemplation and preparation stage, in males (OR=2.36, 95% CI: 1.24-4.51), workers with high school education or less (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.28-2.78), shift workers (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.02-2.21), workers who previously worked in noisy places (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.20-2.34), and workers who had previous hearing examinations (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.25-2.85), in the social model (OR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.42-1.78), and self-efficacy (OR= 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08) between workers in preparation and action stages, in length of time working in noisy work places (OR=2.26, 95% CI: 1.17-4.39), social model (OR=1.66, 95% CI: 1.33-2.08), and perceived benefit (OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.97) between action and maintenance stage. Conclusion(s): Social model was a common factor showing differences between two adjacent stages for wearing HPDs. The results provide data for developing programs to encourage workers to wear HPDs and application of these programs in work settings.

AB  - There are barriers to effective hearing protection among musicians. Aim(s): To investigate the acceptance of hearing protection aids in members of an instrumental and voice music band. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective study of 34 members of the Municipal Indaial Band. Sound pressure levels were measured during a rehearsal, indicating mean levels ranging from 96.4 dB(A) to 106.9 dB(A). Subjects answered questionnaires and underwent audiometry. They attended a lecture in which folders and hearing protection aids were provided; subjects were asked to try using the protectors for 3 months. Result(s): At the end of the study period, 56.2% reported not liking hearing protection, while 43.7% accepted such protection. The most common complaints were discomfort with sounds (58.8%) and tinnitus (47%). 77.1% said that music might cause hearing impairment. A statistically significant difference was observed in the right ear at 4 and 6 kHz and at the left ear in 3, 4 and 6 kHz when median thresholds were compared with those from unexposed controls. Conclusion(s): Although most subjects seemed aware of the risk, few took preventive measures against hearing loss. This suggests the need for periodic educational campaigns and specific legislation tailored to music professionals. © Revista Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia. All Rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data are associated with the use of hearing protection devices at work, according to gender., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006, using a random sample of 2,429 workers, aged between 18 and 65 years old, from residential sub-areas in Salvador, BA, Northeastern Brazil. Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data. Workers who reported that they worked in places where they needed to shout in order to be heard were considered to be exposed to noise. Exposed workers were asked whether they used hearing protection devices, and if so, how frequently. Analyses were conducted according to gender, with estimates made about prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices, prevalence ratios, and their respective 95% confidence intervals., RESULTS: Twelve percent (12.3%) of study subjects reported that they were exposed to noise while working. Prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices was 59.3% for men and 21.4% for women. Men from higher socioeconomic levels (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.14;1.90) and who had previous audiometric tests (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.15;1.88) were more likely to use hearing protection devices. For women, greater perceived safety was associated with the use of protection devices (PR = 2.92; 95%CI 1.34;6.34). This perception was specifically related to the presence of supervisors committed to safety (PR = 2.09; 95%CI 1.04;4.21), the existence of clear rules to prevent workplace injuries (PR = 2.81; 95%CI 1.41;5.59), and whether they were informed about workplace safety (PR = 2.42; 95%CI 1.23;4.76)., CONCLUSIONS: There is a gender bias regarding the use of hearing protection devices that is less favorable to women. The use of such devices among women is positively influenced by their perception of a safe workplace, suggesting that gender should be considered as a factor in hearing conservation programs.

AB  - Objectives To identify factors associated with hearing protection device use (HPD) at work. Methods This is a cross-sectional study carried out with a random cluster area sample of households from the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational and health related data. Noise exposed worker were those who reported having to shout to be heard in the workplace. When exposed, they were asked whether they use HPD, and how often was it. Results There were 2429 workers from 18 to 65 years of age, and 299 (12.3%) reported being exposed to loud noise at work. The prevalence of HPD use was 44.5%, 59.3% and 21.4% for men and women, respectively. Among men, only high socioeconomic status (prevalence ratio, PR=1.47; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.14, 1.90) and previous audiometry (PR=1.47; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.88) were associated with HPD use. In contrast, among women the perception of a good safety climate was associated with HPD use (PR=2.92; 95% CI: 1.34, 6.34), particularly the reporting of having supervisors committed with safety (PR=2.09; 95% CI: 1.04, 4.21), clear rules to prevent work-related injuries (PR=2.81; 95% CI: 1.41, 5.59) and when they were informed about work safety guidelines (PR=2.42; 95% CI: 1.23, 4.76). Conclusions Our results show that there is a gender bias regarding HPD use less favourable to women compared with men; women's HPD use is more likely to be positively influenced by safety climate suggesting that gender needs to be taken into account in hearing protection programs.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the mixed exposure of highway maintenance workers to airborne particles, noise, and gaseous co-pollutants. The aim was to provide a better understanding of the workers' exposure to facilitate the evaluation of short-term effects on cardiovascular health endpoints. To quantify the workers' exposure, we monitored 18 subjects during 50 non-consecutive work shifts. Exposure assessment was based on personal and work site measurements and included fine particulate matter (PM2.5), particle number concentration (PNC), noise (Leq), and the gaseous co-pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Mean work shift PM2.5 concentrations (gravimetric measurements) ranged from 20.3 to 321 mug m -3 (mean 62 mug m-3) and PNC were between 1.6x104 and 4.1x105 particles cm-3 (8.9x104 particles cm-3). Noise levels were generally high with Leq over work shifts from 73.3 to 96.0 dB(A); the averaged Leq over all work shifts was 87.2 dB(A). The highest exposure to fine and ultrafine particles was measured during grass mowing and lumbering when motorized brush cutters and chain saws were used. Highest noise levels, caused by pneumatic hammers, were measured during paving and guardrail repair. We found moderate Spearman correlations between PNC and PM2.5 (r = 0.56); PNC, PM2.5, and CO (r = 0.60 and r = 0.50) as well as PNC and noise (r = 0.50). Variability and correlation of parameters were influenced by work activities that included equipment causing combined air pollutant and noise emissions (e.g. brush cutters and chain saws). We conclude that highway maintenance workers are frequently exposed to elevated airborne particle and noise levels compared with the average population. This elevated exposure is a consequence of the permanent proximity to highway traffic with additional peak exposures caused by emissions of the work-related equipment. © The Author 2013.

AB  - CONTEXT: Despite existing preventive measures, the number of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) cases reported to the French Military Epidemiological Surveillance System (MESS) remains high., AIMS: The objective of this study was to describe AAT and the preventive measures already implemented., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional analysis of AAT using data from the MESS for the period 2007-2014. In addition, we reviewed the current prevention measures that exist in the French armed forces., STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Comparisons between different incidence rates were made by Poisson and quasi-Poisson regression., RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2014, 10,487 AAT cases were reported to the MESS, with a significant decrease in 2013 (P < 0.001). AAT incidence rates were the highest among those aged <25 years - 14.3 per 1000 person-years (PYs) (P < 0.001), and those in the army; with 8.1 per 1000 PYs (P < 0.001), and men had almost twice the risk of women (P < 0.001). AAT mainly occurred in training schools or at camps during exercises. The main prevention actions identified were the following: official regulations, education, making hearing protection devices (HPDs) available for all service members, and regular hearing monitoring. A working group has been set up and has proposed an informative chapter in the weapon handling instruction book, an AAT simulator, and a new HPD, the 3M earplug, with an information brochure., CONCLUSIONS: AAT rates decreased from 2007 to 2014 in the French armed forces. Further analysis is needed to identify the underlying factors involved to improve the prevention actions proposed. The MESS and targeted surveys will assess the impact of the different prevention measures implemented.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to describe workplace noise exposures, risk factors for hearing loss, and hearing levels among sand and gravel miners, and to determine whether full shift noise exposures resulted in changes in hearing thresholds from baseline values. Sand and gravel miners (n = 317) were interviewed regarding medical history, leisure-time and occupational noise exposure, other occupational exposures, and use of hearing protection. Audiometric tests were performed both before the work shift (following a 12-hour noise-free interval) and immediately following the work shift. Full shift noise dosimetry was conducted. Miners' noise exposures exceeded the Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for 69% of workers, and exceeded the Mine Safety and Health Administration's action level for enrollment in a hearing conservation program for 41% of workers. Significantly higher noise exposures occurred among employees of small companies, among workers with a job classification of truck driver, among males, and among black workers. Hearing protection usage was low, with 48% of subjects reporting that they never used hearing protection. Hearing impairment, as defined by NIOSH, was present among 37% of 275 subjects with valid audiograms, Black male workers and white male workers had higher hearing thresholds than males from a comparison North Carolina population unexposed to industrial noise. Small but statistically significant changes in hearing thresholds occurred following full shift noise exposure among subjects who had good hearing sensitivity at baseline. In a logistic regression model, age and history of a past noisy job were significant predictors of hearing impairment. Overall, sand and gravel workers have excessive noise exposures and significant hearing loss, and demonstrate inadequate use of hearing protection. Well-designed hearing conservation programs, with reduction of noise exposure, are clearly needed.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the validity of measures of noise exposure derived retrospectively for a cohort of nuclear energy workers for the period 1950-98, by investigating their ability to predict hearing loss. Method(s): Subjects were men aged 45-65 chosen from a larger group of employees-assembled for a nested case-control study of noise and death from ischaemic heart disease-who had had at least one audiogram after at least five years' work. Average hearing loss, across both ears and the frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, was calculated from the last audiogram for each man. Previous noise exposure at work was assessed retrospectively by three hygienists using work histories, noise survey records from 1965-98, and judgement about use of hearing protection devices. Smoking and age at the time of the audiogram were extracted from records. Differences in hearing loss between men categorised by cumulative noise exposure were assessed after controlling for age, smoking, year of test, and previous test experience. Result(s): There were 186 and 150 eligible subjects at sites A and B of the company respectively who were employed for an average of 20 years. Compared to men with less than one year's exposure to levels of 85dB(A) or greater, hearing loss was greater by 3.7 dB (90% CI -2.6 to 10.1), 3.8 dB (90% CI -2.6 to 10.3), 7.0 dB (90% CI 1.1 to 12.9) and 10.1 dB (90% CI 4.2 to 16.0) in the lowest to highest categories of cumulative noise exposure at site B. In contrast, at site A, the corresponding figures were 22 dB, -2.4 dB, -1.8 dB, and -4.4 dB, with no confidence interval excluding zero. Conclusion(s): Noise estimation at one site was shown to have predictive validity in terms of hearing loss, but not at the other site. Reasons for the differences between sites are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine daily noise doses and 8-hour time weighted averages for rock band musicians, crew members, and spectators during a typical rehearsal and performance using both Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) measurement criteria. Design(s): Personal noise dosimetry was completed on five members of a rock band during one 2-hr rehearsal and one 4-hr performance. Time-weighted averages (TWA) and daily dose values were calculated using both OSHA and NIOSH criteria and compared to industry guidelines for enrollment in hearing conservation programs and the use of hearing protection devices. Result(s): TWA values ranged from 84.3 to 90.4 dBA (OSHA) and from 90.0 to 96.4 dBA (NIOSH) during the rehearsal. The same values ranged from 91.0 to 99.7 dBA (OSHA) and 94.0 to 102.8 dBA (NIOSH) for the performance. During the rehearsal, daily noise doses ranged from 45.54% to 106.7% (OSHA) and from 317.74% to 1396.07% (NIOSH). During the performance, doses ranged from 114.66% to 382.49% (OSHA) and from 793.31% to 5970.15% (NIOSH). Conclusion(s): The musicians in this study were exposed to dangerously high levels of noise and should be enrolled in a hearing conservation programs. Hearing protection devices should be worn, especially during performances. The OSHA measurement criteria yielded values significantly more conservative than those produced by NIOSH criteria. Audiologists should counsel musician-patients about the hazards of excessive noise (music) exposure and how to protect their hearing.

AB  - The goal of this project was to determine whether one type of earplug would allow a user to hear communication in a noisy environment better than two other types of earplugs. The three types of earplugs studied are newly available on the market. Sonomax SonoCustoms are custom fitted to the user. E-A-R Push-Ins are the newest form of foam earplugs, and Howard Leight SmartFits have an adaptable shape. One of the earplug manufacturers claimed to have improved verbal communications due to the design of the earplug. We hypothesized that the type of earplug providing better communication properties would have lower attenuation around the communication frequencies compared with the other types. To test this hypothesis, we used speech intelligibility and attenuation tests in the laboratory on 26 subjects, and real-time video exposure monitoring in the field (airport maintenance personnel) for visual communication cues. ANCOVA was used to analyze the data from the laboratory study. The type of earplug worn was not significant in the model (p-value 0.0849), nor was attenuation of the earplug (p-value 0.2379). Further analysis showed that attenuation did not differ significantly among earplugs (p-value 0.5903). Logistic regression was used to analyze the data from the field study. Again, the type of earplug was not significant in the model (p-value 0.0965). A comfort questionnaire determined that Howard Leight SmartFits and the E-A-R Push-Ins were more comfortable and easier to use than the Sonomax HPDs (p-value <0.0001). We found a definite difference between manufacturers' attenuation data and our attenuation data, especially in the frequencies for 125-1000 Hz. Also, there was no difference in frequency and overall attenuation among the HPDs. This resulted in no difference in communication abilities among the types of HPDs. Copyright © 2007 JOEH, LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing loss and tinnitus are prevalent in America, and noise-induced hearing loss is a leading cause of hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss has negative impact on quality of life, physical and emotional functioning, social life, and employment. In addition, noise-induced hearing loss results in heavy social and economic burdens on families and communities from all ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Farmers are a group that is particularly high risk for noise-induced hearing loss, and is underserved by programs designed to limit that risk. They are among the most noise-exposed group of workers, and experience the second highest prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among all occupational categories. In agriculture, 1.5 million workers (43.3%) report exposure to hazardous noise. Although use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) would protect them from noise-induced hearing loss, use among farmers is low., METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of this project is to compare the effectiveness of several approaches to influencing hearing protector use. Approaches include: a) an interactive, predictors-based intervention delivered via the Internet; b) a static informational web site; and c) a mailed sampler of hearing protectors. The goals are to further develop an intervention to promote farmers' use of HPDs, and compare the effectiveness of the interventions delivered in various combinations. Participants will include 701 farmers. Sites will be affiliates of a major farmer organization. Data will be collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. A random intercept mixed model will be used to explore the fixed effects of the three NIHL prevention interventions over time while adjusting for age and gender. This project will involve a partnership between the University of Michigan and a major farmer organization to accomplish project aims., DISCUSSION: Results of this study will be used to inform future research-to-practice studies to increase hearing protector use. Increased use of hearing protectors is expected to reduce rates of noise-induced hearing loss and other negative effects of high noise exposure, and improve quality of life in this high-risk and underserved group., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01454895 Registered 14 October, 2011.

AB  - Noise represents one of the most common occupational health hazards. A Healthy People 2020 objective aims to reduce hearing loss in the noise-exposed public. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare perceived and measured hearing, and to determine the prevalence of hearing loss among a group of factory workers. Data collected as part of an intervention study promoting hearing protector use among workers at an automotive factory in the Midwest were used. Plant employees (n=2691) provided information regarding their perceived hearing ability, work role, and other demographics. The relationships among audiograms, a single-item measure of perceived hearing ability, and demographic data were explored using chi-square, McNemar's test, Mann-Whitney U-test, sensitivity, and specificity. The prevalence of hearing loss among noise-exposed factory workers was 42% (where hearing loss was defined as >25 dB loss at the OSHA-recommended frequencies of 2, 3, and 4 kHz in either ear). However, 76% of workers reported their hearing ability as excellent or good. The difference in perceived hearing ability was significant at each tested frequency between those with and without measured hearing loss. Self-reported hearing ability was poorly related to results of audiometry. Although this group of workers was employed in a regulated environment and served by a hearing conservation program, hearing loss was highly prevalent. These findings, together with national prevalence estimates, support the need for evaluation of hearing conservation programs and increased attention to the national goal of reducing adult hearing loss.

AB  - Farmers experience higher rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) than workers in most other industries. We developed a model of farmers' use of hearing protection, and tested it with a random sample (n = 532) of farmers from the upper Midwest. Barriers to using hearing protection (e.g., difficulty communicating; OR = .44, p < .003) were negatively related to use. Greater access/availability of hearing protectors (OR = 1.75, p < .010) and male gender (OR = .43, p < .019) were positively related to use. The model correctly predicted use of hearing protection for 74% of the cases. Overall, farmers demonstrated low hearing protector use, and results were similar to those from previous studies of non-farm workers. Findings from this study will be useful in designing interventions to increase farmers' hearing protector use and decrease their rates of NIHL. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although farm operators have frequent exposure to hazardous noise and high rates of noise-induced hearing loss, they have low use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Women represent about one-third of farm operators, and their numbers are climbing. However, among published studies examining use of HPDs in this worker group, none have examined gender-related differences. The purpose of this study was to examine gender-related differences in use of hearing protection and related predictors among farm operators., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data previously collected at farm shows and by telephone were analyzed using t-tests and generalized linear model with zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution., FINDINGS: The difference in rate of hearing protector use between men and women farm operators was not significant. There was no difference between men and women in most hearing protector-related attitudes and beliefs., CONCLUSION: Although men and women farm operators had similar rates of use of hearing protectors when working in high-noise environments, attitudes about HPD use differed. Specifically, interpersonal role modeling was a predictor of HPD use among women, but not for men. This difference suggests that while farm operators of both genders may benefit from interventions designed to reduce barriers to HPD use (e.g., difficulty communicating with co-workers and hearing warning sounds), farm women have unique needs in relation to cognitive-perceptual factors that predict HPD use. Women farm operators may lack role models for use of HPDs (e.g., in peers and advertising), contributing to their less frequent use of protection.

AB  - Background: Farm operators experience exposure to high noise and high prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss, but use of hearing protection in this worker group is low. The purpose of this study was to test a brief intervention to increase farm operators' use of hearing protection. +Methods: In this one-group pre- and post-test study, a random sample of 32 members of a farmers' organization was supplied a variety of hearing protectors. Participants received an assortment of hearing protectors by mail with manufacturer's instructions for use. +Results: Mean pre-intervention hearing protector use when in high noise in this group was 23% (SD 29). Of the 32 participants, 27 (84%) were exposed to hazardous noise during the study period. Post-intervention mean use of HPDs was 64%, an increase of 41% (t=5.26, P<000). +Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that overall, hearing protectors were acceptable to farm operators, and that a brief mailed intervention is feasible. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Farmers are exposed to hazardous noise from equipment and livestock and experience high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); however, their use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) is low. The purpose of this study was to describe farmers' personal experiences using HPDs, influencing others' use of HPDs, and overcoming barriers to the use of HPDs. A purposive sample of farmers who reported a high frequency of HPD use was selected for face-to-face interviews. Findings indicated that farmers have frequent exposure to hazardous noise. They described their motivation to adopt protective behaviors to avoid hearing loss, noise annoyance, or tinnitus. Many tried to influence others' use of HPD, particularly family members. These farmers have developed a variety of methods to ensure convenient access to HPDs when needed, and have developed effective techniques for overcoming common barriers to protection. Findings from this study will be used to form the foundation for future studies aimed at developing and testing an intervention to increase HPD use and decrease rates of NIHL among farmers.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of four NIHL prevention interventions at improving knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviors regarding sound exposure and appropriate use of hearing protective strategies in children. Design(s): A randomized trial of the four interventions with a non-intervention comparison group. Questionnaires were completed prior to, immediately after, and three months after each intervention. Study: Interventions included: (1) A classroom presentation by older-peer educators, (2) A classroom presentation by health professionals, (3). Exploration of a museum exhibition, and (4). Exploration of an internet-based virtual museum. A comparison group received no intervention. Study sample: Fifty-three fourth grade classrooms (1120 students) participated in the study. Result(s): All interventions produced significant improvements but the number of improvements decreased over time. In terms of effectiveness, the classroom programs were more effective than the internet-based virtual exhibit, which was more effective than the visit to the museum exhibition. Self-reported exposures indicated that as many as 94.5% of participants were at risk for NIHL. Conclusion(s): Interpersonal, interactive educational interventions such as the classroom program are more effective and have longer impact than self-directed learning experiences for NIHL and tinnitus prevention, however each may have an important role in promoting hearing health in elementary school students. © 2013 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - Objectives: The authors had a unique opportunity to study the early impacts of occupational and recreational exposures on the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in a cohort of 392 young workers. The objectives of this study were to estimate strength of associations between occupational and recreational exposures and occurrence of early-stage NIHL and to determine the extent to which relationships between specific noise exposures and early-stage NIHL were mitigated through the use of hearing protection. Method(s): Participants were young adults who agreed to participate in a follow-up of a randomised controlled trial. While the follow-up study was designed to observe long-term effects (up to 16 years) of a hearing conservation intervention for high school students, it also provided opportunity to study the potential aetiology of NIHL in this worker cohort. Study data were collected via exposure history questionnaires and clinical audiometric examinations. Result(s): Over the 16-year study period, the authors documented changes to hearing acuity that exceeded 15 dB at high frequencies in 42.8% of men and 27.7% of women. Analyses of risk factors for NIHL were limited to men, who comprised 68% of the cohort, and showed that risks increased in association with higher levels of the most common recreational and occupational noise sources, as well as chemical exposures with ototoxic potential. Use of hearing protection and other safety measures, although not universal and sometimes modest, appeared to offer some protection. Conclusion(s): Early-stage NIHL can be detected in young workers by measuring high-frequency changes in hearing acuity. Hearing conservation programmes should focus on a broader range of exposures, whether in occupational or non-occupational settings. Priority exposures include gunshots, chainsaws, power tools, smoking and potentially some chemical exposures.

AB  - While noise exposure is the most significant contributor to occupational hearing loss, evidence gained over the last 10 years, has pointed to organic solvents as additional contributors to occupational hearing disorders. Despite the implications of this finding, no significant measure has been undertaken to limit exposure to occupational solvents, or to occupational solvents and noise, within the European community. Guidelines for improving hearing protection of people exposed to solvents, or to solvents and noise, are addressed in the present article. Recently, it has been shown that the lowest-observed-adverse- effect level (LOAEL) of styrene was 300 ppm in active (working wheel) rats, and that the same amount of styrene-induced hearing loss (SIHL) can be obtained with styrene concentration difference of 200 ppm between active and sedentary (inactive) rats. Supported by a reasonable safety factor (SF) of 10, the authors proposed to decrease the French threshold limit value of styrene from 50 to 30 ppm (RfD = LOAEL/SF) to ensure a higher level of protection for human hearing. It is widely acknowledged that outer hair cells in the organ of Corti can be considered as the first target tissue of solvents, while little is known about the action of aromatic solvents on the auditory efferent system. In a recent experiment using both the cochlear microphonic and compound action potentials, the authors have shown that toluene can inhibit the action of the middle ear reflex by modifying the cholinergic receptors. It is likely that toluene affects the cholinergic receptors at the brainstem level. By its anticholinergic-like effect, toluene could allow higher acoustic energy penetration into the cochlea exposed to both noise and solvent. Based on this phenomenon, the authors recommend the use of hearing protection for the lower exposure action value: Lex,8h = 80 dB(A) in noisy environments polluted by solvents.

AB  - Background: In the absence of surgical treatments with demonstrable long-term efficacy, conservative treatments for snoring remain appropriate. Only limited evidence evaluating the use of ear protection by partners has been published. Method(s): Eligible couples were invited to participate in a two-month trial, with each partner using custom-moulded ear plugs. Five questionnaires were completed by patients and their partners, at baseline and after two months: the snoring outcomes survey (SOS) or the spouse/bed partners survey (SBPS), the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), the general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), the Nottingham health profile (NHP) and the Golombok-Rust inventory of marital status (GRIMS). Result(s): After two months, there was a significant improvement in the SOS score for patients (p = 0.005), the SBPS score for partners (p = 0.001) and the ESS for partners (p = 0.004). Conclusion(s): For selected couples, ear plugs represent an effective short-term treatment for some of the social effects of disruptive snoring, as determined by the SOS, SBPS and ESS questionnaires. © 2006 JLO (1984) Limited.

AB  - This work describes the audiometry threshold assessment of 1000 workers employed in different artisan categories during a period of ten-year noise professional exposure. The hearing loss noise-induced rates were determined by analysing audiometric tests at the beginning of our period of study and after 5 and 10 years of noise exposure. Environmental noise exposures were on average 88 dB(A), but near 90 dB(A) in some work categories. Workers widely used hearing protection devices, nearly at 93%, during the period we studied. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine should find out points of reference proving the efficiency and effectiveness of occupational physicians: in this case, a positive trend in the reduction of hearing loss rate will be expected to confirm the goodness of prevention practice. Our study suggests that the levels of protection so far accepted are not effective enough in order to reduce the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss in the course of the years: in despite of most accredited predicting models for hearing conservation programs, a significant percentage of workers exposed to industrial noise continues to present a high incidence of hearing loss. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine suggests that the proposed prevention activities carried out in the described factories were not enough effective.

AB  - Using hearing protectors during exposition to noise is fundamental to hearing loss prevention. The optimal choice of hearing protectors should take into consideration not only the physical characteristics of the acoustic environment which imply the traumatic action of noise, but also some individual preferences of the user. All contemporary produced hearing protectors both earmuffs as well as earplugs are made of synthetic polymers e.g. ABS, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polyurethathane, silicone rubbers. The type of the material used determines hardness, incompressibility and plasticity of the hear protector and may cause some discomfort. A special group of individuals exposed to noise are sport shooters in which (whose) case the exposition to impact noise is several times higher above standards. The aim of this work was an appraisal of the individual preferences in the choice of hearing protectors. The properties of polymers used for the production of hearing protectors were also taken into consideration. 104 females and 93 males representing master class were interviewed in this study. The analysis of the answers indicated that abandoning of hearing protectors by some shooters is due to the frequent skin irritations, overheating in the ear canal and allergy. Shooters linked these problems with the materials used for the production of hearing protectors. Earplugs were preferred by females, whereas males indicated earmuffs as their preferred choice. Females preferred earplugs made of soft materials which can be easily fitted to ear canal. Those males who used earplugs preferred protectors made of hard plastics as they thought this make better insulation. It can be concluded that the choice of the hearing protectors should not be done on the basis acoustic signal characteristics only, but also should reduce some discomforts resulting from properties of the materials used for their production.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the United States it is estimated that more than 30 million workers are exposed to harmful levels of noise on the job. When engineering or administrative controls cannot be used to reduce noise, workers should always use hearing protection devices (HPDs) when exposed to loud noise to prevent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Previous research has shown that workers do not always use HPDs when required; therefore, it is essential that workers assume personal responsibility for preventing NIHL by increasing their use of HPDs. OBJECTIVE(S): This study tested the effectiveness of an individually tailored multimedia intervention to increase use of HPDs by factory workers. METHOD(S): A randomized controlled design was used to compare the effects of a tailored intervention (n= 446) with two other interventions (a nontailored predictor-based intervention (n= 447) and a control intervention (n= 432)) on workers' self-reported use of HPDs 6 to 18 months following the intervention. RESULT(S): Only those workers receiving the tailored intervention significantly increased their use of HPDs from pretest to posttest. However, this increase significantly differed from the nontailored group but not from the control group. CONCLUSION(S): Individually-tailored interventions offer promise for changing behavior. In light of the similarity between the results for the tailored intervention and the control intervention groups, further research is needed to understand barriers to HPD use and how to maximize the benefits of individually tailored interventions in this setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: The continued prevalence of low rates of hearing protection device (HPD) use by workers exposed to hazardous noise requires ongoing efforts to investigate ways to increase HPD use. OBJECTIVE(S):: The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) for research with factory workers' use of HPDs, specifically focusing on the model suppositions related to the constructs of decisional balance and self-efficacy. METHOD(S):: Using secondary analysis, pretest measures were obtained through a randomized controlled clinical trial of an intervention to increase use of HPDs. The sample included in the analyses were factory workers (N <= 1,245) exposed to hazardous noise in a Midwestern automotive manufacturing plant. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the TTM constructs pros, cons, and self-efficacy of HPD use were examined across stages. RESULT(S):: Using ANOVA, significant variance was found across stages of HPD use. Pros, cons, and self-efficacy significantly differed by stage of HPD use in predicted patterns: pros, F(4, 1240) <= 46.29, p < .001; cons, F(4, 1240) <= 17.14, p < .001; and self-efficacy F(4, 1240) <= 7.32, p < .001. The crossover effect of pros and cons occurred in the preparation stage, as expected. CONCLUSION(S):: Support was found for the presence of conceptually distinct stages of HPD use and the TTM predictions for decisional balance and self-efficacy across stages. Performance of the TTM constructs within current research on HPD use presents opportunities for increased tailoring of training for factory workers on use of HPDs. Copyright © Lippincott & Wilkins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The provision of reinforcements or boosters to interventions is seen as a logical approach to enhancing or maintaining desired behavior. Empirical studies, however, have not confirmed the effectiveness of boosters nor assessed the optimum number of boosters or the timing for their delivery. OBJECTIVE(S): This randomized controlled trial contrasted the effect of four booster conditions (a). 30 days; (b). 90 days; (c). 30 and at 90 days; and (d). no boosters of the intervention to increase the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). METHOD(S): A total of 1325 factory workers completed a computerized questionnaire and were randomly assigned to one of three computer-based (tailored, nontailored predictor-based, or control) multimedia interventions designed to increase the use of hearing protection devices. After the intervention, colorful boosters specific to the type of training received were mailed to workers' homes. Posttest measures of use were administered at the time of their next annual audiogram 6 to 18 months after the intervention.RESULTS Repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant main effect for the booster (after 30 days) in the group that received tailored training (F[3442] = 2.722; p =.04). However, in the assessment of the interaction between time (pretest and posttest) and boosters (four groups), the ANOVA did not find significant differences in hearing protection device use for any of the training groups. To assess for significant differences between groups, post hoc comparisons were conducted at the pretest and posttest for the total sample and for the subsample of workers who reported using hearing protection devices less than 100% of the time needed. Sheffe contrasts by intervention group, gender, ethnicity, and hearing ability found no significant changes in the mean use of hearing protection devices for the booster groups. CONCLUSION(S): Although the provision of boosters represented a considerable commitment of resources, their use was not effective in this study. However, it would be premature to eliminate boosters of interventions. Further study is needed to explore the effects of different booster types for increasing the use of hearing protection devices, and to assess carefully the effects of boosters on other health behaviors in studies with controlled designs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION. The intensive care unit is a hostile environment in nature. It is very common that sleep is impaired in lucid patients. The maintenance of the sleep-wake cycle has impact on patient health, beyond the humanitarian aspect. It has been described reduction of anxiety, catecholamine levels, pain perception, among others. OBJECTIVES. Describe the sleep control program, adopted in a general brazilian ICU from the analysis of interviews with patients after discharge. METHODS. This prospective observational study in an ICU of 23 beds. In 2011, based on the analysis of research in the ICU after discharge, we performed the measurement of environmental noise at different times of day and night in the ICU with a decibel meter Brand ICEL model DL-4050. With these results we started a phase of training with the team, forming a team of "Good Night Cinderella" responsible for monitoring the noise level, lighting and provision of a kit for the hospitalized patient. This kit is composed of ear plugs and eye mask. RESULTS. The questionnaires after discharge showed that 29.3 % of patients complained of insomnia (29.24 %) and 29.24 % of the noise. Measurements of ambient noise ranged from 58 to 68.4 dB. In our country the recommended noise levels for acustic confort in ICU are 25-35 dB CONCLUSIONS. The maintenance of sleep-wake cycle should be part of good practice in an ICU, with participation of the entire multidisciplinary team. Controlling environmental stressors, as well as changing the behavior of staff, and the introduction of pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures form the pillars of this policy of comfort.

AB  - Introduction. Interventions aimed at increasing comfort of patients treated with Helmet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (H-CPAP) increase its endurance and the duration of treatment. Aim. To assess the effect of nursing interventions on factors of discomfort for H-CPAP patients. Methods. The fixing method of the helmet (5 subjects), the noise generated by the gas source and the level of humidity in the helmet were assessed. Fixing method: pain measured with Numeric rating scales (NRS) and Stress detector after the application of armpit straps or counterweights. Noise: level of noise (decibel measurement) in the helmet and the interventions to reduce it. Humidity: level of humidity with different models of active humidifiers. Results. The armpit straps increase the pain measured with the stress detector of 0.206 microSiemens and of 4.8 points of the NRS after 5 minutes. The system with counterweights does not increase pain. The Heath and Moisture Exchangers (HME) Filters and tubes with smooth inner surface decrease the level of noise in the helmet from 70 to 48 decibel, with a gas flow of 30 l/min. The humidification and warming of gases (26degreeC (-2 gradient) and warmed tubes) delivers a relative humidity of 33.9+/-1.9 mgH2O/l thus avoinding the steaming of the helmet. Conclusions. The use of counterweights, HME filters, tubes with smooth surface, ear plugs to reduce the noise level and active humidification and warming of gases reduce the discomfort associated to H-CPAP.

AB  - Background: Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are regarded as a valuable audiometric parameter that objectively reflects the function of outer hair cells (OHCs). Many studies have reported that the incidence of SOAEs in adults is less than 50%. Therefore, measurement of SOAEs may be of little value to clinical examinations. However, the incidence of SOAEs in infants and neonates is higher than in adults. Objective(s): To analyze the basic characteristics of SOAEs in 2-4 day old neonates, and to demonstrate the difference in OHC function between sexes and ears. Design, time and setting: Neurophysiological contrast study, performed in the Department of Neonates, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, between December 2007 and August 2008. Participant(s): A total of 112 newborns (224 ears) consisting of 59 females and 53 males were included in this study. Method(s): The probe was adapted and embedded in the neonate external auditory canal with a foam rubber earplug after checking and clearing up the outer ear canal. The presence of SOAEs was determined when the signal amplitude had a clear peak exceeding -30 dB, or was 3 dB above the noise floor. Main Outcome Measure(s): The incidence of SOAEs, the number of SOAE signal peaks, and the maximal tension of SOAEs. Result(s): The incidence in females (79.7%) was higher than males (76.4%) (P > 0.05), and the incidence in right ears (86.6%) was higher than in left ears (69.6%) (P < 0.05). There were no significant difference in the number of SOAE peaks between females and males (4.49 vs. 4.28), or between right ears and left ears (4.62 vs. 4.12) (P > 0.05). The mean maximum SOAE level per ear in females (-3.29 +/- 9.28) dB sound pressure level (SPL) was slightly higher than that in males (-3.91 +/- 9.14) dB SPL (P > 0.05). Also, the mean maximum SOAE level in right ears (-2.03 +/- 9.11) dB SPL was higher than in left ears (-5.50 +/- 9.65) dB SPL (P < 0.05). The maximum SOAE level showed a positive correlation with maximum SOAE number in emitting ears (r = 0.55, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): The incidence of SOAEs in neonates is high (78.1%) within 4 days of birth. The incidence of SOAEs and the maximum SOAE level exhibited a significant difference between right and left ears, but the difference between sexes was insignificant. Both the strongest SOAE signal peak and number of SOAEs per ear are representative of the function OHCs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a definitive, randomised controlled trial of earplugs as a noise-abatement strategy to improve sleep and reduce delirium in patients admitted to the intensive care unit., DESIGN AND SETTING: An open-label trial of 40 patients randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive earplugs in addition to standard care, or standard care alone, conducted in a 10-bed ICU of a large, private hospital in Perth, Western Australia., PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Patients were eligible for participation if they were expected to be undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) on admission to the ICU. Patients assigned to receive earplugs had earplugs placed on admission to the ICU and were offered earplug placement between 10 pm and 6 am for the first night in the ICU once they were extubated. Earplugs were not provided for patients assigned to standard care., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome of study feasibility was assessed using criteria for acceptability of the intervention and protocol compliance., RESULTS: Of the 20 participants randomised to receive earplugs, 19 had earplugs placed within 6 hours of ICU admission, corresponding to 76% of the MV time (mean time with earplugs, 7.5 hours [SD, 5.3 hours]). Earplugs were placed for 18 of 20 participants during their first full night after extubation, corresponding to 78% of the total overnight time (mean time with earplugs, 6.2 hours [SD, 2.5 hours])., CONCLUSION: A definitive study of earplugs as a noiseabatement strategy for patients admitted to the ICU is feasible on the basis of participant acceptability of the intervention and protocol compliance., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615001125516.

AB  - Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of earplugs as an ICU strategy for reducing delirium. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials were searched using the terms "intensive care," "critical care," "earplugs," "sleep," "sleep disorders," and "delirium." Study Selection: Intervention studies (randomized or nonrandomized) assessing the efficacy of earplugs as a sleep hygiene strategy in patients admitted to a critical care environment were included. Studies were excluded if they included only healthy volunteers, did not report any outcomes of interest, did not contain an intervention group of interest, were crossover studies, or were only published in abstract form. Data Extraction: Nine studies published between 2009 and 2015, including 1,455 participants, fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. Studies included earplugs as an isolated intervention (n = 3), or as part of a bundle with eye shades (n = 2), or earplugs, eye shades, and additional sleep noise abatement strategies (n = 4). The risk of bias was high for all studies. Data Synthesis: Five studies comprising 832 participants reported incident delirium. Earplug placement was associated with a relative risk of delirium of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.44-0.78) and no significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2, 39%; p = 0.16). Hospital mortality was reported in four studies (n = 481) and was associated with a relative risk of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.54-1.11; I2, 0%; p < 0.001). Compliance with the placement of earplugs was reported in six studies (n = 681). The mean per-patient noncompliance was 13.1% (95% CI, 7.8-25.4) of those assigned to receive earplugs. Conclusion(s): Placement of earplugs in patients admitted to the ICU, either in isolation or as part of a bundle of sleep hygiene improvement, is associated with a significant reduction in risk of delirium. The potential effect of cointerventions and the optimal strategy for improving sleep hygiene and associated effect on patient-centered outcomes remains uncertain.

AB  - This study examined the effect of the interior sounds of an aircraft cockpit on ratings of affect and expected performance decrement. While exposed to 12 interior aircraft sounds, of which half were modified to correspond to what is experienced with an active noise reduction (ANR) headset, 23 participants rated their affective reactions and how they believed their performance on various tasks would be affected. The results suggest that implementation of ANR-technique has a positive effect on ratings of expected performance. In addition, affective reactions to the noise are related to ratings of expected performance. The implications of these findings for both research and pilot performance are discussed. © Perceptual & Motor Skills 2013.

AB  - Background & Hypothesis: Noise-induced deafness (NID) is the leading occupational disease reported in Singapore, contributing a significant disease burden. This study aims to understand workers' attitudes about advanced NID (NID(A)), the effects of NID(A) on workers, and the effectiveness of NID prevention programmes. Method(s): Qualitative mixed-method analysis was conducted for 14 workers randomly selected from 71 NID(A) cases (2001 to 2010) sourced from the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore. In-depth interviews were conducted and analysed using qualitative thematic analysis and grounded theory, to obtain a summary distillation of experiences, find associations between themes, and explain the findings. Result(s): Most recognised NID as a significant problem, citing communication difficulties as a key concern. NID(A) affected work productivity in more than half the workers. Provision and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and education on NID prevention, were identified as key factors behind the success or failure of hearing protection programmes. Intrapersonal and interpersonal influences were crucial for behavioural change to promote PPE usage. Self-reliance was the strongest theme for NID prevention, where many felt that the inherent desire to comply with hearing protection was the determining factor in preventing NID. General sentiment was that education should focus on easily understandable concepts and methods for NID prevention, and on reinforcing PPE use. Discussion & Conclusion(s): Empowering workers for self-care, and improving education for NID prevention and PPE usage, are essential in hearing conservation programmes. Health behaviour interventions to improve PPE usage should focus at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. Future research could assess specific means of improving education modalities or methods.

AB  - The BG expert committee "Personal Protective Equipment", in cooperation with the BG Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BGIA), has established an interdisciplinary working group to develop testing criteria for awarding the certification mark BG-PRUFZERT "Schadstoffarme Gehorschutzer" (low pollutant hearing protection devices). In an initial step of the process, the working group agreed to an adequate testing procedure that should serve as a convention for the chemical analyses to be performed in the framework of the certification. The substances to be determined included metals and half-metals (arsenic, antimony, lead, tin), tin-organic compounds, as well as phthalates. The procedures were tested to determine their suitability and/or validity within a round-robin test in which three laboratories participated. In a parallel process, toxicological and regulatory information on products for everyday use that contain the same critical substances were evaluated in order to permit the derivation of analogous conclusions on maximum acceptable concentration levels. Finally, the limit values for awarding the test mark were set under consideration of the technical feasibility of manufacturing the ear protection devices, the detection limits of the analytic procedure, and previous experience in toxicology.

AB  - Background The association between distraction caused by cell phone use while driving and driver/passenger fatalities has been documented, but the safety risks associated with headphone use by pedestrians remains unknown. Objective To identify and describe pedestrianevehicle crashes in which the pedestrian was using headphones. Methods A retrospective case series was conducted by searching the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, US Consumer Product Safety Commission, Google News Archives and Westlaw Campus Research databases for reports published between 2004 and 2011 of pedestrian injuries or fatalities from crashes involving trains or motor vehicles. Cases involving headphones were extracted and summarised. The likelihood of headphone involvement was graded on a three-tier scale based on the information found in the article or report. Results There were 116 reports of death or injury of pedestrians wearing headphones. The majority of victims were male (68%) and under the age of 30 (67%). The majority of vehicles involved in the crashes were trains (55%), and 89% of cases occurred in urban counties. 74% of case reports stated that the victim was wearing headphones at the time of the crash. Many cases (29%) mentioned that a warning was sounded before the crash. Conclusions The use of headphones with handheld devices may pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving vehicles. Further research is needed to determine if and how headphone use compromises pedestrian safety.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Electronic hearing protection devices are increasingly used in noisy environments. Theses devices feature a miniaturized external microphone and internal loudspeaker in addition to an analog or digital electronic circuit. They can transmit useful audio signals such as speech and warning signals to the protected ear and can reduce the sound pressure level using dynamic range compression. In the case of a digital electronic circuit, the transmission of audio signals may be noticeably delayed because of the latency introduced by the digital signal processor and by the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. These delayed audio signals will hence interfere with the audio signals perceived naturally through the passive acoustical path of the device. The proposed study presents an original procedure to evaluate, for two representative passive earplugs, the shortest delay at which human listeners start to perceive two sounds composed of the signal transmitted through the electronic circuit and the passively transmitted signal. This shortest delay is called the echo threshold and represents the delay between the time of perception of one fused sound from two separate sounds. In this study, a transient signal, a clean speech signal, a speech signal corrupted by factory noise, and a speech signal corrupted by babble noise are used to determine the echo thresholds of the two earplugs. Twenty untrained listeners participated in this study, and were asked to determine the echo thresholds using a test software in which attenuated signals are delayed from the original signals in real-time. The findings show that when using hearing devices, the echo threshold depends on four parameters: (a) the attenuation function of the device, (b) the duration of the signal, (c) the level of the background noise and (d) the type of background noise. Defined here as the shortest time delay at which at least 20% of the participants noticed an echo, the echo threshold was found to be 8 ms for a bell signal, 16 ms for clean speech and 22 ms for speech corrupted by babble noise when using a shallow earplug fit. When using a deep fit, the echo threshold was found to be 18 ms for a bell signal and 26 ms for clean speech and 68 ms for speech in factory. No echo threshold could be clearly determined for the speech signal in babble noise with a deep earplug fit.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Commercial fishing continues to have one of the highest rates of occupational fatalities compared with other work sectors in the United States. Attitudes/beliefs among Vietnamese shrimp fishermen of the Gulf of Mexico may influence behaviors that are risk factors for fatal and nonfatal injuries. The study employs a community trial with quasi-experimental pretest/posttest intervention design. An advisory group made up of key stakeholders including representatives from the US Coast Guard was assembled. A survey was designed using the Theory of Planned Behavior as the theoretical framework. Three community groups at port sites along the Texas/Louisiana Gulf Coasts were identified. Focus groups were convened at each site to select priority areas for risk intervention using training and awareness measures. Initial and follow-up surveys were administered pre-/post-interventions for each of the three community groups (2008, n = 217 completed surveys; 2012, n = 206 completed surveys). The follow-up survey was condensed and "intent to act" questions were added for the priority concerns identified (noise-induced hearing loss, machinery/winches, and fatigue). Statistically significant changes (P ranging from .000 to .042) were observed in selective attitude/belief responses for hearing/noise and fatigue. Intent to action or to adopt the intervention was high among all three groups of shrimp fishermen (hearing conservation, 82.4%; machinery/winch safety, 94.6%; fatigue awareness, 95.3%). Simple, yet culturally appropriate training and awareness measures in the form of visual and written safety messages favorably influence attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intent related to priority risk factors identified by Vietnamese commercial shrimp fishermen along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts.

AB  - Transmission losses (TL) to highly impulsive signals generated by three firearms have been measured for two ear muffs, using both a head and torso simulator and a miniature microphone located at the ear canal entrance (MIRE technique). Peak SPL TL have been found to be well approximated by 40 ms short-L eq TL. This has allowed the use of transmissibilities and correction factors for bone conduction and physiological masking appropriate for continuous noise, for the calculation of REAT-type peak insertion losses (IL). Results indicate that peak IL can be well predicted by estimates based on one-third octave band 40 ms short L eq and manufacturer-declared (nominal) IL measured for continuous noise according to test standards. Such predictions tend to be more accurate at the high end of the range, while they are less reliable when the attenuation is lower. A user-friendly simplified prediction algorithm has also been developed, which only requires nominal IL and one-third octave sound exposure level spectra. Separate predictions are possible for IL in direct and diffuse sound fields, albeit with higher uncertainties, due to the smaller number of experimental data comprising the two separate datasets on which such predictions are based.

AB  - The attenuation variability of hearing protector devices plays a primary role in determining compliance, or lack of, with occupational noise exposure limits. This study presents an estimate of the ear muff attenuation variability, which includes several factors (biological diversity, positioning, sound field, ageing) for which specific information from laboratory studies is available. A mean value of the attenuation variability for ear muffs sigma(FR) = 4.8 dB is found. This value is about 65% larger than the typical value measured according to existing test standards. Being marginally smaller than the mean variability resulting from field measurements, and certainly within the wide range of fluctuations of the latter, it represents a robust and reliable quantity for application in any workplace environment.

AB  - Purpose: Noise exposure is an important and highly prevalent occupational hazard in the construction industry. This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO-1999. Method(s): In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29,644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO-1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time and the use of hearing protection. Result(s): Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO-1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO-1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO-1999. Discussion(s): Duration of noise exposure was a better predictor than noise exposure levels, probably because of the limitations in noise exposure estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased at the same rate as is predicted for longer exposure durations. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - Noise is known that the physical risk factors defined as any unwanted sound. It can induce the health problems such as hearing loss or annoyance. The objective of this study was to assess the occupational noise exposure of nine groups for twenty peoples according to job characteristics and to compare the noise level by different variables. Personal noise levels were measured for three times using by dosimeters for each participant in Korea. The mean time weighted average noise level (TWA) of total was 73.2 +/- 11.5 dBA by American conference of governmental industrial hygienists (ACGIH) standard. Especially, Korean classical music students were highly exposed to 93.2 +/- 6.2 dBA but, office workers were 63.2 +/- 6.6 dBA. In case of peak sound pressure level (Lpeak), Korean classical music students and firefighters were exposed to the highest level of 151.8 dBC and 145.8 dBC during playing and dispatching, respectively. The analysis of noise level showed that Leq had positive correlations between TWA by ministry of employment and labour (MOEL) (r = 0.98, p < 0.01) and TWA by ACGIH (r = 0.98, p < 0.01). Unlikely other groups, the noise exposure level of the Korean classical music students were exceeded the ACGIH standard. These results suggest that Korean classical music students were exposed high noise level and some solutions are need to reduce the noise exposure level such as using hearing protect device.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine optimum locations of alarm devices and the effects of hearing protection in an extremely noisy environment. A machining facility has been selected as a working environment because it usually generates extremely high noise level. First, an analytical model is presented for predicting the optimal number of alarm devices, their locations, and their sound intensities if equipment operators have no hearing protection (Case 1). LINGO, optimization software of LINDO Systems Inc., is used for an analytical tool in this study. Second, the optimal solutions are evaluated for their feasibility in the following two cases: the first case in which some operators have hearing protection at or above 90 dBA (Case 2) and the other case in which all operators have hearing protection regardless of noise levels (Case 3). Tukey-Kramer tests of the three cases are conducted to find if the significant effects of hearing protection devices exist. The results support the maximum permissible noise level of 85 dBA. Thus, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard of hearing protection should be stricter because hearing loss may be expected due to high alarm sound by a masking effect of background noise in extremely noisy manufacturing facilities. Relevance to industry: The study provides facility planners and safety engineers with a model that may assist in positioning alarms in a noisy environment. The results may help to support the national standard of hearing protection use. In addition, the results may provide guidelines to solve other alarm location problems relating to the intensity of sound. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - PURPOSE: Assess prevalence of self-reported hearing difficulties among experienced dental hygienists who have been practicing for a minimum of 20 years and explore the relationship between hearing difficulties and occupational noise exposure from ultrasonic scalers. METHOD(S): A 19-item survey was mailed to a random sample of 1,067 dental hygienists who had obtained their California licenses between 1972 and 1992. To estimate the prevalence of hearing difficulty, binomial proportion and associated 95% confidence interval are presented. Logistic regression model of hearing difficulty was used to assess an association with ultrasonic scaler use. RESULT(S): Response rate was 35% (n=372/1,067). The prevalence of self-reported hearing difficulty was 40% (95% confidence interval, 35 to 44%). Of the 17% (95% confidence interval, 14 to 21%) of respondents that reported hearing difficulty due to ultrasonic scalers, most (91%) reported that their hearing difficulty was confirmed by an audiologist. Respondents with hearing difficulty due to scalers were 2-times (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6, p=0.03) more likely to report significantly higher scaler use than those who did not have hearing difficulty after adjusting for age and other potential causes of hearing difficulties. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of hearing difficulty at 40% among dental hygienists with an average age of 56 years was considerably higher than the reported national average at 17% for adults 70 years or older. Long-term noise exposure to dental equipment, such as ultrasonic scalers, may contribute to hearing difficulties among experienced dental hygienists. Ear protection is suggested as a preventive measure while using noisy dental equipment.Copyright © 2015 The American Dental Hygienists' Association.

AB  - Helicopter pilots are exposed to noise at work and are at risk of developing hearing loss in excess of that which naturally results from aging. We investigated whether Lynx pilots demonstrated changes to hearing thresholds that differed from Apache pilots. Survey responses were combined with audiometric data from a retrospective cohort of 59 Lynx and 87 Apache pilots. Subjects' audiograms were analyzed for air conduction thresholds with age correction performed in accordance with ISO 7029. Annual changes in low frequencies (0.5-2 kHz) and high frequencies (3-6 kHz) were calculated. Subjects were categorized for time in service and flying hours. Hearing was better than predicted at nearly all frequencies in both ears for Lynx and Apache pilots. There were no differences in hearing between groups of pilots. Significant differences in hearing threshold changes existed for pilots with 20 or more years of service compared to those in other categories. The results suggest that the circumaural earmuffs currently incorporated into the flying helmet mitigate the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in these pilots.

AB  - Background: Both continuous and impact noise exposures of rail yards and railways have been historically understudied. We summarize noise exposures to rail workers at a large chemical facility in North America. Method(s): Rail workers were surveyed over the course of three 12-hr shifts. Personal noise dosimeters were used to derive a 12-hr time-weighted average (LAVG), an 8-hr time-weighted average (LTWA) and a percent dose. Peak and maximum sound levels were also recorded during each sampling period. Six workers were sampled on three separate days for a total of 18 full-shift noise samples. Result(s): Full-shift noise exposures were all below the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) and action level for a 12-hr workday. Peak impact sound levels exceeded 140 dB in 17 of 18 samples (94%) with a mean peak sound level of 143.9 dB. Maximum continuous sound levels were greater than 115 dBA in 4 of 18 samples (22%) with a mean maximum sound level of 113.1 dBA. The source of peak impact sound levels was a daily exposure to a concussion caused by a sudden break in a freight airline. Conclusion(s): Rail workers at this facility are at risk of noise induced hearing loss from high impact noise exposures. Peak impact and maximum continuous sound levels can be attenuated through the use of hearing protection or by increasing distances from railroad noise sources. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the adolescents' attitudes toward loud music in relation to a set of self-perceived auditory symptoms and psychological variables such as norms, preparedness to take risks and risk-judgment in noisy situations. A questionnaire on hearing and preventive behavior was distributed to 281 upper secondary school students aged 15-19 years. The questionnaire included youth attitude to noise scale, questions about perceived hearing symptoms such as tinnitus and sound sensitivity and finally statements on perceived behavioral norms regarding hearing protection use, risk-taking and risk-judgment in noisy settings. Self-perceived auditory symptoms such as sound sensitivity and permanent tinnitus had a significant relationship with less tolerant attitudes toward loud music. Permanent tinnitus and sound sensitivity together accounted for 15.9% of the variation in attitudes toward loud music. Together with the psychological variables norms, preparedness to take risks and risk-judgment 48.0% of the variation in attitudes could be explained. Although perceived hearing symptoms (sound sensitivity and permanent tinnitus) was associated with less tolerant attitudes toward loud music, psychological variables such as norms, preparedness to take risks and risk-judgment were found to be more strongly associated with attitudes toward loud music and should therefore be considered more in future preventive work. Health promotive strategies should focus on changing not merely individual attitudes, but also societal norms and regulations in order to decrease noise induced auditory symptoms among adolescents.

AB  - The aim of the study was to find out whether firefighters' professional exposure to the noise of sirens, motor water pumps and transportation by heavy vehicles causes biauricular hearing impairment. Furthermore, on the basis of the results the aim was to find out whether it is necessary to launch a hearing preservation program and additional health protection measures for this specific working population. The method of physical examination and audiometry was used. Thirty-four professional firefighters from Opatija and 30 workers of Rijeka Promet employed at the town parking lots underwent audiometry on a Sibelmed AC 50 device and then analyzed. The results of biauricular audiometry showed significant differences in hearing damage between the firefighters and Rijeka Promet employees at higher frequencies where hearing damage begins, i.e. at 4 kHz and 8 kHz (P<0.05). The firefighters maximal hearing loss of 30.58+/-24.66 dB for the right ear at 4 kHz and of 28.52+/-24.66 dB for the right ear at 8 kHz were higher than the hearing loss of the parking lot employees with maximal hearing loss of 17.00+/-13.10 dB at 4 kHz and of 16.33+/-13.89 dB at 8 kHz. The results of left ear audiometry were very close to those of right ear in both groups of subjects. The linear regression analysis yielded almost identical positive correlation between the time spent at the job and hearing damage, with correlation factor r=+.55 for the right and left ear at 4 kHz. The noise was measured at the Opatija Fire Station. Several measurements were performed: on the premises where firefighters are exposed to so-called communal noise, measurements at 2 m of the fire truck when sirens are sounded, noise measurements in driver's cab when sirens are sounded, and the noise made by motor water pump used in firefighting. Also, measurements were performed on the spot, i.e. at the working place of parking lot employees in the center of Rijeka where they stay most of the time, and on the street by the parking lot. It may be concluded that noise-induced hearing damage in firefighters is a major problem in this working population, their physical and mental condition being very good, which is to be expected of the groups of operatives on whom the lives of >>ordinary<>limited service<< due to hearing damage, although their hearing was good when they started the career. Hearing in the young population is generally good, in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County the average hearing level is 10 dB at all routine frequencies on audiometry, so hearing damage is not among illnesses that might cause difficulties to young recruits. To conclude, to preserve good hearing in both young and experienced firefighters, the Hearing Preservation Program should be more strictly implemented in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County.

AB  - Classical musicians are often exposed to sound levels that exceed the Finnish national action limit value of 85 dB(A). Still, the use of hearing protectors is uncommon among musicians. The purpose of this study was to find out musician's attitudes towards hearing protectors, and under which conditions hearing protectors are used. The study group consisted of five major classical orchestras in the Helsinki region. The players were asked to fill out a questionnaire with questions on hearing protection, ear symptoms, including tinnitus, hearing loss, pain in the ears, and temporary ringing in the ears. Also, questions concerning stress and working environments were asked. Of those who responded, 94% were concerned about their hearing to some degree. Only 6% of the musicians always used hearing protector devices (HPDs). Selfreported hearing loss was quite common, with 31% of the musicians reporting some hearing loss. Temporary tinnitus was even more common at 37%. There were 15% of women, and 18% of men reporting permanent tinnitus. Hyper-acousis was reported by 43% of the musicians. The ear symptoms affected the usage rate. Hearing protectors were used more often among musicians having ear symptoms (20%) than those reporting no symptoms (6%). Further, the 43% of the musicians found their work to be interesting and meaningful. Stress was experienced to some extent by 60%, and musicians with ear symptoms had three to nine times more stress and felt their working environment noisier. The study shows that musicians seldom use hearing protectors before symptoms begin. Symptoms increased usage rate, but the usage levels are still far from ideal. Motivation and training is needed to improve hearing protector use among musicians.

AB  - Objectives The epidemiology of NIHL in New Zealand is poorly understood and more information is needed to identify effective strategies to prevent hearing loss. The objective was to review the current epidemiology of NIHL in New Zealand and examine noise sources, exposures and the effectiveness of existing noise control strategies in small to medium sized enterprises. Methods Modelling was undertaken to predict rates of noise exposure and thus of the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss in different occupations and economic sectors in New Zealand industry. A case study design was utilised to identify, describe and evaluate noise sources, exposures and control strategies used by "high", "moderate" and "low" risk industry sectors in relation to exposure to noise. Results Exposure estimates are presented that question whether the model provides adequate approximations to levels of occupational noise exposure in New Zealand workplaces. Thirty three (33) small business workplaces were assessed, which showed that generally noise sources and paths could be readily identified and that area and personal sound level exposure measurements varied considerably between the high, moderate and low risk industry sectors. The predominant noise control strategy used by small businesses was the use of personal hearing protection. Most enterprises surveyed did not conform to the specific requirements of legislative standards for noise management. Conclusions The findings suggest that the regulatory priority given to personal protection and hearing conservation programmes needs to be re-evaluated and that there needs to be significant changes in expectations with respect to policing the requirements of noise legislation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Radio communication remains important for the delivery of safety-critical information in military aviation. Pilots are exposed to high noise levels. Noise attenuation provided by certain helmets is not sufficient, and resulting noise exposure can deteriorate operational effectiveness and flight safety. A need for hearing protection that enables efficient communication is obvious, especially for fighter and helicopter pilots. One possible solution for this issue is molded communication earplugs (m-CEP). Data about the advantages and disadvantages of m-CEPs are limited., METHODS: To determine the usage rates, advantages, disadvantages and pilot opinions about m-CEPs, an anonymous survey study including 31 questions was conducted in fighter, fighter trainer, helicopter, and transport aircraft units of the Finnish Defense Forces., RESULTS: Of the pilots who responded, 136 (93%) had used or tried m-CEPs and 90 (62%) were currently using them. There are many benefits to m-CEPs: they seem to enhance experienced speech intelligibility, since 85% of the pilots who had experience about them reported improved speech intelligibility under difficult hearing conditions, and 93% would recommend them to other pilots. It seems m-CEPs provide equal benefits to pilots with and without current hearing problems. They were also considered better than previously used hearing protectors. Still, problems were common: 82% of the pilots reported m-CEP related drawbacks, of which technical problems and discomfort issues were the most prevalent., DISCUSSION: Most military pilots hold a positive opinion on m-CEPs and are willing to recommend their use. Technical problems and discomfort issues are, however, relatively common.

AB  - Introduction: Despite technological advances in conveying information, speech communication is still a key safety factor in aviation. Effective radio communication is necessary, for example, in building and maintaining good team situation awareness. However, little has been reported concerning the prevalence and nature of radio communication problems in everyday working environments in military aviation. Method(s): We surveyed Finnish Defense Forces pilots regarding the prevalence of radio speech communication problems. Result(s): Of the 225 pilots contacted, 75% replied to our survey. Altogether 138 of the respondents were fixed-wing pilots and 31 were helicopter pilots. Problems in radio communication occurred, on average, during 14% of flight time. The most prevalent problems were multiple speakers on the same radio frequency band causing overlapping speech, missing acknowledgments, high background noise especially during helicopter operations, and technical problems. Of the respondents, 18% (31 pilots) reported having encountered at least one potentially dangerous event caused by problems in radio communication during their military aviation career. If the employer were to offer extra hearing protection, such as custom-made ear plugs, 93% of the pilots indicated that they would use it. Discussion(s): Communication can be a flight safety factor especially during intense air combat exercises and other information-loaded flights. During these situations, communication should be clear and focused on the most essential information. So, training and technical improvements are necessary for better communication. High quality radio speech communication also improves operational effectiveness in military aviation. Copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.

AB  - Introduction : High noise levels in the ICU are not uncommon and cause sleep disruption, which has a major impact on well-being and recovery from illness. Postoperative delirium, compromised immune function, and prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation have all been associated with sleep deprivation.1 In healthy volunteers, the use of earplugs resulted in improved sleep quality during exposure to ICU typical noise as evidenced by polysomnography. We therefore investigated if wearing earplugs would also enhance subjective patient comfort during the first night on the ICU after cardiac surgery. Methods : Up to date, 59 patients volunteered to participate in this investigation. Patients with a history of sleep apnea, substance abuse, mental and pain disorders were excluded from the study. Twenty-four extubated patients wore earplugs between 10 PM and 6 AM, 35 patients received no earplugs and served as controls. Patient comfort was evaluated the next morning with a standardized questionnaire. Chi-square test and One-way ANOVA were employed to determine differences between groups. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results : The two groups were identical regarding demographic data, type of surgery, time to extubation (mean: 4.5 hrs), and the time they were admitted to the ICU. Tolerance of earplugs was generally reported as being good. According to attending nurses, communication with the patients was not impaired. Of the control patients, 35% (vs. 21%) and 79% (vs. 71%) reported delayed sleep onset and nocturnal awakening, respectively (P > 0.05). Pain assessed with the VAS-score was 4.0 +/- 2.0 in patients who wore earplugs and 4.7 +/- 2.8 in control patients (P > 0.05). There was no difference in dosage of administered opioids and adjuvant pain medication. On a scale from 1 (best) to 5 (worst), quality of sleep was rated 3.4 +/- 1.2 by control patients and 2.8 +/- 1.1 by treatment patients (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patient comfort, evaluated with the same scale, was significantly better in patients wearing earplugs as compared to controls (1.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.2; P < 0.05). Discussion : These preliminary data indicate that patient comfort during the first night on the ICU after cardiac surgery could most likely be improved with the help of this simple measure. Underlying this finding is a significantly better quality of sleep as judged by the patients who slept with earplugs. The large percentage of patients in both groups complaining of nocturnal awakening may be due to residual pain, anxiety, the uncommon environment, and the sleep position of the patients (i.e. strictly supine).

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to incorporate a service learning project in an undergraduate audiology course and evaluate how it affected student learning in the class., METHOD: The study involved partnering with a group of students enrolled in a band learning community. Students in the audiology course learned about hearing assessment procedures in class and practiced the procedures on each other in labs. Toward the end of the semester, they assessed the hearing of the band students and provided counseling regarding the importance of hearing protection. Qualitative data were obtained in the form of preflections and final reflection papers completed by the students in the audiology course at the start and conclusion of the semester. Quantitative data included completion of the Community Service Attitudes Scale (CSAS; Shiarella, McCarthy, & Tucker, 2000) prior to and at the conclusion of the course., RESULTS: Results revealed overwhelmingly positive comments from the students in their final reflections, although there were no significant changes in the pre- and post-administration of the CSAS., CONCLUSION: Incorporating service learning projects into undergraduate curricula in speech and hearing has the potential to enhance academic and civic learning while also benefitting the community.

AB  - Acoustic experience such as sound, noise, or absence of sound induces structural or functional changes in the central auditory system but can also affect limbic regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus. The amygdala is particularly sensitive to sound with valence or meaning, such as vocalizations, crying or music. The amygdala plays a central role in auditory fear conditioning, regulation of the acoustic startle response and can modulate auditory cortex plasticity. A stressful acoustic stimulus, such as noise, causes amygdala-mediated release of stress hormones via the HPA-axis, which may have negative effects on health, as well as on the central nervous system. On the contrary, short-term exposure to stress hormones elicits positive effects such as hearing protection. The hippocampus can affect auditory processing by adding a temporal dimension, as well as being able to mediate novelty detection via theta wave phase-locking. Noise exposure affects hippocampal neurogenesis and LTP in a manner that affects structural plasticity, learning and memory. Tinnitus, typically induced by hearing malfunctions, is associated with emotional stress, depression and anatomical changes of the hippocampus. In turn, the limbic system may play a role in the generation as well as the suppression of tinnitus indicating that the limbic system may be essential for tinnitus treatment. A further understanding of auditory-limbic interactions will contribute to future treatment strategies of tinnitus and noise trauma. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of hearing loss among children and adolescents is rising dramatically, caused mainly by increased exposure to recreational noise. OBJECTIVE(S): To present a systematic overview of the effectiveness of wearing earplugs to music venues, such as nightclubs and concert halls, to prevent hearing loss and tinnitus directly after exposure. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles from database inception to June 22, 2015, using the keywords music and earplugs and all synonyms. Titles, abstracts, and full text of retrieved articles were screened for eligible articles. The directness of evidence (relevance of the assessed articles) and risk of bias of eligible articles were assessed. For the included articles, the study characteristics and data on our outcomes of interest (hearing loss and tinnitus) were extracted. Data analysis occurred from June 22 to July 3, 2015. FINDINGS: Of 228 articles screened, 4 were eligible for critical appraisal. After critical appraisal, 2 studies with a high directness of evidence and low or moderate risk of bias remained for data extraction. Only 1 of these articles was a randomized clinical trial, which found significantly lower postconcert differences in thresholds and a lower proportion of threshold shifts in the group using earplugs compared with the unprotected group. In the other study, only 3 individuals wore earplugs, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The available evidence on the effectiveness of earplugs in preventing hearing damage directly after recreational music exposure is scarce. Only 1 well-conducted randomized clinical trial was found, which showed that wearing earplugs to concerts is effective in reducing postconcert threshold shifts. There is a need for further research on this topic to strengthen the level of evidence. Physicians should promote awareness on the risks of recreational noise and recommend the use of earplugs among their patients who visit music venues.Copyright 2016 American Medical Association.

AB  - Brochures containing messages developed according to the Extended Parallel Process Model were deployed to increase intentions to use hearing protection for college students. These brochures were presented to one-half of a college student sample, after which a questionnaire was administered to assess perceptions of threat, efficacy, and behavioral intentions. The other half of the sample completed the questionnaire and then received brochures. Results indicated that people receiving the brochure before the questionnaire reported greater perceptions of hearing loss threat and efficacy to use ear plugs when in loud environments, however, intentions to use ear plugs were unchanged. Distribution of the brochure also resulted in greater perceptions of hearing loss threat and efficacy to use over-the-ear headphones when using devices such as MP3 players. In this case, however, intentions to use over-the-ear headphones increased. Results are discussed in terms of future research and practical applications.

AB  - In the noisy environment, workers use hearing protectors to protect their hearing organ against adverse effects of noise. Hearing protectors should be well selected according to the spectrum and level of noise. The selection of hearing protectors is based on the sound attenuation values measured in laboratory conditions. Workers usually use hearing protectors provided by employers as long as there are no signs of any physical damage. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of use and storage as well as of atmospheric conditions on sound attenuation of ear-muffs. Four models of ear-muffs popular in the Polish work environment were tested for two years. They fulfilled the PN-EN 352-1 standard requirements and were granted a certification mark. Fifteen samples of each model were used by workers every working day; 10 samples were exposed to natural atmospheric conditions; and 10 samples were stored in accordance with the manufacture's advice. Temperature and humidity were checked each day. After periods of one and two years, sound attenuation was measured according to PN-EN 24869-1 standard. The observed changes in high-frequency attenuation value H, medium-frequency attenuation value M, low-frequency attenuation value L and single number rating calculated according to PN - EN ISO 4869-2, are presented. The quantitative assessment how far the period of use, storage and exposure to natural atmospheric conditions affect protection achieved by the four popular models of ear-muffs is presented.

AB  - This paper presents the methodology and the results of binaural measurements of exposure to noise for 91 industry workers wearing ear-muffs. The results revealed that 18.7% of the workers were exposed to noise of equivalent A-weighted sound pressure levels of over 80 dB(A) and 7.7% to levels of over 85 dB(A). The measured levels were compared with those calculated with the octave-band method according to Standard No. EN 458:2004. The differences ranged from -3 dB(A) to 26.5 dB(A); their statistical distribution did not indicate any data which could suggest derating laboratory measurements. The main causes of exposure to noise higher by over 3 dB(A) than that theoretically predicted were the bad technical condition of ear-muffs (32.2% of the cases) and an incorrect way of wearing them (15.2%).

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an important etiology of deafness worldwide. Hearing conservation programs are in place and have reduced the prevalence of NIHL, but this disorder is still far too common. Occupational and recreational pursuits expose people to loud noise and ten million persons in the US have some degree of noise-induced hearing impairment. It is estimated that 50 million in the US and 600 million people worldwide are exposed to noise hazards occupationally. Noise deafness is still an important and frequent cause of battlefield injury in the US military. A mainstay of hearing conservation programs is personal mechanical hearing protection devices which are helpful but have inherent limitations. Research has shown that oxidative stress plays an important role in noise-induced cochlear injury resulting in the discovery that a number of antioxidant and cell death inhibiting compounds can ameliorate deafness associated with acoustic trauma. This article reviews one such compound, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in terms of its efficacy in reducing hearing loss in a variety of animal models of acute acoustic trauma and hypothesizes what its therapeutic mechanisms of action might be based on the known actions of NAC. Early clinical trials with NAC are mentioned. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Noise produced by weapons may be harmful to soldiers during military service. Exposure to impulse noise during compulsory military service depends on the number of shots, explosion impulses, distance of injured ear from causal firearm as well as on the use of hearing protectors. Weapons produce impulse noises, which are characterized by peak pressure level and frequency. The purpose of this work was to calculate and estimate risk on hearing at soldiers during one year of the military service. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comparised three groups of soldiers with different kind of exposure to noise divided according total noise exposure. In order to evaluate the amount of the exposure to impulse noise the total level of noise and the spectrum analysis were performed for all types of weapons, which were used during military service. The equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level, L A eq, Te [dB], maximum A-weighted sound pressure level, L A max [dB] and C weighted peak sound pressure level, L C peak [dB] were measured. RESULT(S): The highest total exposure to noise concerned group I (2222,9 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 22212,8 kPa(2)/s for left one) with total exposure time 248,3 minutes. In the II group estimated total exposure to noise was 611,8 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 743,6 kPa(2)/s for left one. In the III group least exposed to noise, estimated total exposure to noise was 103 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 109 kPa(2)/s for left one with total time exposure 17,8 minutes. CONCLUSION(S): Difference between groups is dependent on kind of military service. Estimated exposure to weapons noise may prevent soldiers before hearing loss. We did not notice differences between sites of ears.

AB  - Objectives. Annoyance from transportation noise is well characterised but little is known about occupational noise. We investigated the relation between occupational noise exposure level, the use of hearing protection devices (HPD), and noise annoyance. Methods We studied 452 industrial workers and 68 financial workers who post shift reported noise annoyance during work on a 5-point scale. Noise exposure level was recorded every 5 seconds at the dominant shoulder for 24 hours and we calculated the LAeq value for work hours. For 342 workers who kept a HPD diary, we subtracted 10 dB from every noise recording obtained during HPD use and estimated the LAEq value at the ear. Results The mean measured noise exposure level was 80.0 dB(A) [range: 55.0-98.9] and the mean estimated level at the ear 77.8 dB(A) [range: 55.0-94.2]. Fifty-one percent of workers exposed at a measured noise level >= 85 dB(A) were annoyed (the upper 3 points on the annoyance scale) and 14% highly annoyed (the upper 2 points). In a logistic regression model that also adjusted for neuroticism, annoyance increased monotonously with 6% per dB(A) (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09). A slightly lower trend was seen per estimated LAEq level at the ear (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.99-1.07). HPD use was strongly associated with annoyance when adjusted for noise exposure level (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.9). Conclusions Increasing occupational noise exposure level was associated with increasing prevalence of annoyance but at a much lower annoyance level than seen for transportation noise. We documented no gainful effect of hearing protection, but the opposite. An obvious explanation is that noise annoyance is not solely a question of the amount of noise appearing at the ear but also other characteristics of a noisy work environment; furthermore, that HPD use is predicted by noise sensitivity and other individual characteristics that are associated with noise annoyance.

AB  - Exposure to loud sound during leisure activities for long periods of time is an important area to implement preventive health education, especially among young people. The aim was to identify the relations among awareness about the damaging effects of loud levels of sounds, previous exposures do loud sounds, preferences-related to sound levels and knowledge about hearing protection with age, gender, and their parent's educational level among children. Prospective cross-sectional. Seven hundred and forty students (5-16 years old) and 610 parents participated in the study. Chi-square test, Fisher exact test and linear regression. About 86.5% of the children consider that loud sounds damage the ears and 53.7% dislike noisy places. Children were previously exposed to parties and concerts with loud music, Mardi Gras, firecrackers and loud music at home or in the car and loud music with earphones. About 18.4% of the younger children could select the volume of the music, versus 65.3% of the older ones. Children have poor information about hearing protection and do not have hearing protection device. Knowledge about the risks related to exposures to loud sounds and about strategies to protect their hearing increases with age, but preference for loud sounds and exposures to it increases too. Gender and parents' instructional level have little influence on the studied variables. Many of the children's recreational activities are noisy. It is possible that the tendency of increasing preference for loud sounds with age might be a result of a learned behavior.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Brazilian version of the Dangerous Decibels educational program in increasing students' knowledge and positively changing their attitudes and intended behaviors related to NIHL prevention and to decrease exposures to loud sounds and the barriers related to hearing protective strategies (HPS). Design(s): This is a prospective longitudinal controlled study. Study sample: Third to fifth graders (n = 220) filled out a baseline questionnaire; participated in a 60 minutes Dangerous Decibels classroom presentation; answered a follow-up questionnaire immediately after the presentation; worked with their teachers on an activity booklet about hearing health ten weeks later; and filled out a three-months follow-up questionnaire. Students that did not receive health hearing education served as a control group (n = 51). A mixed analysis of variance was performed, with time as the within-subjects independent variable, and the intervention as the between-subjects independent variable. Result(s): The study group exhibited significant short- and long-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and intended behavior related to NIHL and acoustic trauma prevention, and in decreased exposures to loud sounds and barriers to the use of hearing protective strategies. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a Brazilian version of the Dangerous Decibels classroom program with an additional supplementary workbook intervention. © 2014 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. Prevention measures are not well established in developing countries. This comparative cross sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in both a group of high risk workers and a control group and to assess their knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. A total of 101 market mill workers and 103 controls employed within markets in the city of Accra, Ghana, were evaluated using a structured questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The questionnaire assessed factors including self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the effects of noise on hearing health and the use of hearing protective devices. Pure tone audiometric testing was conducted for both mill workers and controls. Noise levels at the work premises of the mill workers and controls were measured. Symptoms of hearing loss were reported by 24 (23.76%) and 8 (7.7%) mill workers and controls respectively. Fifty-five (54.5%) and fifty-four (52.37%) mill workers and controls exhibited knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. Five (5.0%) mill workers used hearing protective devices. There was significant sensorineural hearing loss and the presence of a 4 kHz audiometric notch among mill workers when compared with controls for the mean thresholds of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz (P = 0. 001). The prevalence of hearing loss in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively (P < 0.5). The prevalence of hearing loss, which may be characteristic of NIHL in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively. The majority of mill workers did not use hearing protection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION. Intensive Care Units (ICU) are characterized by high noise levels, caused by medical intervention and continuous use of technical equipment. On the one hand these procedures are useful to treat patients; on the other hand several studies showed that noise causes stress for the patients and needs to be avoided [1]. OBJECTIVES. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of methods on active noise reduction concerning patients' stress on ICUs. METHODS. Three settings to reduce noise imposed stress on 72 postoperative patients in ICUs were compared after approval of the study by our local ethics committee and written informed consent of recruited patients. Each patient was equipped with an MP3 player (Intenso Music Walker) combined with noise-canceling earplugs (Philips SHN2500/37) and then randomly, single-blindly assigned to one of the following groups: active noise reduction (NR), active noise reduction with sound masking (NRM), or switched off device as a control group. We gathered acoustic data and vital parameters at the same time during a overnight period of 10 h. On the environmental side, noise was measured by installing iPods (Apple iPod touch) with microphones (Sennheiser KE4) and a self-developed App (MATLAB, The MathWorks) based on the ITA-Toolbox [2]. This toolbox is capable of recording the sound level, and psychoacoustic parameters like A-scale sound level, loudness and sharpness. From recorded data the number of "loud" (respectively "very loud") events was calculated, which was defined as the 5 % (2 %) percentile of loudness values. On the patient's side, we measured both, the subjective perception by questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), State Trate Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a selfdeveloped sheet, and objective physiologic parameters like cortisol, vital parameters and skin conductance. RESULTS. The analysis exhibited no significant difference in skin conductance and cortisol level among the three groups. Both groups with active noise reduction experienced an increase of blood pressure. Depression score decreased in the NRM group (p = 0.012). Anxiety score raised in the NR group (p = 0.013). Nevertheless, most of the patients estimated the feature NRM as pleasant. CONCLUSION. Noise is a pressing subject in ICUs. It is important to train staff to avoid unnecessary noise. Technical methods to reduce noise continue to be challenging. In the future, the development of further strategies for reducing patients' stress should be encouraged, to improve patients' recovery.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify factors affecting the use of the hearing protection devices (HPDs) among workers exposed to noise using the Pender Health Promotion Model. Method(s): The 222 subjects came from thermal power plants with similar noise levels, which are between 80 dB and 90 dB in South Korea. Data were collected with self-administered questionnaires designed to measure concepts from the Health Promotion Model. Result(s): Mean percent times of using the HPDs at their most recent job site were 50.9%, and 20.3% had never the HPDs. The predictors of HPD use were social modeling (OR = 1.380), perceived benefits (OR = 1.150), and working at noisy worksites (OR = 4.925) when the outcome was based on the "non-use" versus "used at least once". However, the predictors of HPD use were social modeling (OR = 1.795) and perceived benefits (OR = 1.139) based on the "less than half-of-the-time-use" versus "more than half-of-the-time-use". Conclusion(s): Social modeling and perceived benefits of using the HPDs are important for workers to keep minimal or certain level of using the HPDs. © 2010 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

AB  - Auditory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) requires quantification of sound stimuli in the magnetic environment and adequate isolation of background noise. We report the development of two novel sound measurement systems that accurately measure the sound intensity inside the ear, which can simultaneously provide the similar or greater amount of scanner- noise protection than ear-muffs. First, we placed a 2.6x2.6-mm microphone in an insert phone that was connected to a headphone [microphone-integrated, foam-tipped insert-phone with a headphone (MIHP)]. This attenuated scanner noise by 37.8+/-4.6 dB, a level better than the reference amount obtained using earmuffs. The nonmetallic optical microphone was integrated with a headphone [optical microphone in a headphone (OMHP)] and it effectively detected the change of sound intensity caused by variable compression on the cushions of the headphone. Wearing the OMHP reduced the noise by 28.5+/-5.9 dB and did not affect echoplanar magnetic resonance images. We also performed an auditory fMRI study using the MIHP system and presented increase in the auditory cortical activation following 10-dB increment in the intensity of sound stimulation. These two newly developed sound measurement systems successfully achieved the accurate quantification of sound stimuli with maintaining the similar level of noise protection of wearing earmuffs in the auditory fMRI experiment. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A large number of soldiers returning from war report hearing loss and/or tinnitus. Many deployed soldiers decline to wear their hearing protection devices (HPDs) because they feel that earplugs interfere with their ability to detect and localize the enemy and their friends. The detection problem is easily handled in electronic devices with low-noise microphones. The localization problem is not as easy. In this paper, the factors that reduce situational awareness - hearing loss and restricted bandwidth in HPD devices - are discussed in light of available data, followed by a review of the cues to localization. Two electronic blast plug earplugs with 16-kHz bandwidth are described. Both provide subjectively transparent sound with regard to sound quality and localization, i.e., they sound almost as if nothing is in the ears, while protecting the ears from blasts. Finally, two formal experiments are described which investigated localization performance compared to popular existing military HPDs and the open ear. The tested earplugs performed well regarding maintaining situational awareness. Detection-distance and acceptance studies are underway. © 2011 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Although a great many brass players, and trumpet players in particular, successfully use high-fidelity earplugs, others report problems with their use. This article discusses factors that may discourage a brass player from using hearing protection: These include (a) a lack of acclimatization time; (b) a loss of "fortissimo blare" from the aural distortion generated by the 110- to 120-dB SPL produced at the open ear with fortissimo playing; (c) a shallow earmold seal, leading to a large occlusion effect; (d) a poor seal combined with incorrect acoustic mass in the sound channel; and (e) hearing loss where many harmonic overtones of even moderately loud playing may become inaudible with earplugs to a lifelong trumpet player with high-frequency hearing loss. The limitations imposed by each of these can usually be overcome with modifications of the hearing protection device (HPD) or with acclimatization time, allowing a lifetime of playing without the all-too-common "musicians' hearing loss" and/or tinnitus. A review of these factors helps to delineate some of the perceptual issues that musicians may have with any change in the spectrum of their instrument-whether it is related to attenuation or amplification.

AB  - Objectives: To determine Noise induced hearing loss in industrial workers in a ceramic industry with comparison to office workers working in a quite environment. Material(s) and Method(s): A comparative cross sectional study was conducted in industrial workers with comparison to office workers. Sixty workers of a ceramic industry were compared with same number of office workers. Variable like Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL), blood pressure, pulse rate and sleep were compared using chi square test. The study was conducted from February 2014 to September 2014. Result(s): Out of 60 industrial workers and 60 office workers, 43% industrial workers and 20% office workers showed significant NIHL. Blood pressure and pulse rate were significantly high among industrial workers. Sleeping hours were reduced in industrial workers. NIHL was reduced among those workers using ear plugs. Conclusion(s): Hearing loss is the major public health problem in industrial workers all over the world. Proper protective measures can prevent occupational hazards in industrial workers.Copyright © 2015, Khyber Medical College. All rights reserved.

Inducing behavioral change in young adults is one of the aims of a hearing conservation program (HCP). The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of a hearing education program after 6 months in young adults in relation to knowledge regarding their individual hearing status. The results of a questionnaire regarding the weekly equivalent recreational noise exposure, attitudes and beliefs toward noise, and hearing loss and hearing protector devices (HPDs) were compared between both sessions. Seventy-eight young adults completed the questionnaire concerning recreational noise exposure, youth attitude to noise scale (YANS), and beliefs about hearing protection and hearing loss (BAHPHL). Their hearing status was evaluated based on admittance measures, audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The main analysis consisted of a mixed model analysis of variance with dependent variables of either the noise exposure or the scores on (subscales of) YANS and BAHPHL. The independent variables were hearing status and session one versus session two. There was a significant decrease in recreational noise exposure and several (sub) scales of YANS and BAHPHL between both the sessions. This behavioral change resulted in a more frequent use of HPDs in 12% of the participants. However, the behavioral change was not completely related to the knowledge of young adults' individual hearing status. To prevent hearing damage in young people, investing in HCPs is necessary, apart from regulating sound levels and its compliance at various leisure-time activities. Also, the long-term effect of HCPs and their most cost-efficient repetition rates should be further investigated.

AB  - There is great concern regarding the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in youth caused by high sound levels during various leisure activities. Health-orientated behavior of young adults might be linked to the beliefs and attitudes toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices (HPDs). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and HPDs on young adults' hearing status. A questionnaire and an audiological test battery were completed by 163 subjects (aged 18-30 years). The questionnaire contained the Youth Attitude to Noise Scale (YANS) and Beliefs about Hearing Protection and Hearing Loss (BAHPHL). A more positive attitude or belief represented an attitude where noise or hearing loss is seen as unproblematic and attitudes and beliefs regarding HPDs is worse. Hearing was evaluated using (high frequency) pure tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. First, mean differences in hearing between the groups with different attitudes and beliefs were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Second, a chi2 test was used to examine the usage of HPDs by the different groups with different attitudes and beliefs. Young adults with a positive attitude had significantly more deteriorated hearing and used HPDs less than the other subjects. Hearing conservation programs (HCPs) for young adults should provide information and knowledge regarding noise, hearing loss, and HPDs. Barriers wearing HPDs should especially be discussed. Further, those campaigns should focus on self-experienced hearing related symptoms that might serve as triggers for attitudinal and behavioral changes.

AB  - Drop weld injuries to the tympanic membrane and middle ear caused by hot sparks or molten slag are a rare but significant injury. Steel workers and welders who are regularly exposed to flying sparks and molten metal slag are predisposed. This type of transtympanic thermal injury occurs when the slag literally drops into the external auditory canal and burns through the tympanic membrane. A spectrum of severity of injury occurs which includes chronic tympanic membrane perforation, chronic otorrhoea, facial nerve injury and deafness. Chronic tympanic membrane perforation is the most common sequelae and is perhaps one of the most challenging of all perforations to repair. The combination of direct thermal injury and foreign body reaction results in continuing or recurrent suppuration. The foreign body reaction is due to the embedding of metal slag in the promontorial mucosa. We present a case of drop weld injury to the left tympanic membrane, resulting in chronic middle ear inflammation, otorrhoea and tympanic perforation. CAT scan clearly demonstrated a metallic promontorial foreign body with localised bone erosion. We emphasise the importance of removing these foreign bodies and recommend a cartilage reinforced underlay tympanoplasty technique to repair these perforations. Transtympanic thermal trauma is a preventable occupational injury, which is best, avoided by earplugs and increased awareness.

AB  - Objectives: Chronic exposure to high levels of noise may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We therefore undertook a quantitative retrospective exposure assessment using predictive statistical modelling to estimate historical exposures to noise among a cohort of 27 499 sawmill workers as part of an investigation of acute myocardial infarction mortality. Method(s): Noise exposure data were gathered from research, industry and regulatory sources. An exposure data matrix was defined and exposure level estimated for job title/mill/time period combinations utilising regression analysis to model determinants of noise exposure. Cumulative exposure and duration of exposure metrics were calculated for each subject. These were merged with work history data, and exposure-response associations were tested in subsequent epidemiological studies, reported elsewhere. Result(s): Over 14 000 noise measurements were obtained from British Columbia sawmills. A subset, comprising 1901 full-shift dosimetry measurements from cohort mills was used in producing a predictive model (R2 = 0.51). The model was then used to estimate noise exposures for 3809 "cells" of an exposure data matrix representing 81 jobs at 14 mills over several decades. Various exposure metrics were then calculated for subjects; mean cumulative exposure was 101 dBA*year. Mean durations of employment in jobs with exposure above thresholds of 85, 90 and 95 dBA, were 9.9, 7.0 and 3.2 years, respectively. Conclusion(s): The utility of predictive statistical modelling for occupational noise exposure was demonstrated. The model required input data that were relatively easily obtained, even retrospectively. Remaining issues include adequate handling of the use of hearing protectors that likely bias exposure estimation.

AB  - Objective: It is a legal requirement for employees in noisy workplaces such as nightclubs to be provided with suitable information regarding their noise exposure risks, used a focus group approach to examine employees attitudes to workplace noise and to hearing protection use. The subsequent analysis was based on an adapted Health Belief Model. Design/Setting: A total of five focus group interviews were conducted in three nightclubs between July and October 2011. The 32 participants were employees in nightclubs that were shown to have daily noise exposures in excess of 80 dBA. Method(s): A tailor-made noise-training programme was designed using the combined Health Belief Model and Health Promotion Model as a framework. Result(s): The focus groups provided a deeper level of understanding of the barriers faced by the employees to hearing protection use and issues with management engagement. Participants were fatalistic, and although they acknowledged that exposure to noise in nightclubs could lead to hearing loss in the distant future, they felt there was very little that they could do to prevent it from happening. Conclusion(s): The focus groups offered insight into the barriers faced by the employees, especially relating to hearing protection use and management engagement. Findings from this study may be used to design sectorspecific noise awareness training content designed to address the adapted Health Belief Model constructs identified here.Copyright © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The maximum limit of MR scanner noise and necessity of ear protection is de- fined in the IEC standard (IEC60601-2-33) of MR safety. With improvements in MR scanner performance, pulse sequences generating higher scanning noise have been used clinically. In this study, we investigated the factors significantly related to potential acoustic trauma cases (PATC) after MR examinations. To consider the future direction for MR safety and prevention of acoustic trauma, issues related to noise generation by MR scanners and acoustic trauma were systematically reviewed. Method(s): A statistical analysis was performed using the data set from a survey (n=974) conducted in 2010 by the JSMRM safety committee. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to extract the characteristics of the responders. With this classification as a reference, tests of independence and a residual analysis were employed to evaluate the factors related to PATC. Result(s): No significant relationship was observed between the ear protection policy and the incidence or the reported outcome of PATC. While the two main clusters out of the six clusters extracted were associated with who reported the PATC and the confirmation process of the acoustic noise level of MR scanners, no cluster was associated with the frequency of PATC. An absence of PATC was significantly less reported (p=0.03) and more PATC was reported (p=0.04) by facilities with 3T MR systems. Discussion(s): Although the total frequency was 4 cases, it should be noted that persistent hearing disturbances are a possible consequence of MR examinations. Neither the condition of the subjects nor the ear protection method was significantly related to the probability of PATC, suggesting the difficulty of predicting the potential risk of acoustic trauma. It is recommended to more systematically follow up PATC cases and clarify the risk factors.

AB  - Rationale Sleep fragmentation and deprivation are associated with a variety of neurocognitive deficits including inattention, memory impairment, and hallucinations. In the intensive care unit (ICU), sleep is frequently disrupted due to many factors, including noise, light, medications, and patient care activities. Despite being a potentially modifiable risk factor for ICU delirium, there has been little systematic evaluation of the potential benefit of sleep-promoting interventions. Hence, we evaluated the impact of a sleep quality improvement (QI) project on delirium/coma-free days in a medical ICU (MICU). Methods This inter-disciplinary MICU sleep QI project occurred from January to July 2010 and compared delirium/coma-free days during a pre-QI baseline period and a subsequent sleep QI period. All MICU patients present for at least one full night were eligible for evaluation. This project targeted modifiable factors affecting sleep, and was implemented over 3 sequential, additive stages: 1) environmental improvements (e.g., minimizing overhead pages and dimming lights at night); 2) non-pharmacologic improvements (offering earplugs, eye masks, and soothing music at bedtime); and 3) a pharmacologic guideline promoting non-deliriogenic medications for sleep. A structured QI process was undertaken, including use of a daily checklist for MICU staff. Trained nursing staff assessed coma and delirium twice-daily using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of the QI project (QI vs. baseline periods) with patients' daily delirium/coma status, using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for within-patient clustering of repeated daily measures (i.e. delirium/coma, mechanical ventilation, and use of sedating medications). Results In the 2-month baseline and the 3-month sleep QI periods, 122 patients (634 MICU patient-days) and 178 patients (826 patient-days) were evaluated, respectively, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics (male: 56 vs. 48%; median age: 54 vs. 54). A significant difference was observed between the baseline versus QI periods in patient-days requiring mechanical ventilation (71 vs. 65%, p=0.02). Delirium/coma-free days were higher during the sleep QI period (48%) versus baseline period (43%, unadjusted p=0.04). The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for daily delirium/coma-free status for the QI vs. baseline period was 1.64 (1.04 - 2.58) (Table 1), representing a projected reduction of 456 days of delirium/coma per year for the participating MICU. Conclusion Delirium/coma-free days in a MICU can increase with implementation of a multi-faceted sleep quality improvement project. (Table Presented).

AB  - Rationale Sleep quality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients is poor, with frequent disruptions, awakenings, and arousals. Strategies to improve ICU sleep have gained recent attention in light of efforts to minimize sedation and prevent delirium, promote early mobilization, and improve long-term neurocognitive outcomes. Although some ICU sleep disruptions are related to physiologic perturbations associated with critical illness, other factors (e.g., noise, light, nurse interactions, and medications) can be improved. We describe the process of applying an existing Quality Improvement (QI) model to design a Sleep QI Initiative in the ICU setting. Methods A multi-disciplinary MICU Sleep QI team at Johns Hopkins was established and held monthly meetings for >1 year to design the initiative. Team representatives included MICU physicians, nursing and pharmacy; sleep medicine; neuropsychology; and psychiatry. The team employed an established four-step model (BMJ 2008;337:963) for QI: 1) summarizing the evidence; 2) identifying local barriers to implementation through understanding the process and context of work; 3) selecting performance measures; and 4) implementing the intervention with all stakeholders via an iterative "4 E's Model": Engaging, Educating, Executing and Evaluating. Results The MICU QI initiative was designed for implementation in 3 sequential stages which addressed important modifiable factors affecting MICU sleep quality: 1) undertaking environmental improvements, including minimizing overhead pages, turning off televisions, dimming hallway lights, and bathing patients before bedtime; 2) offering earplugs, eye masks, and soothing music at bedtime, if desired by non-delirious patients; and 3) developing and promoting a guideline for use of medications when patients were unable to sleep. A daily checklist was designed to remind staff to complete individual patient and MICU-wide interventions. The primary QI outcome is daily measurement of sleep quality using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (a measure of perceived sleep quality validated against polysomnography in ICU patients). Secondary ICU outcomes include daily delirium status (measured by CAM-ICU), ability to participate in daily physical rehabilitation therapy, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality. The QI evaluation was designed as a "pre-post" comparison of outcomes during an ad-lib baseline period versus each of the sequential QI intervention stages. Conclusion A published QI model can be used successfully to create a multi-disciplinary, collaborative team and design a multi-stage QI project aimed at improving modifiable factors affecting ICU patients' sleep quality.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - I have been given the task of talking about the toxicological assessment of herbal materials, and also its progress in India. Now, progress in India is a very big topic, but I will try to cover whatever I can and that too in terms of Toxicological Assessment. Let us begin with the question - Is the toxicity testing of traditionally used herbal medicines required? We must question this, because there is assured safety, as herbal medicines have been used in India for more than 4000 years as per documentation and earlier also. However, if these herbs are pharmacologically active they will have the potential to be toxic too, if used in a very high dose. Hence, toxicity evaluation is required for these materials also. It is a very systematic evaluation and we need to have our minds open when doing this toxicological evaluation. There are two things that have happened over the past say 25 years or maybe more in India. One is, there has been a shift from individual medication by the Vaidji to larger scale production of these herbal medicines or herbal formulations. There is also an economic aspect attached to it. We would like our country to grow and reach the bar, which is 62 billion dollars, so let us not have the share of 1.5%, we want to have a better percentage in that market. The safety evaluation of herbals would depend on two or three things; one is the purity of the preparation. If the preparation is not a standardized one, that particular individual preparation can cause toxicity. It does not mean that all such preparations are toxic. Second is, it should be free from contamination. There should not be any contaminant in the medicinal plant preparations and then a systematic toxicity evaluation is desired. The quality may be compromised due to a number of factors. One is misidentification - not many people know how to identify a medicinal plant and particularly a plant species. Then there can be adulteration, substitution because of economic reasons, because the species may be endangered, maybe cost-wise very high so substituted with another one, or not available so substituted with another one. There can be contamination, which is always inadvertent and not with any intention as such. Storage of the material and shelf life can also compromise the quality of the preparation. Quoting one study where 25 commercial Panax ginseng preparations were evaluated for seven marker compounds, they differed significantly from the ginesenosides' content on the label, that is, 15-fold in the capsules and 36-fold in the liquid preparations, which is a very high amount of variation. The question is, 'do we really have standardization?' and AYUSH took a lead in developing pharmacopeial standards, which Dr. Sharma mentioned earlier. We have been a part of this study and we have concentrated on 17 poisonous plants; altogether 24 medicinal plants were done in this and we developed the chromatographic finger print profile and also the microscopic studies to identify the plant. Seven of these monographs have already been published. We can also go in for say genomic parameters liked RAPD, RFLP, and identify of the species using that. In our laboratory, we have conducted it for Desmodium gangeticum a very important constituent of Dashamula. There can be an intrinsic toxic principle in a medicinal plant. This kind of information can come from literature and from reports, and that is why it is very important to report and document it. One example that is given here is over 100 cases of irreversible nephropathy reported in young women attending a slimming clinic, since 1993, and some developed urothelial cancer also. There was an inadvertent use of the toxic Aristolochia fangchi root in the formulation as a substitute for Stephania tetrandra. A very recent report in 2010, mentions that consumption of aristolochic acid containing Chinese herbal products (studied in 4574 patients) was found to be associated with an increased risk of cancer of the urinary tract, in a dose-dependent manner. So, if we have this kind of information and we also h ve information about aristolochic acid being present in the preparation, then we can be cautious right from the beginning. There are certain warnings that keep coming from time to time like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a consumer advisory that Kava products may be associated with severe liver injury. These types of toxic herbs may not be present in the dietary supplement or medicines, but what about topical applications. The pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Comfrey is one of the examples. Comfrey is one of the most popular herbal teas in the world, which contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and FDA took action to remove Comfrey from all dietary supplements in 2001. But you see, there are creams and cosmetics which contain this and they are being marketed. Some of the families of medicinal plants in which pyrrolizidine alkaloids are present are Boraginaceae, Asteraceae, and Fabaceae. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid has minimum toxicity, but when it is metabolized in the liver then the pyrroles formed are toxic, so it causes liver damage. Apart from liver damage it also causes damage to other organs; it can infiltrate the lung fluids, it can cause pulmonary edema, and in high doses it can be fatal. So there are the non-target toxicities also. That was about quality and intrinsic toxic principles that may be present in the medicinal plant and now coming to the contaminants; herbs should be free from contaminants. What are the contaminants that we should look for? Heavy metals, pesticides, microbial load, and radioactivity. Radioactive load may be related to the location, so one has to exercise one's own wisdom to see whether it is required to be tested or not. However, with regard to the other three, they do require testing. Heavy metal may be present as an ingredient, as in some of the ayurvedic preparations or as a contaminant. The commonly tested pesticides, synthetic pyrethroids, and organophosphates, have limited halflife, so they do not cause much of a problem but organochorines do cause a problem because they are residual in nature and persistent, and studies show that even 25 - 30 years after banning DDT in the US, the residues are present in the soil. So, the persistent nature of these pesticides requires that these should be tested. Now with this knowledge, in our country DDT is not allowed to be used for agricultural purposes, but it is used for vector control because we have a problem of malaria. Hence, we took up a systematic study of heavy metals and persistent pesticides in medicinal plants. Since 2002, taking up studies in three simultaneous projects, we have analyzed more than 1800 plant samples. You can see the map and the red dots in more than 100 locations in the country from where the samples were collected, belonging to 312 plant species, and heavy metals, volatile and non-volatile; both were tested. We tested for DDT (op' and pp'), its metabolytes, all the four isoforms of HCH and alpha endosulfan and tried to collect samples equally from each zone. If you would see, the data generated from the analysis of all the 1800 plants, for lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury (Pb, Cd, As, and Hg), then the level of heavy metals is not very high. In our study, hardly 1.5 to 2% of the plants contained lead over the permissible level. Also, different countries have different permissible limits. In Singapore the permissible limit for lead is 20 mg, whereas, in our country it is 10 mg. But now we have the directive that lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury are to be tested in all herbal raw material extracts and all the finished products. Among the persistent pesticides, most of the time they were below the detection limit, but the data that you see here is just for the detected ones; although it does not mean that if it is detected, it is above the permissible limits. As we have sophisticated equipment we can detect it at a very low level. Just a finding that some heavy metal or pesticide has been detected, does not mean that it is toxic. We have to exercise our wisdom to see what is toxic and what is not toxic. It does not have to be alarming if DDT is just detected in a number of plants. The Commerce Ministry fixed specification limits for heavy metals and pesticide residues, which came out in 2007. As we have generated a large data volume, we have developed a database for it, which has recently been copyrighted, where we have the names of the plants. It contains the plant part, it gives you information regarding the region from which it has been collected, and the date on which it has been collected, and from the data, one can generate a report according to one's own need. It will give you a picture of all the plant parts that we have analyzed. We have also analyzed the microbial load in medicinal plants as per the WHO permissible limits, bacterial count should be equivalent or less than 105 colony forming units (CFU) and fungul count should be less than 104 CFU / g crude plant material. E. coli and Salmonella must be absent in the plant material. Now coming to toxicity testing, it depends on the intended use. Here I am citing one example of garlic; it can be used as a food additive, conventional food, dietary supplement food, for special dietary needs, can be used as a biological drug or a medical device - some people use it as an ear plug and in some of the cosmetics. There are several toxicity testing guidelines available, for example, OECD, ICH, FDA, WHO, and so on, which outline the testing requirements. The minimum testing required is Acute toxicity: 14-day study, Sub-acute toxicity: 28-day study, and Chronic toxicity: 90-day study.

AB  - Hyperacusis is defined as unusual intolerance to ordinary environmental sounds, and is commonly reported in the general population and in association with a range of medical conditions. These include neurological deficits (e.g. migraine), psychiatric conditions (e.g. depression), and several ear, nose and throat diagnoses such as tinnitus, noise-induced hearing loss, and middle ear malfunctions. However, extreme sensitivity to noise has also been studied from a public health perspective, but with a focus on noise sensitivity in general. In this review a distinction is proposed between three different aspects of the experience of hyperacusis. The first is the sensitivity, with the pain sensations reported in association with sounds. The second is the annoyance, which can be unrelated to loudness, but still cause marked distress. The third aspect deals with the fear of being harmed by sounds, which promotes avoidance and the unmotivated use of ear protection. The natural course of hyperacusis is largely unknown and there are no published randomized outcome studies on the available treatment options for the condition. In this paper we propose that cognitive behavioral therapy, presented in a multidisciplinary setting, could be a useful treatment. This treatment includes relaxation methods, advice regarding sound, and gradual exposure to everyday sounds.

AB  - This paper aims to describe chronic diseases including hearing loss reported by people in a small rural community. It will present the results of audiometric screening among a group of people in this community and their self reported risk factors of hearing loss. Different risk factors experienced by men and women will be compared. Two surveys were conducted in a small Queensland rural community. The first survey gathered information relating to chronic diseases among 604 people using a telephone interview method. The second survey assessed the level of hearing among 64 people who presented themselves for audiometric screening, their history of exposure to loud noise and their previous use of hearing protective measures. A higher rate of "industrial deafness" was reported (110.75 per 1,000 population) than the 1995 National rate (95.2 per 1,000 population). Of 64 people who attended the audiometric assessment, 60 (93.8%) had some level of hearing loss using the 2000 International Standard of hearing level (ISO 7029: 2000) taking age and gender into account. However, 15 persons (23.4%) perceived that they had good hearing. When compared to ISO 7029: 2000 standard, men and women had a similar pattern of hearing loss. Compared to men, a lower percentage of women were exposed to different sources of loud noise and were less likely to use hearing protection devices.

AB  - Determine the feasibility and outcome of a pilot program to increase farm workers' use of hearing protection when performing activities with high noise exposure. The study was a quasi-experimental study. Eight intervention farmers and 17 comparison farmers participated in the study. Before and after the intervention, farmers completed a survey to identify their frequency of use of hearing protection, and their beliefs about hearing loss and use of hearing protection. The intervention consisted of noise assessments, educational sessions, mailed reminders with brochures, and placement of hearing protection on the farm. The intervention was effective in increasing the use of hearing protection 1 and 2 months after the implementation of the program. Hearing loss is a serious problem with farmers, and yet many farmers neglect to protect their hearing with the use of protection. The pilot study findings indicate that efforts to increase the use of hearing protection by farmers can be effective. © 2007, Blackwell Publishing, Inc.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant cause of morbidity among serving soldiers despite provision of a range of personal hearing protection (PHP) and education and training. It appears that soldiers are choosing to forego PHP. This audit aimed to evaluate the effect of health promotion activity on the use of hearing protection in hostile territory., METHOD: 46 dismounted infantry soldiers operating out of a forward operating base in Afghanistan during Op HERRICK 17 were directly observed in order to determine the rate of wearing PHP before and after health promotion activity., RESULTS: In the initial phase, 39% of soldiers (range 16-74%) wore PHP in at least one ear, but following health promotion activity the rate fell to 12% (range 9-14%)., CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the wearing of PHP appears to have been because the perceived diminished threat of enemy contact was outweighed by any benefit of health promotion activity. Reasons for poor compliance were not investigated, but it appears that behavioural factors, and specifically, leadership at the smallest unit level, are important. These should be investigated and considered in the development of future PHP.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical care patients experience deranged sleep for a number of reasons including noise, environment, severity of illness and care activities. This service evaluation was prompted by the concern that patients were not getting enough sleep because of excessive noise levels in our unit., AIM: To determine self-reported sleep experiences and perceived factors affecting sleep quality among intensive care patients before and after the introduction of earplugs and eye masks., DESIGN: A pre/post intervention service evaluation (n = 100) was completed to evaluate the efficacy of eye masks and earplugs in critical care patients., METHODS: Participants (n = 100) were recruited from one large critical care unit. During August 2008 to January 2009, 50 patients were recruited and received standard care. A further 50 were recruited between May and October 2009. This group was given eye masks and earplugs to aid their sleep on the critical care unit. A data collection tool was devised comprising three elements: (1) collection of demographic data from hospital charts and medical notes, (2) rating quality and quantity of sleep using two likert scales and (3) a four-item data collection sheet was used comprising of one closed and three open-ended questions., RESULTS: Noise was identified as a significant factor preventing sleep in the pre-intervention (50%) and intervention (52%) group. The pre-intervention group identified medication (26%) (i.e. night sedation or analgesia) and 'simply nothing' (24%) as factors promoting sleep., CONCLUSION: The intervention group identified earplugs (22%) and eye masks (28%) as factors promoting sleep. It appears that simple interventions such as eye masks and earplugs may be a valuable addition to patients attempting to sleep in a critical care unit., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Earplugs and eye masks are a useful adjunct to strategies promoting sleep in critical care areas.Copyright © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: The neural dys-synchrony associated with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) causes a temporal impairment that could degrade spatial hearing, particularly sound localization accuracy (SLA) and spatial release from masking (SRM). Unilateral cochlear implantation has become an accepted treatment for ANSD but treatment options for the contralateral ear remain controversial. We report spatial hearing measures in a child with ANSD before and after receiving a second cochlear implant (CI). Study sample: An 11-year-7-month old boy with ANSD and expressive and receptive language delay received a second CI eight years after his first implant. Design(s): The SLA and SRM were measured four months before sequential bilateral CIs (with the contralateral ear plugged and unplugged), and after nine months using both CIs. Result(s): Testing done before the second CI, with the first CI alone, suggested that residual hearing in the contralateral ear contributed to sound localization accuracy, but not word recognition in quiet or noise. Nine-months after receiving a second CI, SLA improved by 12.76degree and SRM increased to 3.8-4.2 dB relative to pre-operative performance. Results were compared to published outcomes for children with bilateral CIs. Conclusion(s): The addition of a second CI in this child with ANSD improved spatial hearing. © 2013 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hearing impairment from noise exposure has been reported in fix-wing pilots, especially in civilized countries. However, there are few studies on rotary wing aviators and aircraft mechanics, especially in developing countries whose hearing conservative program is not well established. The present study, therefore, was done to evaluate the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss and the contributing factors that may effect both groups of noise-exposed population. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Report questionnaires were reviewed and physical examination combined with audiometric records of 34 pilots and 42 mechanics in the Royal Thai Army Aviation Center, Lobburi, were examined. Hearing loss was studied using four categories of significant threshold shift (STS). Amplitude of noise radiated by aircraft was also measured at different distances. RESULT(S): No significant difference was found in prevalence of hearing loss in aviators (32.4%) and aircraft mechanics (47.6%), but in the aircraft mechanics group there were more damage of frequency involvement including speech frequency and high frequency and more decibels loss than aviators. The type of hearing protection and smoking index were strongly correlated with hearing loss. Age, flight time and alcohol habit had no significant effect and ninety percent of the subjects had no self awareness of hearing loss. CONCLUSION(S): Aircraft mechanics had more severity on hearing loss than aviators. Types of noise protector and cigarette smoking had significant association with hearing loss.

AB  - Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible but preventable disorder. As population lives longer and industrialization spreads, NIHL adds substantially to the global burden of disability. Even though the disease reaches endemic proportions in industrial areas like Kishangarh (Ajmer district, Rajasthan), studies to show its prevalence are relatively scarce which forms the basis of our objective. The study was planned to observe the impact of noise on hearing acuity of marble factory workers and its association with age and length of noise exposure. Following the written informed consent, 30 marble factory workers; age group 20-40 years with daily sound exposure of 8hrs/day for at least 5-10 years were included. Subjects were first examined otoscopically to rule out any external/middle ear disease followed by audiometry. The data was analysed using ANOVA and Chi-square test. The study revealed, 46.7% had noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) congruent with the audiogram. Hearing impairment significantly increased with age [p=0.019] and duration of exposure to occupational noise [p=0.000].Since the prevalence is relatively high, annual check-ups and use of personal protective equipments like earmuffs and plugs should be made mandatory.Copyright © 2017, Association of Physiologists and Pharmacologists of India.

AB  - Background : Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible but preventable disorder. As population lives longer and industrialization spreads, NIHL adds substantially to the global burden of disability. Even though disease reaches endemic proportions in industrial areas like Kishangarh (District Ajmer, Rajasthan), studies to show its prevalence are relatively scarce which forms the basis of our study. Objective : To study impact of Noise on Hearing Acuity of Marble Factory Workers and its association with age and length of exposure. Material and Methods : Our study was performed at J.L.N. Medical College Ajmer, in the months of August and September 2015. Thirty marble factory workers; age group 20-40 years with daily sound exposure of 8hrs/day for at least 5-10 years were selected. After obtaining the clearance from institutional ethical committee and informed consent, the subjects were first examined otoscopically to rule out any external/middle ear disease followed by audiometry by acoustic enclosure manufactured by Interacoustics, Model AC40. The data was analysed using ANOVA and Chi-square test. Results : The study revealed, 46.7% of 30 workers had hearing loss consistent with noise-induced audiogram (NIHL). Hearing impairment significantly increased with age [p =0.019] and duration of exposure to occupational noise [p =0.000]. Conclusion : Since the prevalence is relatively high (46.7%), annual check-ups and use of personal protective equipments like earmuffs and plugs should be made mandatory in these settings.

AB  - Purpose of review: This review will discuss the real-world risk factors involved in noise-induced hearing loss as a result of common and popular recreational activities prone to mid and high levels of noise exposure. Although there are currently no interventional measures available to reverse or mitigate preexisting hearing loss from noise, we discuss the vital importance of hearing loss prevention from noise exposure avoidance and reduction. Recent findings: Despite a seeming understanding of the effects of noise exposure from various recreational activities and devices, a large percentage of the general public who is at risk of such noise-induced hearing loss still chooses to refrain from using hearing protection instruments. Summary: While occupational exposures pose the greatest traditional risk to hearing conservation in selected workers, recreational risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss may be more insidious in overall effect given the indifferent attitude of much of the general public and particularly our youths toward hearing protection during recreational activities. Active counseling regarding the consequences of excessive noise exposure and the potential benefits to hearing from usage of hearing protection instruments is critical to providing best possible care in the hearing health professions.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Noise-induced hearing loss is a preventive disease and yet the effective treatment modality has not been established. Acute acoustic traumas caused by an exposure to gunshot noise are common in young South Korean males in military service. Considering the significant lack of awareness on this serious issue as well as the absence of proper protective gear, an in-depth analysis is desperately needed. Method(s): All 3,650 soldiers performed regular periodic gunfire exercise without any hearing protective measures. Seven patients with hearing impairment after periodic gunfire visited the aeromedical squadron; all were right-handed males. Six were tested with the K-2 rifle and one was tested with a K-5 revolver. History taking, physical examination, pure-tone audiometry, and impedance audiometry were conducted. In the next periodic gunfire exercise, all 3,650 soldiers performed gunfire with unilateral hearing protection. Result(s): The average outcome of postexposure air conduction thresholds was 6.5 dB in the right ear and 33.1 dB in the left ear. After medical treatment, hearing impairment was much improved; however, tinnitus was not diminished. In the next periodic gunfire exercise, the result of a supplement of unilateral earplug protection proved its effectiveness on acoustic trauma caused by gunfire noise. Conclusion(s): Asymmetry in hearing loss is related to the position of the head during gunfire. A unilateral hearing protection device was enough to protect hearing from gunfire noise. At the same time, it can effectively prevent a potential firearm accident that can be caused by trainees mishearing the instruction of a firearm instructor if both earplugs are worn. Thus, providing a unilateral earplug for protection against acoustic trauma must be taken into serious consideration. Copyright © by Association of Military Surgeons of U.S., 2006.

AB  - Hearing loss is an increasingly common problem in the UK, and noise-induced hearing loss is the second most common acquired cause. There is a greater burden on the younger population, as recreational noise exposure is an important contributor. New damaging hearing behaviours have emerged including loud music exposure at concerts, nightclubs and via personal music players. The mechanism of damage is thought to involve many diverse pathways, which include oxidative damage, mechanical shearing forces and glutamate excitotoxicity. Although no current treatment exists to reverse the damage caused, these pathways can be targeted by agents that are being trialled for use in post-exposure treatment and prevention, with conflicting results. Other preventative strategies are important in addressing damaging hearing behaviours, including 'safe listening' promotion with advocacy materials for young adults, and promoting safe listening devices.

AB  - Despite a high level of sound exposure and a fairly large selection of earplugs available, musicians have often been reported to use personal hearing protectors only seldom. For better hearing conservation, it is important to identify and eliminate the causes for the low motivation to use hearing protection. We explored the usage rate of custom-molded musician's earplugs (ER-15) among 15 symphony orchestra musicians with a questionnaire, and measured the attenuation properties of their earplugs with a Real-Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) procedure in a sound field. Earplug use was found to be low, and the musicians reported that earplugs hampered listening to their own and their colleagues' playing; earplugs affected either timbre or dynamics, or both. Additionally, several reasons related to discomfort of use were itemized, but the musicians who consistently used their earplugs did so in spite of problems with use. The REAT values obtained in sound field were relatively close to the manufacturer's nominal specifications, being 13.7 dB, on average. In the frequency range studied (0.125-8 kHz), individual variation in REAT was, however, up to 15 dB across the measured frequencies. Fluctuation in attenuation might be related to low use of hearing protectors, and REAT measured at fixed center frequencies may be too robust a method to uncover it. We therefore tested 10 additional subjects to find out whether a sweeping signal used in Bikisy audiometry would bring more detailed information on earplug attenuation. Mean attenuation was found to be somewhat closer to the nominal attenuation of the ER-9 and ER-15 earplugs up to about 1 kHz, whereas REAT measurements in sound field revealed more even attenuation at frequencies between 1 and 6 kHz. No significant association was found between earplug attenuation properties and earplug use. It was concluded that support and determination to get accustomed to hearing protector use are important factors in hearing conservation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the usage and knowledge of safe limits on personal listening devices (PLD) among college students., DESIGN: First, information on health history was collected. Second, microphone in real ear techniques determined eardrum to free-field correction factors. Third, hearing levels were evaluated and information gathered about knowledge of safe listening behaviors., STUDY SAMPLE: 180 college students participated in a one-hour session using their PLDs and earphones set to their personal preference., RESULTS: Virtually all participants reported knowledge of hearing loss risk due to PLD use and accurately recognized their own PLD listening levels (p = .01) as either within or exceeding safe sound limits. Forty-four subjects listened at greater than 80-dBA free-field equivalent levels. Only 7% of these participants were aware of these hazardous levels and 15% of participants' exposure surpassed free-field equivalent levels normalized to eight hours., CONCLUSIONS: Despite reported knowledge of hearing loss risk due to PLD use in virtually all college students, 1 in 4 were found to listen to their PLDs at free-field equivalent levels greater than 80-dBA, with 94% unaware of their potential risk. Further research is needed to provide accurate PLD listening information and evaluate the possibility of long term PLD intensities that surpass recommended safety levels on hearing loss in adults over time.

AB  - The purposes of the study were to investigate children's knowledge about hearing conservation, the types of protective behaviors they would adopt in noise, the agreement between children's knowledge and intended behaviors in hearing protection, and reasons why they would not take any protective action in noise. A questionnaire was administered to 479 fourth and fifth graders in their school classrooms. Results indicated that children scored low (62.0%) on this hearing conservation questionnaire. They scored the highest in strategies of hearing protection (69.9%), followed by their knowledge in general hearing health (62.6%) and noise hazards (49.6%). Only 55% of children knew that hearing protective devices could protect them against noise. Approximately 28% of children did not intend to adopt any protective behavior in noise and the major reason for this was lack of knowledge. Children's knowledge and their noise protective behavior were correlated ( P <.05). However, possessing knowledge did not guarantee that children would adopt such behaviors when they were exposed to loud sounds. It is important to increase children's knowledge about hearing protection and hazardous noise as well as to encourage actual protective actions.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep deprivation is common in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Noise and light in the ICU and the reduction in plasma melatonin play the essential roles. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of simulated ICU noise and light on nocturnal sleep quality, and compare the effectiveness of melatonin and earplugs and eye masks on sleep quality in these conditions in healthy subjects. Method(s): This study was conducted in two parts. In part one, 40 healthy subjects slept under baseline night and simulated ICU noise and light (NL) by a cross-over design. In part two, 40 subjects were randomly assigned to four groups: NL, NL plus placebo (NLP), NL plus use of earplugs and eye masks (NLEE) and NL plus melatonin (NLM). 1 mg of oral melatonin or placebo was administered at 21:00 on four consecutive days in NLM and NLP. Earplugs and eye masks were made available in NLEE. The objective sleep quality was measured by polysomnography. Serum was analyzed for melatonin levels. Subjects rated their perceived sleep quality and anxiety levels. Result(s): Subjects had shorter total sleep time (TST) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, longer sleep onset latency, more light sleep and awakening, poorer subjective sleep quality, higher anxiety level and lower serum melatonin level in NL night (P <0.05). NLEE had less awakenings and shorter sleep onset latency (P <0.05). NLM had longer TST and REM and shorter sleep onset latency (P <0.05). Compared with NLEE, NLM had fewer awakenings (P = 0.004). Both NLM and NLEE improved perceived sleep quality and anxiety level (P = 0.000), and NLM showed better than NLEE in perceived sleep quality (P = 0.01). Compared to baseline night, the serum melatonin levels were lower in NL night at every time point, and the average maximal serum melatonin concentration in NLM group was significantly greater than other groups (P <0.001). Conclusion(s): Compared with earplugs and eye masks, melatonin improves sleep quality and serum melatonin levels better in healthy subjects exposed to simulated ICU noise and light.

AB  - Purpose/Objective(s): We assessed image performance of the first commercial MRI-guided radiation therapy system. The on-board imaging unit for the system is a 0.35 Tesla MRI scanner. The goal of this study was to characterize the performance of this on-board imaging unit. Materials/Methods: We evaluated the image performance of an MRIguided radiation therapy system. The spatial integrity test was performed using an in-house developed 3D rectangular geometric accuracy phantom. Both MRI and CT images of the phantom were acquired. Control point locations determined using MR images were compared to those determined using CT images to evaluate geometric distortion. The ACR phantom tests were performed based on the procedures documented in the ACR manual. The SNR and uniformity tests were performed according to NEMA Standards MS 1-2008, MS 3-2008, MS 6-2008 and MS 9-2008. The acoustic noise was measured according to NEMA standards MS 4- 2010. The RF calibration and RF phase stability tests were performed according to procedures recommended by AAPM report No. 34. Result(s): The geometric distortion for all control points was less than 1 mm within the DSV (diameter of spherical volume) of 200 mm and less than 2 mm within the DSV of 350 mm. For planning images, typical geometric distortion was approximately 0.2 mm and 0.6 mm for DSVof 200 mm and 350 mm, respectively. For tracking images, typical geometric distortion was around 0.1 mm for both DSV of 200 mm and 350 mm. All ACR phantom imaging tests passed. More specifically, the average deviation from the prescribed slice thickness was 0.62 mm, the average deviation from the prescribed slice position was 1.64 mm, high contrast spatial resolution was 0.9 mm, and the low contrast detectability test resolved 19 spokes for T2 weighted images and 13 spokes for T1 weighted images. In SNR and uniformity test, the maximum absolute SNR deviation from the mean of all SNR values was 1.62%, 6.98% and 7.22% for the body coil, combined torso coil and combined head/neck coil, respectively, which were all within the specification. In the acoustic noise test, the noise of the loudest sequence at the loudest spot inside the patient bore was 120.2 dB (average) and 123.6 dB (peak). Therefore, hearing protectors are required to bring the noise level down to 99 dB. In the RF (radiofrequency) calibration test, the plot of the signal intensity versus flip angle shows a sinusoidal pattern with the highest signal occurring at the 90degree flip angle. In the RF phase stability test, time that FID (free induction decay) first crosses the time axis had a stability of less than 2% for both real and imaginary channels. Conclusion(s): The on-board 0.35 Tesla MRI imaging system exhibits satisfactory performance that meets well-established national recommendations.

AB  - Introduction: Environmental stimulus, especially noise and light, is thought to disrupt sleep in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to determine the physiological and psychological effects of ICU noise and light, and of earplugs and eye masks, used in these conditions in healthy subjects. Method(s): Fourteen subjects underwent polysomnography under four conditions: adaptation, baseline, exposure to recorded ICU noise and light (NL), and NL plus use of earplugs and eye masks (NLEE). Urine was analyzed for melatonin and cortisol levels. Subjects rated their perceived sleep quality, anxiety levels and perception of environmental stimuli. Result(s): Subjects had poorer perceived sleep quality, more light sleep, longer rapid eye movement (REM) latency, less REM sleep when exposed to simulated ICU noise and light (P < 0.05). Nocturnal melatonin (P = 0.007) and cortisol secretion levels (P = 0.004) differed significantly by condition but anxiety levels did not (P = 0.06). Use of earplugs and eye masks resulted in more REM time, shorter REM latency, less arousal (P < 0.05) and elevated melatonin levels (P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): Earplugs and eye masks promote sleep and hormone balance in healthy subjects exposed to simulated ICU noise and light, making their promotion in ICU patients reasonable. © 2010 Hu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) environmental factors such as noise and light have been cited as important causes of sleep deprivation in critically ill patients. Previous studies indicated that using earplugs and eye masks can improve REM sleep in healthy subjects in simulated ICU environment, and improve sleep quality in ICU patients. This study aimed to determine the effects of using earplugs and eye masks with relaxing background music on sleep, melatonin and cortisol levels in ICU patients. Method(s): Fifty patients who underwent a scheduled cardiac surgery and were expected to stay at least 2 nights in Cardiac Surgical ICU (CSICU) were included. They were randomized to sleep with or without earplugs and eye masks combined with 30-minute relaxing music during the postoperative nights in CSICU. Urine was analyzed for nocturnal melatonin and cortisol levels. Subjective sleep quality was evaluated using the Chinese version of Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (a visual analog scale, ranging 0-100). Result(s): Data from 45 patients (20 in intervention group, 25 in control group) were analyzed. Significant differences were found between groups in depth of sleep, falling asleep, awakenings, falling asleep again after awakening and overall sleep quality (P < 0.05). Perceived sleep quality was better in the intervention group. No group differences were found in urinary melatonin levels and cortisol levels for the night before surgery, and the first and second nights post-surgery (P > 0.05). The urinary melatonin levels of the first and second postoperative nights were significantly lower than those of the night before surgery (P = 0.01). The opposite pattern was seen with urinary cortisol levels (P = 0.00). Conclusion(s): This combination of non-pharmacological interventions is useful for promoting sleep in ICU adult patients; however, any influence on nocturnal melatonin levels and cortisol level may have been masked by several factors such as the timing of surgery, medication use and individual differences. Larger scale studies would be needed to examine the potential influences of these factors on biological markers and intervention efficacy on sleep.

AB  - Background: Adults in intensive care units (ICUs) often suffer from a lack of sleep or frequent sleep disruptions. Non-pharmacological interventions can improve the duration and quality of sleep and decrease the risk of sleep disturbance, delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the length of stay in the ICU. However, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness and harms of different non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in adults admitted to the ICU. Objective(s): To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critically ill adults in the ICU. To establish whether non-pharmacological interventions are safe and clinically effective in improving sleep quality and reducing length of ICU stay in critically ill adults. To establish whether non-pharmacological interventions are cost effective. Search Method(s): We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (OVID, 1950 to June 2014), EMBASE (1966 to June 2014), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to June 2014), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1956 to June 2014), CAM on PubMed (1966 to June 2014), Alt HealthWatch (1997 to June 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to June 2014), the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc, 1979 to June 2014), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI Database, 1999 to June 2014). We also searched the following repositories and registries to June 2014: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (ISRCTN Register) (www.controlled-trials.com), the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn), the Clinical Trials Registry-India (www.ctri.nic.in), the Grey Literature Report from the New York Academy of Medicine Library (www.greylit.org), OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform (www.who.int/trialsearch). We handsearched critical care journals and reference lists and contacted relevant experts to identify relevant unpublished data. Selection Criteria: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that evaluated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critically ill adults (aged 18 years and older) during admission to critical care units or ICUs. Data Collection and Analysis: Two authors independently screened the search results and assessed the risk of bias in selected trials. One author extracted the data and a second checked the data for accuracy and completeness. Where possible, we combined results in meta-analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We used post-test scores in this review. Main Result(s): We included 30 trials, with a total of 1569 participants, in this review. We included trials of ventilator mode or type, earplugs or eye masks or both, massage, relaxation interventions, foot baths, music interventions, nursing interventions, valerian acupressure, aromatherapy, and sound masking. Outcomes included objective sleep outcomes, subjective sleep quality and quantity, risk of delirium, participant satisfaction, length of ICU stay, and adverse events. Clinical heterogeneity (e.g., participant population, outcomes measured) and research design limited quantitative synthesis, and only a small number of studies were available for most interventions. The quality of the evidence for an effect of non-pharmacological interventions on any of the outcomes examined was generally low or very low. Only three trials, all of earplugs or eye masks or both, provided data suitable for two separate meta-analyses. These meta-analyses, each of two studies, showed a lower incidence of delirium during ICU stay (risk ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.80, P value = 0.002, two studies, 177 participants) and a positive effect of earplu s or eye masks or both on total sleep time (mean difference 2.19 hours, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.96, P value = 0.02, two studies, 116 participants); we rated the quality of the evidence for both of these results as low. There was also some low quality evidence that music (350 participants; four studies) may improve subjective sleep quality and quantity, but we could not pool the data. Similarly, there was some evidence that relaxation techniques, foot massage, acupressure, nursing or social intervention, and sound masking can provide small improvements in various subjective measures of sleep quality and quantity, but the quality of the evidence was low. The effects of non-pharmacological interventions on objective sleep outcomes were inconsistent across 16 studies (we rated the quality of the evidence as very low): the majority of studies relating to the use of earplugs and eye masks found no benefit; results from six trials of ventilator modes suggested that certain ventilator settings might offer benefits over others, although the results of the individual trials did not always agree with each other. Only one study measured length of stay in the ICU and found no significant effect of earplugs plus eye masks. No studies examined the effect of any non-pharmacological intervention on mortality, risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, or cost-effectiveness; the included studies did not clearly report adverse effects, although there was very low quality evidence that ventilator mode influenced the incidence of central apnoeas and patient-ventilator asynchronies. Authors' conclusions: The quality of existing evidence relating to the use of non-pharmacological interventions for promoting sleep in adults in the ICU was low or very low. We found some evidence that the use of earplugs or eye masks or both may have beneficial effects on sleep and the incidence of delirium in this population, although the quality of the evidence was low. Further high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base.Copyright © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - Hearing protection is very important for workers in noisy work environments, although the willingness of workers to wear hearing protectors depends heavily on their comfort. This paper evaluates and recommends improvements for the comfort of hearing protection. Workers' experience and comfort needs for hearing protection were investigated through a questionnaire that established the "comfort indices" for hearing protection. An earmuff "comfort tester" was designed to measure the comfort indices, and an experiment was conducted to measure workers' perceived comfort into quantitative data. From the data, the range of these comfort indices in which workers will feel comfortable was determined. Finally, guidelines to improve the design of current hearing protection based on these "comfort indices" are proposed, which may help increase workers' willingness to wear hearing protection. Relevance to industry Using these proposed guidelines may help improve the comfort of hearing protection and increase workers' willingness to wear hearing protection in noisy work environments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To explore the possible determinants of bilateral audiometric notches in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Study Design: Prospectively enrolled cohort with cross-sectional analysis. Method(s): Male workers (n = 412) with exposure to continuous loud noise (noise exposure level normalized to a nominal 8-hour working day >75 dBA) during work were included in this cohort study. The relationship between the presence of bilateral audiometric notches and age, noise exposure duration, noise exposure level, and shift from the predicted thresholds over different frequencies were determined by regression model analysis, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and area under the curve analysis. Result(s): The presence of bilateral audiometric notches was closely associated with the shifts from the predicted thresholds over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz. The shift pattern was somewhat different between those who used hearing protection devices and those who did not. The shifts from the predicted thresholds demonstrated a stronger association with bilateral audiometric notches than did age, gender, noise exposure level, or noise exposure duration. Conclusion(s): The bilateral audiometric notches in NIHL could not be determined only on the basis of age, gender, noise exposure level, or noise exposure duration. The importance of other factors associated with bilateral audiometric notches should be recognized. Elucidation of the factors of formation of bilateral audiometric notches would help us to develop a more comprehensive protection strategy to prevent further NIHL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our focus in this study was the assessment of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) in a large group of rock musicians. A further objective was to analyse tinnitus among rock musicians as related to TEOAEs., DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random. A control group was included at random for comparison., STUDY SAMPLE: We recruited 111 musicians and a control group of 40 non-musicians. Testing was conducted by using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, TEOAEs and a questionnaire., RESULTS: TEOAE SNR in the half-octave frequency band centred on 4kHz was significantly lower bilaterally in musicians than controls. This effect was strongly predicted by age and pure-tone hearing threshold levels in the 3-6kHz range. Bilateral hearing thresholds were significantly higher at 6kHz in musicians. Twenty percent of the musicians had permanent tinnitus. There was no association between the TEOAE parameters and permanent tinnitus., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an incipient hearing loss at 6kHz in rock musicians. Loss of TEOAE SNR in the 4kHz half-octave frequency band was observed, but it was related to higher mean 3-6kHz hearing thresholds and age. A large proportion of rock musicians have permanent tinnitus.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a controlled unilateral reduction in auditory acuity at the higher audiometric frequencies would have an effect on the variability in responses obtained on a task designed to measure the precedence effect. Design(s): The experiment was conducted with participants located in a large sound proof, anechoic room, and psychophysical tests were conducted with long-duration noise burst stimuli. Reduction in auditory acuity was created by inserting a specially designed earplug in the ear of participants with normal hearing. The earplugs produced a highly reliable increase in the thresholds for detecting high-frequency sounds in the blocked ear with the largest effect at the highest frequencies (4 and 8 kHz). Across-participant variability in tone-detection threshold was less than +/-5 dB. The measurement of lag-burst thresholds with and without the insertion of earplugs was used to characterize the precedence effect. The lag-burst threshold was defined as the shortest lag-burst delay that yielded a perception of two different noise bursts. Result(s): Although performance was stable across participants in the condition without the earplug, a substantial increase in variability in the lag-burst thresholds was found in the earplug condition. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that a uniform unilateral degradation in auditory acuity leads to increased variability in performance on tasks measuring fusion in the precedence effect. The outcome suggests that variable perception of the precedence effect by individuals with clinically diagnosed hearing loss might be due to factors other than a reduction in auditory acuity per se.

AB  - Noise exposure of firefighters results in increased risk of hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can be prevented by the consistent use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). However, little is known about firefighters' perceptions and attitudes on NIHL and HPD use. The purposes of the study were (1) to identify common noise sources of fire fighting equipment and activities; and (2) to describe the attitudes and beliefs of firefighters concerning the importance of their hearing, occupational noise exposure, NIHL, and HPD use. A nonexperimental, descriptive focus group design was used to gather qualitative data from firefighters at two fire houses in southeast Michigan. The study identified sources of noise unique to fire fighting, such as driving fire/emergency trucks with sirens on; operating water pumps, saws, and other equipment; and shouting to communicate with civilians and fellow firefighters. Firefighters acknowledged the significance of good hearing in fire fighting service but perceived NIHL was unavoidable on the job and viewed it as a small risk compared with other hazards. HPDs were not used regularly because firefighters believed they interfered with the ability to hear commands during emergency conditions, interfered with other required safety equipment, and were generally forgotten when gearing up. Firefighters recognized the importance of hearing health and the benefit of a hearing conservation program, including annual training, and identified several topics that should be included in a training program. These findings will provide critical information in planning what type of program should be developed and carried out for the fire fighting population.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to determine whether there are ethnic differences in predictors of hearing protection behavior between Black and White workers. The Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM) derived from Pender's Health Promotion Model (Pender, 1987) was used as a conceptual model. A total of 2,119 (297 Blacks, 1,822 Whites) were included in the analysis. Internal consistency of instrument items was assessed using theta reliability estimates. Significant predictors of the use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) for Black and White workers and differences in predictors between the two groups were examined using multiple regression with interaction terms. Ethnic differences in scale or individual item scores were assessed using chi-square and t-test analyses. Different factors influenced hearing protection behavior among Black and White workers. The model was much less predictive of Blacks' hearing protection behavior than Whites' (R2 = .12 vs. .36). Since the PUHPM was not as effective in predicting hearing protection behavior for Blacks as for Whites, future studies are needed to expand the PUHPM through qualitative study and to develop culturally appropriate models to identify factors that better predict hearing protection behavior as a basis for developing effective interventions.

AB  - CONCLUSION: Interactive multimedia computer technology using the Internet was a feasible mode of delivery for a hearing protection intervention among firefighters. Participants' favorable feedback strongly supports the continued utilization of this approach for designing and developing interventions to promote healthy behaviors., BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant occupational injury for firefighters exposed to intermittent noise on the job. It is important to educate firefighters about using hearing protection devices whenever they are exposed to loud noise. Computer technology is a relatively new health education approach and can be useful for tailoring specific aspects of behavioral change training. The purpose of this study is to present the development process of an Internet-based tailored intervention program and to assess its efficacy., METHOD: The intervention programs were implemented for 372 firefighters (mean age = 44 years, Caucasian = 82%, male = 95%) in three states (California, Illinois, and Indiana). The efficacy was assessed from firefighters' feedback through an Internet-based survey., RESULTS: A multimedia Internet-based training program was developed through (a) determining program content and writing scripts, (b) developing decision-making algorithms for tailoring, (c) graphic design and audio and video productions, (d) creating computer software and a database, and (e) postproduction quality control and pilot testing. Participant feedback regarding the training has been very positive. Participants reported that they liked completing the training via computer (83%) and also that the Internet-based training program was well organized (97%), easy to use (97%), and effective (98%) and held their interest (79%). Almost all (95%) would recommend this Internet training program to other firefighters.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) among career firefighters. Method(s): A Web-based survey and a standard audiometric test were performed with 425 firefighters from three states in the United States. Result(s): More than 40% showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive frequencies (4 and 6 kHz). The left ear showed significantly poorer hearing than the right ear. Firefighters having longer years of work in fire services demonstrated significantly worse hearing. Reported use of HPDs was 34% of the time that was needed. Firefighters who used HPDs less were significantly more likely to have hearing loss. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated a considerable NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in firefighters. More comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be implemented to reduce NIHL for firefighters. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major occupational health problem that can be prevented through the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs)., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to identify significant factors related to firefighters' use of HPDs., METHODS: A total of 404 firefighters from 35 fire departments in multiple states in the United States participated in an Internet-based survey from March 2010 to May 2011., RESULTS: Pearson correlations and multiple regression analysis suggested that several modifying and cognitive-perceptual factors were significantly related to HPD use, including noise exposure, interpersonal influences, organizational support, perceived barriers to HPD use, and perceived susceptibility to hearing loss. The multiple regression model explained 56% (R(2)=.56, adjusted R(2)=.54) of the variance in firefighters' use of HPDs (F(13, 372)=35.65, p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on incorporating these significant predictors into effective behavioral interventions designed to promote the use of HPDs in this population.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus and assess the relationship between tinnitus and hearing loss among firefighters and operating engineers, who are exposed to noise on-the-job. The study analyzed existing data from two different populations (154 firefighters and 769 operating engineers) who completed a survey and audiometric tests as part of a hearing loss prevention intervention study. Approximately 40% of both groups reported tinnitus; 34% of firefighters and 59% of operating engineers showed hearing loss at noise-sensitive frequencies (4 kHz and 6 kHz). Firefighters with high frequency hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] = 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.05, 5.11]) and those with perceived impaired hearing status (OR = 3.53; 95% CI = [1.27, 9.80]) were significantly more likely to report tinnitus. Similarly, operating engineers who had hearing loss at both low (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = [1.40, 3.15]) and high frequencies (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = [1.37, 2.90]), and perceived impaired hearing status (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = [1.55, 3.05]) were twice as likely to report tinnitus. This study demonstrated that tinnitus is a considerable problem for noise-exposed workers. Workers with hearing loss demonstrated significantly higher rates of tinnitus. Comprehensive workplace hearing conservation programs should include tinnitus management for noise-exposed workers, along with other key elements such as noise control and hearing protection.

AB  - Objective: To determine stages of hearing-protection behavioral change and their relationships with cognitions and hearing status. Method(s): A cross-sectional study of 769 construction workers who completed a survey and audiometric tests. Result(s): The majority of participants (over 64%) were in the preparation stage. Participants in the action/maintenance stage demonstrated significantly greater benefits, selfefficacy, and interpersonal influence; fewer barriers; and better hearing. This is the first study that shows significantly better health outcome, hearing ability, as the stage progresses. Conclusion(s): Study demonstrates preliminary validity of the stages of change with hearing-protection behavior. Future hearing-protection intervention should integrate the stages of change to increase effectiveness. Copyright (c) PNG Publications.

AB  - Background: Booster interventions may be useful in promoting workers' hearing protection device (HPD) use. Previous research on the effectiveness and the optimal timeframe for boosters is limited and inconsistent. Method(s): In this randomized controlled trial, 403 workers were assigned to receive an individually tailored booster, a control booster, or no booster. The booster intervention groups were further divided by timeframe. Frequency of HPD use was measured 12 months post-intervention. Result(s): The booster intervention groups significantly accounted for the variance in HPD use in Year 2. Workers in middle-term booster (67-94 days) group reported a significantly greater increase in HPD use in Year 2 than those in other timeframes, when potential covariates were controlled for. Conclusion(s): Booster intervention letters mailed between 67 and 94 days post-initial intervention may promote HPD use among participants. Future research should explore additional factors associated with optimal booster design, including more innovative mobile and internet-based approaches. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among construction workers has long been recognized as a problem in the United States, yet little is known about the prevalence of NIHL among American construction workers. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss among operating engineers (OEs) who operate heavy construction machinery. Method(s): As a part of hearing protection intervention, an audiometric test was conducted for both ears at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz in the soundproof booth. Prior to the audiometric test, a paper-pencil pre-hearing test questionnaire was administered and an otoscopic examination was completed. Prevalence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels (HTLs) in the worst ear with a low fence of 25 dB. Result(s): A total of 623 workers were included in the analysis and they were predominantly middle-aged Caucasian males (mean age = 43 years, Caucasian = 90%, male = 92%). Over 60% of OEs showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive higher frequencies of 4 and 6 kHz. The rate of hearing loss was particularly higher among workers who reported longer years of working in the construction industry. Workers showed significantly poorer hearing in the left ear, and a typical characteristic of NIHL, a V-notch at 4 or 6 kHz, was not shown in this population. Thirty-eight percent reported ringing/buzzing in the ear and 62% indicated having problems in understanding what people say in loud noise. Average reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) was 48% of the time they were required to be used. Significant inverse relationship was found between higher frequency (4-6 kHz) hearing loss and use of HPDs (r = -.134, p < 0.001). Workers using HPDs more had significantly better hearing than those who did not. Conclusion(s): The study demonstrated a significant NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in OEs. An effective hearing conservation program, including a periodic audiometric testing and hearing protection intervention, for this study population should be in place. © 2005 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objectives Simultaneous PET/MRI scanners can combine the functional information from PET with the soft tissue definition of MRI beyond what PET/CT hybrid systems offer currently. The time required to screen patients for MR safety, position the MR coils and scan with patient tailored whole body (WB) and organ specific MR sequences can add significantly to total exam time. Overall workflow optimization is discussed for WB time-of-flight (TOF) oncologic imaging on the GE Signa PET/MRI scanner. Methods Efficient workflow is essential for minimizing technologist radiation exposure. Due to the added steps of placing coils, respiratory bellows, ear protection, etc., the patient is positioned 45 min post injection for a targeted PET emission acquisition starting approx. 60min post injection. The procedure is reviewed and the patient is screened for MR safety. While the patient changes into MR compatible clothes, the exam is set up at the console. The exam begins with MR Ax, Sag and Cor localizer scans over 4 MR stations. Stations are pasted together to resemble a CT localizer scan and used for both PET bed positioning and prescribing of MR sequences. The PET scan is prescribed first and sets the region for MR scans within each PET bed. A WB scan is 6-8 beds with 3-4 repeating MR sequences confined to each PET bed, lasting 3-4min each. These include the attenuation correction scan, Ax DWI, Cor DWI, and Cor SSFSE. MR slice thickness and field of view are maintained for every PET bed to allow for pasting of images for WB PET/MR image fusion. Breath holds are utilized For MR sequences over the chest and abdomen. Upon PET completion, MR contrast injection and WB Ax LAVA-Flex sequences complete the scan. Results WB oncologic PET/MR procedure times have been reduced from >120min to 45-60min and will continue to improve as sequence optimization is established. Conclusions Issues being assessed include determining ideal sequence selection while minimizing MR artifacts, allowing for dedicated scanning tailored to patient history including higher resolution, organ specific imaging, reduction of scan time, and minimizing image artifacts.

AB  - Hearing is the sense of man which never sleeps. Through the ear, we perceive, among other things, voices and music; moreover, the ear also warns us against approaching dangers that manifest themselves acoustically. However, the ear can unfold and lastingly maintain its astonishing capabilities as long as it remains undamaged by too many loud noises. Musicians, while pursuing their profession, are frequently subjected to decibel levels which, in the long run, may lead to hearing impairment. As the decibel level can neither be reduced by architectural measures nor by generally soft playing to the point where hearing damage can be ruled out, each musician should acguire intensive knowledge to determine whether and how he, as an individual, can protect himself in his own particular case. Each musician should grant his sense of hearing regular rest periods and should have his hearing examined regularly, in order to recognize possible impairment promptly. © 2006 Schattauer GmbH.

AB  - This study was undertaken to quantify hearing thresholds in a large sample of percussionists and to evaluate factors that might increase or decrease a percussionist's risk for music-induced hearing loss. Audiometric and musical history data were collected from 315 percussionists attending the Percussive Arts Society International Convention in Louisville, Kentucky, in November 2004. Hearing thresholds for percussionists were compared to an age- and gender-matched, otologically normal reference population. Results indicate that hearing thresholds of percussionists are significantly worse than those of their age- and gender-matched peers, although differences appear to be small. Hearing was worse in the left ear of percussionists. The prevalence of hearing loss was 39% in percussionists vs. 9% in the reference population. Factors identified as increasing the risk for hearing loss included using amplification systems, playing rock/pop music, having more years of experience, and considering oneself a professional. Increased playing time and playing classical or jazz music were not found to increase a percussionist's risk for hearing loss. Benefits of wearing hearing protection devices (HPDs) were observed only for individuals who used foam earplugs when practicing. It is recommended that percussionists not only use HPDs and decrease practice and performance intensity levels but also participate in annual audiologic evaluations, including otoacoustic emission testing, to prevent music-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Not all audiograms having a high frequency notch are due to noise damage. Head trauma and genetic factors may account for them, and another possible cause has been a presumed idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss having a NIHL-like audiometric configuration. The concept of that diagnostic entity has previously been based only on retrospective evidence, which by its very nature must leave an element of doubt: but the concept is now evidenced prospectively by the case presented here. Seven annual monitoring audiograms between 1991 and 1997 showed very good hearing and no sign of developing NIHL. That would not have been expected anyway in view of both closely supervised and self-reported use of hearing protective devices that were more than sufficient for the noise concerned. Between 1997 and 1998 a hearing loss developed with a NIHL-like audiogram, marked notches at 4 kHz. Its fairly rapid increase over four years and subsequent levelling off has been documented by a further ten audiograms up to 2003 and one post-employment audiogram in 2004. Since 2001 a 1.5 kHz notch also developed and increased at first, but more recently has been decreasing. It is argued on five grounds that noise damage is very unlikely to be the cause of the hearing losses. As no artefact or other cause could be discovered to explain this man's hearing disorder, we have categorized it as idiopathic. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - As advanced signal processing algorithms have been proposed to enhance hearing protective device (HPD) performance, it is important to determine how directional microphones might affect the localization ability of users and whether they might cause safety hazards. The effect of in-the-ear microphone directivity was assessed by measuring sound source identification of speech in the horizontal plane. Recordings of speech in quiet and in noise were made with Knowles Electronic Manikin for Acoustic Research wearing bilateral in-the-ear hearing aids with microphones having adjustable directivity (omnidirectional, cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid). Signals were generated from 16 locations in a circular array. Sound direction identification performance of eight normal hearing listeners and eight hearing-impaired listeners revealed that directional microphones did not degrade localization performance and actually reduced the front-back and lateral localization errors made when listening through omnidirectional microphones. The summed rms speech level for the signals entering the two ears appear to serve as a cue for making front-back discriminations when using directional microphones in the experimental setting. The results of this study show that the use of matched directional microphones when worn bilaterally do not have a negative effect on the ability to localize speech in the horizontal plane and may thus be useful in HPD design. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Abnormal auditory sensations or tinnitus caused by abnormal middle ear muscle contraction are extremely rare and uncomfortable for patients. A 67-year-old man who performed paint and body work for cars presented at our hospital with complaint of an audible and annoying abnormal sound that was synchronous with the striking of his hammer against the metal of the car body during his work. The patient reported that the sound was audible of left ear with a split-second delay after his hammer struck the metal. Preoperative subjective and objective testing failed to reveal any abnormal findings in our case. The patient's symptom was successfully cured by selective transection of the stapedius tendon. The characteristic nature of tinnitus with a split-second delay after striking the metal helped our diagnosis and method of intervention in this case.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs (HCP) and their specific components in reducing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Method(s): This retrospective cohort study was conducted at one food-processing plant and two automotive plants. Audiometric and work-history databases were combined with historical noise monitoring data to develop a time-dependent exposure matrix for each plant. Historical changes in production and HCP implementation were collected from company records, employee interviews and focus groups. These data were used to develop time-dependent quality assessments for various HCP components. 5478 male (30 427 observations) and 1005 female (5816 observations) subjects were included in the analysis. Result(s): Analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Females tended to have less NIHL at given exposure levels than males. Duration of noise exposure stratified by intensity (dBA) was a better predictor of NIHL than the standard equivalent continuous noise level (Leq) based upon a 3-dBA exchange. Within this cohort, efficient dBA strata for males were <95 versus >=95, and for females <90 versus >=90. The reported enforced use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) significantly reduced NIHL. The data did not have sufficient within-plant variation to determine the effectiveness of noise monitoring or worker training. An association between increased audiometric testing and NIHL was believed to be an artifact of increased participation in screening. Conclusion(s): Historical audiometric data combined with noise monitoring data can be used to better understand the effectiveness of HCPs. Regular collection and maintenance of quality data should be encouraged and used to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions.

AB  - Shooting is an activity that exposes military personnel to noise impact, which may cause irreversible effects on hearing. Objective(s): To evaluate impact noise on the hearing of military personnel that practice shooting. Study design: A case-control retrospective study. Method(s): 115 military personnel were enrolled; 65 had been exposed to impact noise and 50 were non-exposed. Firearm noise levels were evaluated, subjects answered a questionnaire and underwent threshold tonal audiometry and otoacoustic emissions testing. Result(s): The average noise level was 125dB(C). Most subjects (78%) believe that noise may cause hearing loss; nearly all (92.3%) used ear noise protectors while shooting, but most (32.3%) had never received guidance for using this equipment. There were significant differences between the two groups in relation to changes suggesting impact noise-induced hearing loss. Conclusion(s): The differences between groups show that noise-exposed military personnel are more likely to develop hearing loss. The goal of a hearing conservation program for this population should be to preserve hearing and educate these individuals about the importance of using hearing protection correctly.

AB  - Background: Listening to music is one of the most common forms of recreational noise exposure. Previous investigators have demonstrated that maximum output levels from headphones can exceed safe levels. Although preferred listening levels (PLL) in quiet environments may be at acceptable levels, the addition of background noise will add to the overall noise exposure of a listener. Use of listening devices that block out some of the background noise would potentially allow listeners to select lower PLLs for their music. Although one solution is in-the-ear earphones, an alternative solution is the use of earmuffs in conjunction with earbuds. Purpose(s): There were two objectives to this experiment. The first was to determine if an alternative to inthe- ear earphones for noise attenuation (the addition of earmuffs to earbuds) would allow for lower PLLs through a portable media player (PMP) than earbuds. The second was to determine if a surrounding background noise would yield different PLLs than a directional noise source. Research Design: This was an experimental study. Study Sample: Twenty-four adults with normal hearing. Data Collection and Analysis: PLLs were measured for three earphone configurations in three listening conditions. The earphone configurations included earbuds, canal earphones, and earbuds in combination with hearing protection devices (HPDs). The listening conditions included quiet, noise from one loudspeaker, and noise from four surrounding loudspeakers. Participants listened in each noise and earphone combination for as long as they needed to determine their PLL for that condition. Once the participant determined their PLL, investigatorsmade a 5 sec recording of the music through a probe tube microphone. The average PLLs in each noise and earphone combination were used as the dependent variable. Ear canal level PLLs were converted to free-field equivalents to compare to noise exposure standards and previously published data. Result(s): The average PLL asmeasured in the ear canal was 74 dBA in the quiet conditions and 84 dBA in the noise conditions. Paired comparisons of the PLL in the presence of background noise for each pair of earphone configurations indicated significant differences for each comparison. An inverse relationship was observed between attenuation and PLL whereby the greater the attenuation, the lower the PLL. A comparison of the single noise source condition versus the surrounding noise condition did not result in a significant effect. Conclusion(s): The present work suggests that earphones that take advantage of noise attenuation can reduce the level at which listeners set music in the presence of background noise. An alternative to in-theear earphones for noise attenuation is the addition of earmuffs to earbuds.

AB  - The use of hearing protectors is considered the only short-term solution available to severe noise problems. In this paper the noise leak pathways through the protector to the ear channel were investigated. Noise attenuation measurements were carried out for a circumaural earmuff protector to quantify the effect of various parameters and modifications on the earmuffs, such as: internal foam lining, vibration of earmuff cover, type and force of contact between the earmuff and the head face. The assays were undertaken using an artificial head according to ANSI S12.42-1995 and a diffuse sound field according to ISO 4869-1. The coherence function between cup vibration and sound pressure inside the cup has shown that a great amount of sound energy is transmitted to the inside of the cup at low frequencies: 100-320 Hz. The foam lining of the cup clearly attenuated the sound in the frequency range between 2000 and 8000 Hz. The attenuation measured with a complete earmuff and the same without the cushion has shown that sound leakage occurs at frequencies ranging from 125 to 2000 Hz. A Vaseline coating between the head surface and the cushion improved the attenuation by less than 5 dB (100-200 Hz). As the headband force increases to a maximal deformation of the cushion, attenuation reaches 20 dB at 200 Hz. The increase in the headband force is however a limiting factor to the use of the earmuff, as it can get too uncomfortable. In this work the bone conduction is negligible. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Rates of noise-induced hearing injury (NIHI) among U.S. active duty military have not been previously described using available military medical surveillance data. Method(s): NIHI were identified in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) using a list of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes selected in collaboration with military audiologists. To provide a more comprehensive view of the NIHI problem, NIHI-related ICD-9 codes beyond the traditional 388 noise injury-code set were included. Visit rates by gender and age group are reported by quarter, 2003-2005. Overall frequencies and rates by occupational specialty, 2003-2005, are also described. Result(s): From 2003 to 2005, rates for men were significantly higher than rates for women, with rate ratios (RR) ranging from 1.15 (95% CI=1.07, 1.23) to 1.78 (95% CI= 1.62, 1.93). Rates among women ranged from 2.9 to 6.2 per 1000 person-years; rates among men ranged from 4.5 to 6.7 per 1000 person-years. NIHI rates were highest among those aged >= 40 years and lowest among those aged 17-19 years, with RRs ranging from 3.06 (95% CI=2.77, 3.40) to 5.51 (95% CI=4.88, 6.30) during this time period. Among occupational groups, general officers/executives had the highest NIHI rate over this time period (29.5/1000 person-years), followed by enlisted personnel in training (14.3/1000 person-years) and scientists and professionals (12.8/1000 person-years). Conclusion(s): While data on outpatient injury causes and use of hearing protection are also needed to guide the future design and/or modification of interventions, existing military medical surveillance provides essential information for tracking NIHI and monitoring NIHI intervention effects.

AB  - Purpose: Unequivocally, MRI is the gold standard for anatomical and functional imaging of the brain. Clinical protocol mandates imaging of the brain for all infants born under 32 weeks gestational age yet only a handful of hospitals in the United States routinely use MRI for patients in the NICU. One challenge is the necessity to keep the infants' head still during the MRI scan, and subsequently clinicians sedate the infant. Recent work at the University of Washington has established a safe and successful protocol for transport and MRI scans in unsedated neonates. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of non sedation MRI scans of the infant brain in inpatient and outpatient clinical setting in infants less than 6 months. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty seven infants have been enrolled in this project. Seven infants were outpatients; two of the seven were typically developing. The remaining participants were inpatients in a NICU with risk factors for brain injury. For outpatients, MRI sounds were provided to familiarize the participant with the sounds an MRI scanner makes. In addition, participants received practice materials such as earplugs and a hat to try on at home. Parents were instructed to familiarize their baby for 1 week before the scheduled scan. Participants came to the MRI facility at night time, 8 pm or after. Infants were swaddled, outfitted with earphones, and placed in the extremity (knee) coil of a 3 Tesla MR scanner. All infants were monitored by electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and a pediatric nurse. Result(s): The success rate for these scans was 33/37 on the first attempt and 36/37 on the second attempt. These success rates are higher than reported in the literature for the few leading programs in the country that routinely use nonsedation MRIs. In addition, the presence of motion artifact as reported by a neuroradiologists was noted in less than 5% of all sequences. Conclusion(s): These results join others in suggesting that a non sedation protocol for MRI scans of the brains is feasible in both research and clinical settings. Training for the staff and participants is essential for success.

AB  - Background Mining has long been recognised as a dangerous occupation, with exposure to hazardous sound levels leading to permanent hearing loss a pervasive risk. Increased noise exposure has been associated with increased injury risk in other industries, but this relationship has not been explored among US miners. We examined this relationship among US coal miners. Methods US Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulatory datasets from 2000 to 2013 were linked using a unique mine identifier and year of observation (mine-year); datasets included: noise-surveys (30-CRF-part 62), citations, mine employment, and, injury reports (30-CRF-part 50). The association between sound levels (as an 8-hour time-weighted average) and injury rates were examined using bivariate analysis and Poisson regression. Covariates included mine characteristics (e.g., number of employees, coal type, existence of a safety committee) and noise survey/citation results (e.g., hearing protection worn by the miner surveyed, violation issuance). Results Among the 18,589 unique mine-years were 59,301 injury records, 4,129 mines, and 149,045 noise measurements. In regression analysis, factors significantly and positively associated with injury rates included: noise level (1.8% [95% CI: 1.7, 1.8] increase for each decibel increase in sound level); working in an anthracite vs. bituminous mine (20%, 95% CI: 12.7, 27.3); and, the existence of a safety committee (5.9%, 95% CI: 3.7, 7.9). Protective factors included use of any hearing protection (e.g. cap only -6.1%, 95% CI: -3.9, -8.2) and whether the survey resulted in a violation (-14.7%, 95% CI: -6.4, -23.0). Discussion We observed a positive and significant relationship between increased noise and increased injury rates in US coal mines. This may be the result of more machinery operating and at higher rates of production, resulting in more injuries as well as interference with communication. Further work is needed to understand the mechanism of this relationship and the contribution of other factors.

AB  - Background: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) occurs in many industries despite interventions such as hearing conservation programmes. Aim(s): To determine the actual and reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) in noise-exposed gold mine workers and their reported knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to NIHL and HPDs. Method(s): A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in which 101 noise-exposed mine workers were interviewed and their use of HPDs observed. Result(s): Thirteen percent of respondents erroneously indicated that their workplaces were not noisy, 16% did not appreciate noise as a hearing loss hazard, 6% did not know that HPDs protect hearing and 3% believed that HPDs did not protect hearing. While 93% of respondents reported using HPDs, only 50% were observed to be doing so. Observed use was less among lower skilled workers, and, despite training, 8% of respondents claimed never to have been informed about the benefits of HPDs. Consistent and continuous use was reported by 24% and 31% of respondents, respectively. Reasons for not using HPDs included discomfort. Most respondents (57%) preferred training methods other than the current computer-assisted training. Conclusion(s): The persistence of NIHL may be explained by limited use of HPDs, along with the suboptimal knowledge of noise as a hazard, workplace noisiness and the benefits of HPDs among some workers. Concurrent with engineering controls, a range of HPDs should be available free of charge, and HPD training reviewed particularly for lower skilled workers. © The Author 2009.

AB  - Introduction. Although quarry operations have high economic significance, the effects they cause to the workers in terms of excessive noise production cannot be overlooked. This cross-sectional study assessed the extent of noise exposure and its influence on hearing capabilities among quarry workers in Ashanti region. Methods. The study involved 400 workers randomly selected from five quarries in Ashanti region from April to June 2012. Data was collected using structured questionnaires, physical examination, and audiological assessments. A logistic regression model was fitted to assess independent predictors of hearing loss. Results. All the machines used at the various quarries produced noise that exceeded the minimum threshold with levels ranging from 85.5 dBA to 102.7 dBA. 176 (44%) of study respondents had hearing threshold higher than 25 dBA. 18% and 2% of these were moderately (41-55 dBA) and severely (71-90 dBA) impaired, respectively. Age, duration of work, and use of earplugs independently predicted the development of hearing loss. Use of earplugs showed a protective effect on the development of hearing loss (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.84). Conclusion. This study provides empirical evidence on the extent of damage caused to quarry workers as a result of excessive noise exposure. This will support the institution of appropriate protective measures to minimize this threat.Copyright © 2016 Charles Kwame R. Gyamfi et al.

AB  - The study was conducted on a group of 90 traffic policemen aged 20-50 years and working in and around Patiala district to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practices toward the ill effects caused by traffic noise on health. The subjects were required to fill up a questionnaire regarding their self-assessment of hearing ability, noise-related attitudes, and the use of personal protective equipment such as earplugs. The mean age of subjects was 39.8 +/- 5.80 years, while the mean duration of exposure to traffic noise was 10.56 +/- 6.43 years. Only 5.5% subjects felt that their hearing was below average. As many as 61% subjects had work-related tinnitus. It was observed that none of them had ever used ear plugs, mainly due to their non availability. The self-assessment of hearing by traffic policemen indicated that most of them had normal hearing. However, to find out the exact number of cases with hearing impairment, further evaluation with audiometry is recommended in them.

AB  - This research appraisal, guided by the CASP Randomised Controlled Trial Checklist, critiques a randomised, controlled trial of patient-directed music therapy compared to either noise-cancelling headphones or usual care. This study recruited 373 alert, mechanically-ventilated patients across five intensive care units in the United States. The Music Assessment Tool, administered by a music therapist, facilitated music selection by participants in the intervention group. Anxiety was measured using the VAS-A scale. Sedation exposure was measured by both sedation frequency and by sedation intensity using a daily sedation intensity score. Context for the data was supported by an environmental scan form recording unit activity and by written comments from nurses about the patient's responses to the protocol. Patient-directed music therapy allowed a significant reduction in sedation frequency compared to noise-cancelling headphones and usual care participants. Patient-directed music therapy led to significantly lower anxiety and sedation intensity compared to usual care, but not compared to noise-cancelling headphones. This is a robust study with clear aims and a detailed description of research methods and follow-up. While no participants were lost to follow-up, not all were included in the analysis: 37% did not have the minimum of two anxiety assessments for comparison and 23% were not included in sedation analysis. While some participants utilised the intervention or active control for many hours-per-day, half the music therapy participants listened for 12min or less per day and half of the noise-cancelling headphone participants did not appear to use them. While the results suggest that patient-directed music therapy and noise-cancelling headphones may be useful and cost-effective interventions that lead to an overall improvement in anxiety and sedation exposure, these may appeal to a subset of ICU patients. The self-directed use of music therapy and noise-cancelling headphones means these findings may not transfer to sedated or cognitively-impaired patients.Copyright © 2015 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

AB  - Aims: The Fort McMurray Demonstration Project in Social Marketing blended occupational safety and injury prevention in community-based, participatory health promotion project. Setting(s): A small, industrial city in northern Alberta, which experienced an economic downturn during the study period which resulted in demographic changes. Participant(s): The project relied heavily on community-based partners and participants. Saturation penetration of safety messages was achieved for the resident population. Measurements: Results from a telephone survey of 120 residents conducted in 1995 were compared with results from a survey conducted in 1992 using the same questionnaire. Finding(s): There was little change in most self-reported safety-related behaviours and a reported decline in compliance with eye and ear protection. However, subjects in the 1995 survey round were a survivor population because they had stayed through the downturn and were older, less well educated, and earned less than the sample in 1992. Conclusion(s): Injury rates changed dramatically during the study period in both the intervention and reference communities but self-reported safety-related behaviours in the monitoring survey did not change with the decline in injuries, as would be expected. Respondent bias is the most likely explanation for the absence of demonstrable change. Taking into account that the findings are confounded by a demographic transition in the community, there is still no evidence that the intervention changed safety-related behaviour in the community in the face of an already strong downward trend in injury frequency in the province as a whole. We conclude that future community-level interventions require a different model.

AB  - Purpose: This preliminary study developed a digital graphic novella targeting hearing protection beliefs of Spanish-speaking agricultural workers. Researchers used pretest-posttest interview surveys to establish if the novella had an immediate influence on the participants' beliefs about noise-induced hearing loss and usage of hearing protection devices., Method: Researchers developed a digital graphic novella directed to increase knowledge about noise-induced hearing loss and increase the proper use of hearing protection devices. The novella was tailored to meet the specific linguistic and literacy needs of Spanish-speaking agricultural workers. Thirty-one Spanish-speaking farmworkers of Mexican nationality participated. This study included an interview survey with specific questions on noise-induced hearing loss, myths, and hearing protection device usage. A pretest-posttest design was applied to measure the graphic novella's immediate influence on workers., Results: The posttest scores on Hearing Protection Beliefs statements were significantly better than pretest scores, with a large effect size observed., Conclusion: Digital media may be an effective way to overcome language and literacy barriers with Spanish-speaking workers when providing health education and prevention efforts.

AB  - Hearing protection devices (HPD) are commonly used to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss. There is a large body of research on hearing protection use in industry, and much of it relies on workers' self-reported use of hearing protection. Based on previous studies in fixed industry, worker self-report has been accepted as an adequate and reliable tool to measure this behavior among workers in many industrial sectors. However, recent research indicates self-reported hearing protection use may not accurately reflect subject behavior in industries with variable noise exposure. This study compares workers' self-reported use of hearing protection with their observed use in three workplaces with two types of noise environments: one construction site and one fixed industry facility with a variable noise environment, and one fixed industry facility with a steady noise environment. Subjects reported their use of hearing protection on self-administered surveys and activity cards, which were validated using researcher observations. The primary outcome of interest in the study was the difference between the self-reported use of hearing protection in high noise on the activity card and survey: (1) over one workday, and (2) over a 2-week period. The primary hypotheses for the study were that subjects in workplaces with variable noise environments would report their use of HPDs less accurately than subjects in the stable noise environment, and that reporting would be less accurate over 2 weeks than over 1 day. In addition to noise variability, other personal and workplace factors thought to affect the accuracy of self-reported hearing protection use were also analyzed. This study found good agreement between subjects' self-reported HPD use and researcher observations. Workers in the steady noise environment self-reported hearing protection use more accurately on the surveys than workers in variable noise environments. The findings demonstrate the potential importance of noise exposure variability as a factor influencing reporting accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the natural history of hearing loss (HL) in Israeli military aviators and its risk factors., METHODS: Audiometric results of aviators with available audiometry at ages 30 and 40 years, and up to their last available audiometry were retrieved. HL DEFINITION: pure-tone threshold (PTT) of 30 dB or higher in at least one frequency in at least one ear, moderate-to-severe (M-S) HL as PTT of 45 dB or higher, and suspected noise-induced HL (NIHL) as HL at 3 to 6 kHz. Potential risk factors for HL were assessed by the chi(2) test and logistic regression models., RESULTS: 298 aviators were included. Rates of HL increased with age, up to 57.5% at age 50. All M-S HL at age 50 years had clues on previous examinations, but new HL was observed in all ages. Age was found as a statistically significant risk factor, but aircraft type was not. Total flying hours were found to be an independent risk factor for suspected NIHL only. Self-reported earplug use was not found to protect from HL, with methodological limitations., CONCLUSIONS: HL is prevalent in aviators. Age and total flying hours are risk factors, the latter probably only for NIHL, whereas aircraft type is not.Reprint & Copyright © 2016 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.

AB  - Introduction. Parents as day-to-day caregivers looking after their children's health and upbringing are crucial in the process of hearing loss prevention among the young. The aim of the study was to assess the parents' knowledge and awareness of hazards bringing about hearing loss, possibilities to prevent this, as well as their reaction in the case of problems of their children with hearing. Material and methods. The research group comprised respondents (402 persons), medical or paramedical professionals. None of the surveyed was a doctor. 56% of the surveyed were inhabitants of large cities, 24% of small towns, and 20% of village, mostly located in the area of Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) (97%). To perform the research a survey was devised. GSES scale was applied as an accessory tool. Results. The subjects surveyed posses a great deal of knowledge concerning basic conditions that could adversely affect the hearing of children. Village inhabitants are half as afraid of hearing loss hazards as the inhabitants of large cities. More than 40% of the respondents claimed they do nothing to counteract their children's overexposure to noise. In 48.5% of cases, GPs had not drawn parents' attention to possible complications resulting from upper respiratory tract infections in children. Parents know where they should go to in case their children develop hearing problems or sudden hearing loss. Conclusions. Knowledge and awareness of factors that may trigger hearing loss is not synonymous with avoidance of the problem. Main components of hearing loss prevention among children and youths should be administrative actions, extensive education, and proper childcare at home.Copyright © 2017, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

AB  - Many music organizations are opposed to restrictive noise regulations, because of anxiety related to the possibility of a decrease in the number of adolescents attending music events. The present study consists of two research parts evaluating on one hand the youth's attitudes toward the sound levels at indoor as well as outdoor musical activities and on the other hand the effect of more strict noise regulations on the party behavior of adolescents and young adults. In the first research part, an interview was conducted during a music event at a youth club. A total of 41 young adults were questioned concerning their opinion toward the intensity levels of the music twice: Once when the sound level was 98 dB(A), LAeq, 60min and once when the sound level was increased up to 103 dB(A), LAeq, 60min . Some additional questions concerning hearing protection (HP) use and attitudes toward more strict noise regulations were asked. In the second research part, an extended version of the questionnaire, with addition of some questions concerning the reasons for using/not using HP at music events, was published online and completed by 749 young adults. During the interview, 51% considered a level of 103 dB(A), LAeq, 60min too loud compared with 12% during a level of 98 dB(A), LAeq, 60min . For the other questions, the answers were similar for both research parts. Current sound levels at music venues were often considered as too loud. More than 80% held a positive attitude toward more strict noise regulations and reported that they would not alter their party behavior when the sound levels would decrease. The main reasons given for the low use of HP were that adolescents forget to use them, consider them as uncomfortable and that they never even thought about using them. These results suggest that adolescents do not demand excessive noise levels and that more strict noise regulation would not influence party behavior of youngsters.

AB  - Objectives: Many studies have documented a high incidence of hearing loss and tinnitus in adolescents after recreational noise exposure. The prevalence of noise-induced symptoms is in contradiction to the low preventive use of hearing protection. The effects of preventive campaigns on the attitudes toward noise in young people are under debate. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether a preventive campaign can alter attitudes toward noise in adolescents and whether this results in an increase of hearing protection use in this population. Method(s): A cohort of 547 Flemish high school students, aged 14 to 18 years old, completed a questionnaire prior to and after a governmental campaign focusing on the harmful effects of recreational noise and the preventive use of hearing protection. At both occasions the attitudes toward noise and toward hearing protection were assessed by use of the youth attitudes toward noise scale (YANS) and the beliefs about hearing protection and hearing loss (BAHPHL), respectively. These questionnaires fit into the model of the theory of planned behavior which provides a more clear insight into the prediction of a certain behavior and the factors influencing that behavior. Result(s): The score on the YANS and the BAHPHL decreased significantly (p<0.001) implying a more negative attitude toward noise and a more positive attitude toward hearing protection. The use of hearing protection increased significantly from 3.6% prior to the campaign to 14.3% (p=0.001) post campaign in students familiar with the campaign. Conclusion(s): Measurable alteration of all the variables in the theory of planned behavior caused an increase of the intentions to use hearing protection as well as the actual use of hearing protection. The present study shows the usefulness of the theory of planned behavior to change and guide adolescents' preventive actions toward noise damage. In addition, preventive campaigns can establish attitude and behavioral adjustments. However, the long term effects of preventive campaigns should be investigated in future research. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Adolescents and young adults often are exposed to potentially damaging loud music during leisure activities. As a consequence, more and more young adults suffer from tinnitus, hearing loss, and hyperacusis. The present study provides prevalence numbers for noise-induced tinnitus (NIT) in this group, the attitude toward loud music, and the factors influencing the use of hearing protection (HP). A questionnaire was undertaken to evaluate the influence of permanent/transient tinnitus after loud music, the attitudes toward noise, influence of peers, and the ability to manipulate HP on the use of HP. The questionnaire was completed by 145 university students. Approximately 89.5% of the students had experienced transient tinnitus after loud music exposure. The prevalence of transient NIT was higher in female subjects compared with male students. Permanent NIT was experienced by 14.8%. Nevertheless, few respondents were worried, and the degree of HP use was low (11%). However, the presence of permanent tinnitus was a motivation for HP use. Most respondents held a neutral to positive attitude (i.e., pronoise) toward loud music and were not fully aware of the risks of too much noise exposure. NIT is a common phenomenon among young adults. The lack of knowledge in young adults and the underuse of HP in leisure activities provide useful information to refine preventive measures in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of different control settings of level-dependent hearing protectors on speech recognition performance in interaction with hearing loss., DESIGN: Controlled laboratory experiment with two level-dependent devices (Peltor PowerCom PlusTM and Nacre QuietPro) in two military noises., STUDY SAMPLE: Word recognition scores were collected in protected and unprotected conditions for 45 participants grouped into four hearing profile categories ranging from within normal limits to moderate-to-severe hearing loss., RESULTS: When the level-dependent mode was switched off to simulate conventional hearing protection, there were large differences across hearing profile categories regarding the effects of wearing the devices on speech recognition in noise; participants with normal hearing showed little effect while participants in the most hearing-impaired category showed large decrements in scores compared to unprotected listening. Activating the level-dependent mode of the devices produced large speech recognition benefits over the passive mode at both low and high gain pass-through settings. The category of participants with the most impaired hearing benefitted the most from the level-dependent mode., CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that level-dependent hearing protection circuitry can provide substantial benefits in speech recognition performance in noise, compared to conventional passive protection, for individuals covering a wide range of hearing losses.

AB  - Noise is one of the most harmful agents in the workplace. In addition to the adverse effects of noise on the auditory system, as a stressor it may cause increased blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, anxiety, and impaired secretion of hormones. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in urinary catecholamines in workers exposed to industrial noise. This is an experimental study of the workers at the smelter section of Sarcheshmeh Copper Industries done on two separate days. During the first day, urine samples from 20 workers who did not use any hearing protection device, were collected during an 8-h work shift and on the second day the same was done but they were asked to use earplugs. Also 20 people were selected as a control group from people who were not exposed to noise at work. Urinary catecholamine levels were measured with ELISA kits. The mean urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in the workers (without earplugs) was respectively 8.69 and 35.56 mug/8h on the first day and on the second day (with earplugs) dropped to 6.45 and 30.95 mug/8h. Noise reduction by earplugs led to almost significant reductions in urinary epinephrine (p = 0.05) and significant reductions in norepinephrine (p = 0.02). The results showed that with noise reduction the urinary excretion of stress hormones, especially norepinephrine significantly decreases and workers are probably less prone to stress-related disorders. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Information on prevalence and risk factors associated with self-reported hearing health among mass transit riders is extremely limited, even though evidence suggests mass transit may be a source of excessive exposure to noise. Data on mass transit ridership were collected from 756 study participants using a self-administered questionnaire. Hearing health was measured using two symptom items (tinnitus and temporary audiometric threshold shift), two subjective measures (self-rated hearing and hearing ability), and two medical-related questions (hearing testing and physician-diagnosed hearing loss). In logistic regression analyses that controlled for possible confounders, including demographic variables, occupational noise exposure, nonoccupational noise exposure (including MP3 player use) and use of hearing protection, frequent and lengthy mass transit (all forms) ridership (1,100 min or more per week vs. 350 min or less per week) was the strongest predictor of temporary threshold shift symptoms. Noise abatement strategies, such as engineering controls, and the promotion of hearing protection use should be encouraged to reduce the risk of adverse impacts on the hearing health of mass transit users.

AB  - Excessive noise exposure is a serious global urban health problem, adversely affecting millions of people. One often cited source of urban noise is mass transit, particularly subway systems. As a first step in determining risk within this context, we recently conducted an environmental survey of noise levels of the New York City transit system. Over 90 noise measurements were made using a sound level meter. Average and maximum noise levels were measured on subway platforms, and maximum levels were measured inside subway cars and at several bus stops for comparison purposes. The average noise level measured on the subway platforms was 86 +/- 4 dBA (decibel-A weighting). Maximum levels of 106, 112, and 89 dBA were measured on subway platforms, inside subway cars, and at bus stops, respectively. These results indicate that noise levels in subway and bus stop environments have the potential to exceed recommended exposure guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), given sufficient exposure duration. Risk reduction strategies following the standard hierarchy of control measures should be applied, where feasible, to reduce subway noise exposure. © 2006 The New York Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Over 11 million individuals exhibit some degree of permanent noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). Despite such data, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence on the knowledge of noise exposure and hearing protection devices (HPDs) for young adults, particularly those of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. This lack of research is unfortunate, as prior research suggests that the incidence of NIHL can be reduced through educational programs, such as hearing conservation programs (HCPs). Moreover, research also indicates that such educational programs are more beneficial when developed for specific age and/or ethnic/racial groups. The primary aim of this investigation was to determine the knowledge base of 200 college-aged young adults aged 18-29, concerning the auditory mechanism, NIHL, and the use of HPDs. The second aim of this study was to identify race and ethnicity differences or similarities in knowledge of these areas among African-American and caucasian young adults. Overall, in many instances, a majority of the young adults in our study demonstrated a high degree of knowledge concerning factors associated with exposure to excessive noise and the risk of hearing loss. Yet, the results also revealed significant racial/ethnic differences in knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes about the use of HPDs. Recent estimates suggest that more than 11 million individuals in the United States exhibit some degree of NIHL. Moreover, 40 million individuals work in environments that contain potentially harmful noise levels, and over 50 million Americans routinely use firearms-a common cause of noise-induced hearing impairment. A specific hallmark manifestation of NIHL is a permanent decrease in hearing sensitivity from 3,000-6,000 Hz, with a characteristic notch at 4,000 Hz. Additional effects of exposure to high noise levels include physiological changes in heart rate and blood pressure, decrease in work productivity, and an interference with communication that results from the masking of speech. With these considerations in mind, the purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of a young-adult population in the United States concerning the factors that contribute to NIHL and the use of hearing protection. Additionally, this study was interested in whether there were racial/ethnic differences or similarities in knowledge of hearing loss and the use of HPDs among African-American and caucasian young adults.

AB  - Objectives: To determine if the noise levels of wind exposure experienced by cyclists reaches levels that could contribute to noise-induced hearing loss. Method(s): An aero-acoustic wind tunnel that can generate wind speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour (MPH) was used to provide different speeds encountered by a cyclist. Wind speed ranged from 15 to 60 MPH. Two microphones attached to the ears of the cyclist were used to measure the wind-noise soundpressure- level (dB SPL) experienced by the cyclist. Sound measurements were taken with the head positioned at 15degree increments relative to the wind from 0degree to 180degree at each of the 10 speeds. Result(s): Wind noise ranged from 85 dB at 15 MPH and increased proportionally with speed to a maximum of 120 dB at 60 MPH. Wind sounds were perceived the loudest at 120 dB to the downstream ear when the cyclist was 30degree away from the wind. Conclusion(s): The wind noise experienced by a cyclist is proportional to speed and the directionality of wind gusts. The noise falls in the range that can produce noise trauma. Interestingly, noise exposure is greater to the downstream ear. This may be due to the turbulence observed to this side. Consideration of ear protection for cyclists during prolonged rides is advised to avoid cumulative effects of noise trauma. This needs to be tempered by the need of the rider to hear road sounds and avoid potential trauma.

AB  - Objectives Conventional imaging techniques for primary and metastatic prostate cancer detection are limited in specificity and sensitivity. 68Ga-labeled DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (68Ga-RM2, formerly known as 68Ga-Bombesin or BAY86-7548) is a novel synthetic bombesin receptor antagonist that targets gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr). GRPr are highly overexpressed in prostate cancer. Simultaneous PET/MR combines high-resolution PET data with the soft tissue definition of MRI. We reviewed the feasibility of 68Ga-RM2 PET/MR imaging in patients with prostate cancer using the GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner, as well as the overall procedure workflow. Methods Participants were recruited and consented under an IRB approved research protocol. 68Ga-RM2 was produced using a 68Ge/68Ga E&Z generator and timed for delivery 45min after participant arrival. This allows time for consenting, procedure review, MR safety screening and IV line placement. Vitals were recorded prior to injection and at scan completion. Due to the added steps of whole body (WB) MR such as placing coils, respiratory bellows, and ear protection, patients were positioned 35min post-injection for a targeted PET acquisition start time of 45-60min post-injection. MR localizer sequences over 4 stations were used for PET bed positioning and prescription of MR sequences. PET is acquired from mid-thigh to vertex (to avoid bladder filling) for 6 beds (3-4min each). MR attenuation correction, T1-weighted, T2-weighted and DWI sequences are included in each bed. Additional DWI and T2-weighted prostate specific sequences are included in the WB prescription and careful placement of the pelvic bed over the prostate was a critical step, such that these MR sequences were centered over the prostate bed. The pelvic bed was acquired for 15min for the additional MR sequences. MR slice thickness and field of view were maintained for every PET bed to allow for pasting of images for WB PET/MR co-registration. Breath holds were utilized for MR sequences over the chest and abdomen. Upon PET completion, a high-resolution DISCO sequence was performed over the prostate bed with dynamic gadobutrol injection. Results 16 men (59-83 year-old; mean+/-SD: 69.9+/-7.3) were injected with 140.6-152.6 MBq (mean+/-SD: 147.6 +/-5) of 68Ga-RM2 and imaged using the GE SIGNA PET/MR. The uptake time between injection and start of PET acquisition ranged 41-63 minutes (mean+/-SD: 48.9+/-6.2) and total scan time ranged 65-91minutes (mean+/-SD: 77.2+/-10.9). All scans resulted in images of diagnostic quality. Vital signs were stable in all patients and no adverse events were recorded. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-RM2 provided diagnostic images in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Total scan times varied greatly between initial scans. Patients with prostatectomy did not initially receive dedicated prostate imaging. Also, 6 participants received additional delayed post-void PET/MRI over the pelvis. Issues being assessed include the need for improved scatter correction of PET data, evaluating the benefit of delayed pelvis PET/MR and determining whether patients with radical prostatectomy benefit from dedicated high-resolution MR imaging.

AB  - While occupational injury is associated with numerous individual and work-related risk factors, including long working hours and short sleep duration, the complex mechanisms causing such injuries are not yet fully understood. The relationship between the infrasound pressures of the tympanic membrane [ear canal pressure (ECP)], detected using an earplug embedded with a low-frequency microphone, and the carotid artery [carotid artery pressure (CAP)], detected using a stethoscope fitted with the same microphone, can be quantitatively characterized using systems analysis. The transfer functions of 40 normal workers (19 to 57 years old) were characterized, involving the analysis of 446 data points. The ECP waveform exhibits a pulsatile character with a slow respiratory component, which is superimposed on a biphasic recording that is synchronous with the cardiac cycle. The respiratory ECP waveform correlates with the instantaneous heart rate. The results also revealed that various fatigue-related risk factors may affect the mean magnitudes of the measured pressures and the delay transfer functions between CAP and ECP in the study population; these factors include systolic blood pressure, salivary amylase activity, age, sleep duration, postural changes, chronic fatigue, and pulse rate. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - To test an economically reasonable method to reduce thermal stress, we performed an alternated intervention-control study on 2 groups of 8 male steel workers performing the same jobs, using 21 of water at ambient temperature (23.5degreeC +/- 1.4), poured on the head and hands. Each group participated for 2 d as control and 2 d as intervention during 4 consecutive summer days in Brazil, 5 h per shift per day. Testing was done by: 1) recording of temperature by thermistors placed on the external ear canal through earplug, skin (chest, upper arm, inner thigh, outer calf) and clothes; 2) recording of heart rate; and 3) Wet Bulb Globe Temperature recording. The intervention was held hourly, when body weight and water intake were evaluated. Symptoms and subjective sensations were evaluated in the beginning and at the end of each shift. No differences were observed in external ear canal and skin temperatures. Subjective thermal sensation (p=0.018), sweat perception (p=0.043), and tiredness (p=0.028) presented positive statistically significant results when comparing intervention to control measurements. In conclusion, our results could not provide evidence that the proposed method cools the analyzed temperatures, although the subjective evaluation suggests a decrease in the head skin temperature, which could be a useful comfort measure.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing disorder has been thoroughly studied among workers in industry-like settings, but less so in femaledominated occupations. In Sweden, noise-related occupational disease among women are reported most frequently in the education sector. We analysed questionnaires from 4,932 women with preschool teacher's degree who have worked in preschool compared to 5,065 randomly selected women without preschool work-history (response rate 51% vs. 38%). The age range was 24-71 in both cohorts (mean 46 [SD 11] among preschool teachers and 51 [11] among controls). Prevalence and prevalence ratio in agestrata and Mantel-Haenszel pooled risk were calculated for hearing-related symptoms. Noise exposure was compared between the cohorts. A 5% level of significance was applied. Occupational noise exposure and noise annoyance were significantly more common among teachers than controls: 75% vs.31% and 69% vs.26%, respectively. Still, significantly fewer teachers used hearing protection: 3% vs. 4%. Prevalence of hearing-related symptoms was much higher among teachers than controls: sound-induced auditory fatigue (71% [95% CI: 70-72] vs. 31% [30-32]), difficulty perceiving speech (46% [45-47] vs. 26% [25-27] and hyperacusis (38% [37-39] vs. 18% [17-19] and slightly higher for hearing loss (19% [18-20] vs. 17% [6-18] and tinnitus (19% [18-20] vs. 15% [14-16]. Teachers had a twofold risk of sound-induced auditory fatigue (PR-MH 2.2 [95% CI: 2.1-2.3] and hyperacusis (PR-MH 2.1 [1.9-2.2] compared to controls, when adjusted for age. The risk was also increased for difficulty perceiving speech (PR-MH 1.8 [1.7-1.9], tinnitus (PRMH 1.4 [1.3-1.6] and hearing loss (PR-MH 1.4 [1.3-1.5]. Mean age of onset was significantly lower among teachers for all symptoms, except for hyperacusis (p = 0.902). Leisure-noise was significantly more common among controls. Family history of hearing loss did not differ (p = 0.411). The study is the first to show that preschool teachers have an increased risk of hearing-related symptoms, which may be caused by the work environment.

AB  - Introduction Agricultural aviation pilots, exposed daily to intense vibration and noise, are likely to develop noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of audiograms consistent with NIHL in agricultural aviation pilots who use earplugs and helmets. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional cohort and observational study. The data were taken from the medical records and audiograms of 94 pilots. Results NIHL was identified in 9.5% of individuals with hearing loss by audiograms at 3,000, 4,000, or 6,000 Hz. Normal audiograms were observed in 46.8% of pilots surveyed. Bilateral hearing loss was more frequent than unilateral hearing loss, occurring in 64.8% of cases. Conclusion Although there was a low incidence of audiograms compatible with NIHL in the records of the pilots examined, the disorder still occurs despite the doubled use of individual hearing protection equipment (helmets and earplugs) for agricultural aviation pilots. Nevertheless, even with the use of earplugs and helmets as noise protectors, the data showed that agricultural pilots suffer inner ear damage caused by occupational noise. Prevention and periodic audiologic evaluations must be conducted in noise-exposed occupational groups.Copyright © 2016 by Thieme Publicacoes Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

AB  - Forest logging involves the use of various noise-producing equipment, which may be harmful to the hearing capabilities of operators in the immediate area. Yet, little research has been performed to determine the long term effect of noise on forest loggers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine how noise from forestry work affects operators' hearing capabilities at different frequencies, in relation to their age, years of experience as forest loggers, and whether or not they regularly wore hearing protection equipment (HPE). Twenty-six male forest loggers who were directly involved with logging equipment operations participated in this study. They were divided into different groups depending on age (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59), years of experience (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, and 31-40), and whether they used HPEs. A Beltone audiometer was used to measure hearing thresholds at different frequencies (125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000Hz). To determine whether the loggers experienced threshold shifts, their hearing thresholds were compared with average persons' hearing thresholds. The hearing threshold and threshold shift were found at 4000Hz, and the lowest hearing thresholds were found at 500, 750, and 1000Hz. According to results, as age increased, hearing threshold either increased or remained the same. This study also concluded that the years of experience or exposure to forestry equipment can adversely affect hearing. Participants that used HPE had lower hearing thresholds than participants that did not use HPE. By wearing HPE, forest workers may prevent hearing loss at 4000Hz. Relevance to industry: Forest logging has adverse effect on the hearing of workers. Specifically the loggers who do not use hearing protection equipment are more susceptible to hearing loss. Therefore, the hearing of workers needs to be monitored on a regular basis and the use of HPE should be made mandatory.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Firearm impulses are common noise exposures in the United States. This study records, describes and analyzes impulses produced outdoors by civilian firearms with respect to the amount of auditory risk they pose to the unprotected listener under various listening conditions. Risk estimates were obtained using three contemporary damage risk criteria (DRC) including a waveform parameter-based approach (peak SPL and B-duration), an energy-based criterion (A-weighted SEL and equivalent continuous level) and a physiological model (AHAAH). Results from these DRC were converted into a number of maximum permissible unprotected exposures to facilitate interpretation. Acoustic characteristics of firearm impulses differed substantially across guns, ammunition, and microphone location. The type of gun, ammunition and the microphone location all significantly affected estimates of auditory risk from firearms. Vast differences in maximum permissible exposures were observed; the rank order of the differences varied with the source of the impulse. Unprotected exposure to firearm noise is not recommended, but people electing to fire a gun without hearing protection should be advised to minimize auditory risk through careful selection of ammunition and shooting environment. Small-caliber guns with long barrels and guns loaded with the least powerful ammunition tend to be associated with the least auditory risk.

AB  - This study aimed to perform an ergonomic evaluation of industrial processes and products - upholstered sofas - produced in the furniture cluster of Uba-MG. The used material was collected from two sofas upholstered industries associated with the union of the furniture industries of Uba region, located in Minas Gerais estate, Brazil. As for the product were evaluated dimensionally 29 upholstered sofas, with 12 being produced by industry "A" and 17 being produced by industry "B". As for the process, were evaluated: the socioeconomic profile of the worker and environmental factors of lighting and noise. The main results of this study showed that the upholstered sofas produced by industries, in general, fulfilled to the recommendations set out in the work in relation to the backrest height and useful seat depth. All the sofas, however, proved to be inadequate in relation to the seat height to the floor and the dimensions of the armrests Regarding environmental aspects, it was observed that in both industries, the activities in most jobs are performed under adverse conditions to the health and safety of workers and nonconformity with the limits set by Brazilian regulatory standard used in this work.

AB  - Occupational noise has been related to cardiovascular events, although epidemiologically, there is not a clear explanation. To determine the development of arterial hypertension in workers exposed to a noise level higher than 85 dB (A) and to relate it with the working place, labor antiquity and the use of auditive protection, a case-control study was done in a Venezuelan oil company. Fifty working men, that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were included in each group. The information was obtained from the occupational clinical history, based on international guidelines, to evaluate the parameters of the study, The intensity of environmental noise was obtained according to recommended Venezuelan "Norma COVENIN 1565-95". The mean age of cases and controls were 39 +/- 0.06 and 44 +/- 0.44 years old respectively; the labor seniority was similar in both groups; 22 an 48% of cases and controls respectively had a family history of arterial hypertension (p<0.05), without a high significant prevalence in both groups. In both groups we observed overweight. In 92% of cases and 80% of controls there were normal levels of glucose (p<0.01); 68 and 84% of cases and controls, respectively, presented alterations of the lipid levels (p<0.05). The measurements of environmental noise registered levels that exceeded 85 dB (A), being the mean 87.78 +/- 1.10 dB (A); 94% of the cases used hearing protective equipment and 60% of them presented arterial hypertension and 80% of those that did not used it, showed arterial hypertension. There was not a significant relationship among the auditive loss induced by occupational noise, its intensity and labor seniority with the prevalence of arterial hypertension. We cannot conlude that occupational noise is a decisive factor in the development of arterial hypertension in noise exposed workers.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the second most prevalent self-reported occupational illness or injury in the U.S., and agricultural workers experience high rates of hearing loss. This article uses Intervention Mapping (IM), a systematic approach to intervention development, to make recommendations for a program to improve hearing loss protection among farmworkers and managers. Final recommendations, based on previous work in the literature on hearing loss prevention, qualitative formative research, and theoretical considerations, include a specification of a multilevel theory- and evidence-based hearing protection program for farmworkers and farm managers. Twelve performance objectives (e.g., "monitor hearing and hearing loss with regular hearing testing") are specified and crossed with six relevant determinants (knowledge and behavioral capability; perceived exposure and susceptibility and noise annoyance; outcome expectations; barriers; social influence; skills and self-efficacy) to create a highly detailed matrix of change objectives for farmworkers and for their managers. These change objectives are then grouped into five categories: two for both farmworkers and their managers (noticing exposures, taking action) and three only for the latter (surveying and planning, implementation and evaluation, and communication). Theoretical methods and practical strategies, including program materials and activities, are then delineated. © ASABE.

AB  - Purpose The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of hearing problems among a national cohort of emergency medical service (EMS) professionals, determine factors associated with hearing problems, and estimate the percentage of EMS professionals who utilize hearing protection. Methods Utilizing results from a questionnaire, individuals who reported hearing problems were compared to individuals who had not. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify variables associated with hearing problems. Finally, items regarding use of hearing protection were assessed to estimate the percentage of usage among EMS professionals. Results In total, 1, 058 (57%) participants responded to the questionnaire. Of those, 1, 024 (97%) who completed the hearing problems question were utilized for analysis. There were 153 (14.9%) cases of self-reported hearing problems. The final logistic regression model included lifetime occupational noise exposure 0.99 (95% CI=0.9997-1.0002), report of previous back problems (odds ratio (OR)=2.74, 95% CI=1.8340-4.1042), large community size (OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.1211-2.4843), and minority status (OR=0.61, 95% CI=0.3719-0.9867). Finally, 213 (20.8%) individuals reported utilizing some form of hearing protection at their main EMS job. Conclusion The results from this analysis are the first national estimates of the prevalence of self reported hearing problems among EMS professionals. This study was also the first to estimate the percentage of EMS professionals who self reported the utilization of hearing protection. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background and Aim: Noise is the most common and also preventable harmful physical pollutant in the workplace in the world. Although the hearing protection devices are the last way to prevent hearing loss, most people do not use the equipment properly and consistently. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of theory-based training on the rate of using hearing protection devices in workers of autoparts factories in Qazvin Industrial Towns. Material(s) and Method(s): Using random sampling method, 120 workers from two autoparts factories in Kaspian and Alborz Industrial Towns were entered into this experimental study. Data collection tools included demographic questions and self-reporting questionnaire to measure TPB related constructs indirectly. The intervention program was composed of two 90 minute group discussion along with targeted educational booklet. Using SPSS version 20, data collected at different times were analyzed by chi-square, independent t-test and ANOVA. Result(s): After the intervention, we found increased mean scores for: attitude (from 36.0+/-17.3 to 64.5+/-22.8), subjective norms (from 28.5+/-10.7 to 46.8 +/- 12.4), perceived behavioral control (from 41.8+/-19.3 to 72.1 +/- 21.5), behavioral intention (from 3.6+/-3.1 to 7.5+/-3.8). Also use of hearing protection devices significantly increased in the experimental group (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): Educational intervention based on the theory of planned behavior led to increased use of hearing protection devices among workers. Designing educational programs based on the above mentioned theory in order to increase the use of personal protective equipment in workers is recommended.Copyright © 2017, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - It seems to be a common opinion among researchers within the field of audiology that the prevalence of tinnitus will increase as a consequence of environmental factors, for example exposure to loud noise. Young people are exposed to loud sounds, more than any other age group, especially during leisure time activities, i.e. at pop concerts, discotheques and gyms. A crucial factor for the prevention of hearing impairments and hearing-related symptoms in the young population is the use of hearing protection. The focus of the present study is use of hearing protection and self-reported hearing-related symptoms, such as tinnitus and noise sensitivity in a young population of high-school students (N=1285), aged 13 to 19 years. The results show that the prevalence of permanent tinnitus and noise sensitivity, reported in the total group, was 8.7% and 17.1% respectively. Permanent tinnitus was not significantly related to level of socio-economic status, but age-related differences in the prevalence rates of experienced tinnitus and noise sensitivity were found to be significant. Older students reported such symptoms to a greater extent than younger students did. Those who reported tinnitus and other hearing-related symptoms protected their hearing to the highest extent and were the ones most worried.

AB  - The focus of the present study, of 1285 adolescents, was young people's attitudes towards noise and their use of hearing protection at discos and pop concerts. Comparisons were made between adolescents from different age groups, and with different socio-economic status. Logistic regressions indicated that "worry before attending noisy activities" and "hearing symptoms" such as tinnitus and noise sensitivity could, to some degree, explain the use of hearing protection in noisy environments. Another conclusion to be drawn from this study was that adolescents' attitudes and behaviours regarding hearing protection use differed between levels of socio-economic status. Individuals with high SES expressed more negative attitudes and used ear protection to a greater extent than those with lower SES. This result might indicate differences in the development of future auditory problems among individuals with different levels of socio-economic status. The cause of hearing impairment and tinnitus may not be restricted merely to noise exposure. Psychological aspects, such as attitudes towards noisy environments and the individual's behaviour regarding the use of hearing protection may be considered as important factors in the understanding of why the prevalence of hearing-related problems has increased among adolescents.

AB  - The present study investigates differences between a Swedish and an American sample of young students regarding attitudes towards noise and the use of hearing protection at concerts. The study population was comprised of 179 participants from Sweden and 203 participants from the United States, who ranged in age from 17 to 21 years. Questionnaires were used to gather information on hearing symptoms and attitudes towards noise (Youth Attitude to Noise Scale). Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that attitudes towards noise differed significantly due to gender and country. Men had slightly more positive attitude towards noise than women, and men from the USA had more positive attitudes than men from Sweden. Least positive were the women from Sweden (except regarding attitudes towards the ability to concentrate in noisy environments). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influence of attitudes towards noise and country on young people's use of hearing protection at concerts. The results indicated that attitudes and country explained 50% of the variance in use of hearing protection. © 2006 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - PURPOSE: The intensity of noise levels in a basketball arena during games, as well as the hearing sensitivity of attendees, was measured for the purpose of assessing the impact of the noise on hearing thresholds., METHOD: Noise levels at 10 intercollegiate basketball games were measured with a dosimeter affixed on the shoulders of attendees. Hearing thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were measured for 20 participants just before attending a basketball game and within an hour of the end of the game to determine whether changes in hearing thresholds resulted from exposure to the sound levels within the arena during the games., RESULTS: Participants demonstrated temporary shifts in pure-tone thresholds and reductions in the intensity of their otoacoustic emissions after attendance at 1 of the basketball games. Dosimeter measurements showed that noise at 6 of the 10 basketball games exceeded acceptable intensity levels when compared with a national workplace noise exposure standard., CONCLUSION: Although noise intensities, on average, did not exceed workplace exposure standards, universities would be wise to be proactive in warning spectators about the potential dangers of noise exposure at sporting events, make earplugs available to interested spectators, and implement a hearing conservation program for employees working in noise.

AB  - Introduction: Noise exposure is the most common preventable cause of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); however, once acquired, it is irreversible. The predominant damage occurs to the hair cells and their associated nerves leading to the hearing loss. Objective(s): To determine the prevalence and also to evaluate the awareness and practices regarding prevention of occupational NIHL in the selected industry, to emphasize the critical importance of educating industry workers regarding NIHL and its prevention. Methodology: All staff working in the selected plywood industry excluding the ones with chronic otitis media were included. Relevant history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using prestructured questionnaire based proforma. All of them underwent pure tone audiometry. Result(s): Of 111 workers who were exposed to noise, 51.85% had NIHL, the average ambient noise being 80.5 dB. The most common complaints in workers with NIHL was hearing loss (52.6%), difficulty in hearing in noisy surroundings (43.9%), and difficulty in telephonic conversations (38.6%). There was a significant number (47.4%) who were asymptomatic. The majority had mild (56.1%) and moderate (38.6%) hearing loss. Majority of them with NIHL belonged to the age group of 30 60 years. This study showed a positive correlation between duration of noise exposure and degree of hearing loss. No one has ever used any sort of ear protection devices nor aware of health effects associated with noise exposure and its prevention. Conclusion(s): Considering zero awareness, screening, education, and prevention methods are emphasized to reduce the impact of noise exposure at workplace.Copyright © 2016 Indian Journal of Otology Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

AB  - Objectives: Although noise-induced hearing loss is completely preventable, it remains highly prevalent among construction workers. Hearing protection devices (HPDs) are commonly relied upon for exposure reduction in construction, but their use is complicated by intermittent and highly variable noise, inadequate industry support for hearing conservation, and lax regulatory enforcement. Method(s): As part of an intervention study designed to promote HPD use in the construction industry, we enrolled a cohort of 268 construction workers from a variety of trades at eight sites and evaluated their use of HPDs at baseline. We measured HPD use with two instruments, a questionnaire survey and a validated combination of activity logs with simultaneous dosimetry measurements. With these measurements, we evaluated potential predictors of HPD use based on components of Pender's revised health promotion model (HPM) and safety climate factors. Result(s): Observed full-shift equivalent noise levels were above recommended limits, with a mean of 89.8 +/- 4.9 dBA, and workers spent an average of 32.4 +/- 18.6% of time in each shift above 85 dBA. We observed a bimodal distribution of HPD use from the activity card/dosimetry measures, with nearly 80% of workers reporting either almost never or almost always using HPDs. Fair agreement (kappa = 0.38) was found between the survey and activity card/dosimetry HPD use measures. Logistic regression models identified site, trade, education level, years in construction, percent of shift in high noise, and five HPM components as important predictors of HPD use at the individual level. Site safety climate factors were also predictors at the group level. Conclusion(s): Full-shift equivalent noise levels on the construction sites assessed were well above the level at which HPDs are required, but usage rates were quite low. Understanding and predicting HPD use differs by methods used to assess use (survey versus activity card/dosimetry). Site, trade, and the belief that wearing HPD is not time consuming were the only predictors of HPD use common to both measures on an individual level. At the group level, perceived support for site safety and HPD use proved to be predictive of HPD use. © The Author 2009.

AB  - Objectives: Firearm is a common source of impulse noise that may potentially damage hearing organ. It has been suggested that otoacoustic emissions, particularly transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), might be more sensitive than pure-tone audiometry (PTA) in the assessment of changes to cochlea caused by noise. The aim of this study was to: (i) evaluate exposure to impulse noise from small-caliber weapons, (ii) compare the post-exposure changes in hearing measured by PTA and TEOAE and correlate them with noise parameters. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 18 male hunters (group I) and 28 candidate policemen (group II) exposed to impulse noise from small firearms during target practices. Group I was unprotected during shooting, whereas group II used commonly available hearing protectors. PTA and TEOAE were performed before and 2-10 min after shooting. Exposure to impulse noise was evaluated by in situ measurements. Result(s): Groups I and II were exposed to 3-4 and 4-144 impulses of noise at mean C-weighted peak sound pressure levels of 154 dB and 156 dB, respectively. No post-exposure audiometric threshold shift was observed in group I. Significant reductions of TEOAE levels were found both for the whole response (-2.2 dB SPL) and for 1/2-octave band responses in the frequency range of 1000-4000 Hz (from -1.6 to -3.0 dB SPL). These changes were not correlated with C-weighted peak sound pressure levels or equivalent-continuous A-weighted sound pressure level. Significant correlation was found for peak sound pressure and maximum sound pressure levels in 1/3-octave bands in the frequency range corresponding with the main part of the acoustic energy of impulses (correlation coefficients r from -0.58 to -0.77, p < 0.05). In group II neither PTA nor TEOAE showed significant hearing impairment after shooting. Conclusion(s): The results show that even short-term exposure to impulse noise from small-calibre firearms might cause temporary hearing impairment measured by TEOAE. Therefore, the use of earmuffs is strongly recommended, because most of them seem to effectively attenuate impulse noise from small-calibre firearms.

AB  - Purpose: Although sleep is important for healing, sleep deprivation is a major concern for patients in hospitals. The purpose of this review is to consolidate the observational and interventional studies that have been done to understand exogenous, non-pharmacological strategies for improving sleep in hospitals. Data sources: We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed articles published between 1970 and 2015 in English. Study selection: A title review of 13,113 articles from four databases resulted in 783 articles that were further culled to 277 based on a review of the abstracts. The net result after reading the articles and a hand search was 42 articles. Data extraction: From each article we recorded the independent variables, methods used for measuring sleep and specific sleep outcomes reported. Results of data synthesis: Noise is a modifiable cause of some sleep disruptions in hospitals, and when reduced can lead to more sleep. Earplugs and eye masks may help, but changing the sound and light environment is more effective. Calming music in the evening has been shown to be effective as well as daytime bright light exposure. Nursing care activities cause sleep disruption, but efforts at limiting interventions have not been demonstrated to improve sleep conditions. Conclusion(s): The research is hard to consolidate due to the multitude of independent variables and outcome metrics, but overall points to the potential for making meaningful improvements in the quality of patient sleep.Copyright © The Author 2016.

AB  - METHODS: We analysed annual audiometric data to determine the number of permanent hearing shifts that occurred in employees in two bauxite mines, three alumina refineries and two aluminium smelters. Annual hearing shift rates were calculated based on the number of employees tested per year. Hearing conservation initiatives undertaken during the study period are described. An assessment of similar exposure group noise exposures was also undertaken to determine the magnitude of noise exposure reduction during the study period., RESULTS: Across all operations, hearing shift rates declined from 5.5% per year in 2006 to 1.3% per year in 2013 (P < 0.001). The decline in shift rates was greater in mines and refineries, where baseline shift rates were higher, than in smelter workers. Modest reductions in noise exposure occurred during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantial decline in hearing shift rates during the study period. We describe the hearing conservation initiatives that were collectively associated with this decline. We suspect these initiatives could be deployed relatively easily and at modest cost in other industries with noise-exposed employees., BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss has been an intractable problem for heavy industry., AIMS: To report our experience in reducing the incidence of age-corrected confirmed 10 dB hearing shifts (averaged over 2, 3 and 4 kHz) in employees in the primary aluminium industry in Australia over the period 2006-13.Copyright © The Author 2015.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine how amplified earmuffs affect the intelligibility of speech in noise for people with hearing loss, and to determine how various brands of amplified earmuffs compare in terms of speech intelligibility and electroacoustic response. METHOD(S): The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) was used to measure the intelligibility of speech for 10 participants with hearing loss when they listened in a background of recorded industrial noise at 85 dBA. Participants listened with 3 different sets of amplified earmuffs (Peltor Tactical 7-S, Elvex COM 55, and Bilsom 707 Impact II), with a set of passive earmuffs (E-A-R Ultra 9000), and with ears unoccluded. Two measurements of sentence threshold were obtained under each of the 5 listening conditions. Gain was measured electroacoustically across a range of input levels and frequencies for each amplified earmuff. RESULT(S): Electroacoustic measurements indicated that each electronic earmuff amplified at low input levels and attenuated at high input levels. However, gain characteristics varied greatly across devices. HINT sentence thresholds were not significantly different across the 5 listening conditions or across the 2 trials. CONCLUSION(S): Results suggest that each type of earmuff can be used to reduce the noise exposure of people with hearing loss without compromising their ability to understand speech.

AB  - RELAXATION T1, T2, and T2* relaxation dominate image contrast and affect temporal resolution and even spatial resolution. Resolving adjacent voxels requires putting 1/2 revolution of phase between them in ~T2, which is hard to do if gradients are weak or T2 short. In standard spin-warp imaging, T1/2 <TR <T1. Halving T1 delivers the first image in half the time and speeds up a dynamic series 2 fold. However, because the method can work on ~TR/TE slices at once, cutting T1and TR in half does not change the number of images made per minute. B0 EFFECTS Doubling B0 would quadruple signal by doubling flux and halving the precession period but it also raises noise. S/N increases by factors of 2-(7/4) in small, insulating liquid samples and 2 for large, slightly conductive, common MRI samples. High B0 gives no S/N advantage for hyperpolarized He3, C13, or Xe129. Doubling B0 can raise subject heating, SAR. If an RF pulse does the same thing in the same time, the higher field pulse deposits 4x the energy. If T2* shortening with B0 limits the high B0 pulse to half the duration, the higher field pulse deposits 8x the energy. SUSCEPTIBILITY Susceptibility complicates B0 maps greatly confounding some methods and enabling others. Diamagnetic substances, i. e. having negative susceptibility e. g. water, repel magnetic lines of force thus decreasing the field some places near a diamagnetic object and increasing it elsewhere. The effect range is about the size of the object. The complicated, shapedependent resonant frequency change this makes is comparable to the resonant frequency difference between two lines in proton NMR. This is why frequency-based selective saturation and selective excitation methods are not robust. In some regions, information is missing and cannot be recovered. Exciting everything and keeping track of phase can make selective imaging, e. g. no fat, robust (1) and with special image processing, can even provide more information from images (2,3). The susceptibility difference between oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin led to the first MRI method to show brain function (4). FACILITY DESIGN Facility design has grown simpler because self shielded magnets have compact fields and monitors that are unaffected by magnetic fields replaced cathode ray tubes. Room lighting was difficult because fluorescent lights made images noisy and stray fields made tungsten AC filaments vibrate and fail by fatigue, requiring trained personnel and a nonmagnetic ladder for replacement. LED's outlast imagers. SAFETY Whole body MR has hazards from energy stored in the magnet and from contrast-agent toxicity. Ear protection is needed because of rapid magnetic field gradient changes that rattle any metal in the magnet, even causing painful, direct stimulation in the body. A whole-body imager uses an RF transmitter 10x as powerful as a microwave oven. It is important to know where this power goes. FDA guidelines had to be developed before there were any easy ways to determine subject heating (5,6). Scientifically the safety problem is the same as monitoring thermal ablation or adjuvant heating during radio- or chemo-therapy. Learning Objectives (3-4 Bullet Points): Learn relation of magnetic resonance imaging to Relaxation Field Strength Susceptibility Learn about MRI Facility Concerns MRI Safety.

AB  - Noise is the insidious of all industrial pollutants, involving every industry and causing severe hearing loss in every country in the world. Exposure to excessive noise is the major avoidable cause of permanent hearing impairment. Worldwide, 16% of the disabling hearing loss in adults is attributed to occupational noise, ranging from 7 to 21% in the various subregions. The estimated cost of noise to developed countries ranges from 0.2 to 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is bilateral and symmetrical, usually affecting the higher frequencies (3k, 4k or 6k Hz) and then spreading to the lower frequencies (0.5k, 1k or 2k Hz). Other major health effects are lack of concentration, irritation, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, etc. The major industries responsible for excessive noise and exposing workers to hazardous levels of noise are textile, printing, saw mills, mining, etc. Hearing protectors should be used when engineering controls and work practices are not feasible for reducing noise exposure to safe levels. Earmuffs, ear plugs and ear canal caps are the main types of hearing protectors. In India, NIHL has been a compensable disease since 1948. It is only in 1996 that the first case got compensation. Awareness should be created among workers about the harmful effects of noise on hearing and other body systems by implementing compulsory education and training programs. There are very few published studies of NIHL in India. More extensive studies are needed to know the exact prevalence of NIHL among the various industries in India.

AB  - The intensity of sound emanating from the discharge of magnetic coils used in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can potentially cause acoustic trauma. Per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for safety of noise exposure, hearing protection is recommended beyond restricted levels of noise and time limits. We measured the sound pressure levels (SPLs) from four rTMS coils with the goal of assessing if the acoustic artifact levels are of sufficient amplitude to warrant protection from acoustic trauma per OSHA standards. We studied the SPLs at two frequencies (5 and 10 Hz), three machine outputs (MO) (60, 80 and 100%), and two distances from the coil (5 and 10 cm). We found that the SPLs were louder at closer proximity from the coil and directly dependent on the MO. We also found that in all studied conditions, SPLs were lower than the OSHA permissible thresholds for short (<15 min) acoustic exposure, but at extremes of use, may generate sufficient noise to warrant ear protection with prolonged (>8 h) exposure. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Determine the effect of exposure to a single rock/pop concert on pure-tone hearing thresholds and outer hair cell function in teenagers. Repeated measures pre- and postconcert assessment of hearing. Mobile hearing conservation test vehicle and large indoor concert venue. Twenty-nine normal-hearing teenagers and young adults ages 13 to 20 years. Attendance at a public rock/pop concert. Pre- and postconcert pure-tone thresholds in both ears from 500 Hz to 8 kHz, pure-tone average (PTA) for 2, 3, and 4 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), proportion of subjects experiencing a PTA change of 10 dB or greater. Concert sound levels at the subjects' position averaged 98.5 dBA. Only 3 subjects used the hearing protection provided. Thresholds for 2 to 6 kHz increased significantly from pre- to postconcert (p <= 0.001). The increase in PTA (2, 3, and 4 kHz) between test intervals averaged 6.3 and 6.5 dB for the right and left ears, respectively, and 33.3% of subjects had a threshold shift of 10 dB or greater in the PTA in at least 1 ear (p <= 0.001). The number of subjects experiencing a reduction in DPOAE amplitude (17/25) and the change in mean amplitude were statistically significant (p <= 0.001 and p <= 0.004, respectively). Exposure to a single live-music rock/pop concert can produce a threshold shift and decrease in otoacoustic emissions amplitude indicating impact on outer hair cell function. Results clearly indicate a need for research on this public health issue regarding "safe" listening levels, especially in younger people with more years for accrual of damage.

AB  - Introduction Poor sleep is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and environmental factors, such as noise and light, contribute to sleep deprivation and alterations of sleep architecture. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of earplugs and eye masks on sleep architecture in ICU patients. Patients and methods A single-center randomized controlled trial of 64 ICU patients was conducted from April 2011 to June 2013. Patients were randomly assigned to sleep with or without earplugs and a facemask. A polysomnography was performed on the first day and night following inclusion. The primary end point was the proportion of sleep stage 3 + 4. Secondary end points were other descriptors of sleep and major outcome variables. Results The proportion of sleep stage 3 + 4 was 11 [3-23] % in the control group and 13 [6-23] % in the protective group (p = 0.72). Other descriptors of sleep were not different between the two groups with the exception of long awaking that were less frequent in the protective group than in the control group [21 (19-26) vs. 31 (21-47), p = 0.02]. In the protective group, 20 patients wore the earplugs and 18 of wore their eye mask. There was no difference among the three groups in terms of sleep quality, occurrence of a delirium, ICU length of stay and mortality, anxiety and depression on ICU discharge and day 90 and the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion In ICU patients, earplugs and eye mask do not increase the proportion of sleep stage 3 + 4 but decreased the number of prolonged awakenings. They had no impact on the outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Young people regularly expose themselves to leisure noise and are at risk of acquiring tinnitus. This study examined the prevalence of leisure noise-induced tinnitus among Flemish young adults as well as the relation with sociodemographic factors, health-related variables and attitudes and beliefs towards noise., DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate the presence of noise-induced tinnitus, the amount of leisure noise and attitudes towards noise and hearing protection., STUDY SAMPLE: 517 subjects between 18 and 30 years were included., RESULTS: Temporary and chronic tinnitus occurred in 68.5% and 6.4% of the sample, respectively. Chronic tinnitus was more prevalent in male subjects and associated with more hearing-related symptoms. Furthermore, subjects with chronic tinnitus were more aware of the risks of noise and the importance of hearing protection. Finally, higher levels of leisure noise were independently associated with chronic tinnitus., CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus is observed frequently in young adults. Results also indicate that persons with chronic tinnitus were exposed to a higher noise dose during their lives. Longitudinal studies may be useful to evaluate whether the experience of chronic tinnitus has led to behavioural changes. These findings further underpin the importance of educating youth about the risks of leisure noise exposure.

AB  - SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire regarding hearing, the amount of leisure noise exposure and attitudes towards noise and hearing protection as well as an audiological test battery were completed. Five hundred and seventeen subjects between 18 and 30 years were included., SUBJECT AND METHODS: Hearing was evaluated using conventional audiometry, transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. On the basis of their hearing status, participants were categorised into normal hearing, sub-clinical or clinical hearing loss., STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Independent samples t-tests, chi-square tests and multiple regression models were used to evaluate the relation between groups based on hearing status, sociodemographics, leisure noise and attitudes towards noise., RESULTS: Age was significantly related to hearing status. Although, the subjects in this study frequently participated in leisure activities, no significant associations between leisure noise exposure and hearing status could be detected. No relation with subjects' attitudes or the use of hearing protection devices was found., CONCLUSIONS: This study could not demonstrate clinically significant leisure noise-induced hearing damage, which may lead to more non-protective behaviour. However, the effects of leisure noise may become noticeable over a long-term use since age was found to be related with sub-clinical hearing loss. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of noise exposure., CONTEXT: Young people regularly expose themselves to leisure noise and are at risk for acquiring hearing damage., AIMS: The objective of this study was to compare young adults' hearing status in relation to sociodemographic variables, leisure noise exposure and attitudes and beliefs towards noise.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of an implanted microphone for cochlear implants (CI) by comparison of hearing outcomes, sound quality and patient satisfaction of a subcutaneous microphone to a standard external microphone of a behind-the-ear sound processor. In this prospective feasibility study with a within-subject repeated measures design comparing the microphone modalities, ten experienced adult unilateral CI users received an implantable contralateral subcutaneous microphone attached to a percutaneous plug. The signal was pre-processed and fed into their CI sound processor. Subjects compared listening modes at home for a period of up to 4 months. At the end of the study the microphone was explanted. Aided audiometric thresholds, speech understanding in quiet, and sound quality questionnaires were assessed. On average thresholds (250, 500, 750, 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k and 6 kHz) with the subcutaneous microphone were 44.9 dB, compared to 36.4 dB for the external mode. Speech understanding on sentences in quiet was high, within approximately 90% of performance levels compared to hearing with an external microphone. Body sounds were audible but not annoying to almost all subjects. This feasibility study with a research device shows significantly better results than previous studies with implanted microphones. This is attributed to technology enhancements and careful fitting. Listening effort was somewhat increased with an implanted microphone. Under good sound conditions, speech performance is nearly similar to that of external microphones demonstrating that an implanted microphone is feasible in a range of normal listening conditions.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Hearing prevention experience., PROBLEMS/OBJECTIVES: Many soldiers suffer from serious NIHL due to the lack of an effective hearing prevention policy. To conduct a study to ameliorate the hearing prevention policy., METHODOLOGY: Literature review Results: Sensitization, innovative hearing protection systems, CEP systems for pilots, using OAEs to identify the actual hearing damage of soldiers and motivating them to better protect themselves, and applying the AHAAH algorithm can determine the number of allowable impulses Conclusion(s): 1) In line with European and Belgian legislation in this context, tremendous efforts have been made by the Belgian military for information about and sensitization regarding the issue of NIHL. 2) The high variety of positions, functions and environmental factors in a military setting makes the inventory of noise exposures complex and extensive. 3) Efficacious ear protection systems have been rapidly implemented in relation to the most exposed work conditions and, finally, extended to all potential dangerous environments. 4) The use of OAEs was not only a pivotal element in the screening of military staff, but also in their conscientization towards the potentially dramatic consequences of excessive noise exposure. 5) Currently, some "real-life" measurements are being conducted in order to provide military authorities with a complete cadastre on the noise dangers in the Belgian military. 6) The role of military ENT specialists (i.e., ENT and occupational medicine doctors, totally familiar with the working conditions of military personnel), audiologists and specialists in occupational medicine was critical to the success of these initiatives.

AB  - Objective: To highlight the auditory risk caused by exposure to chemicals in radiology labs products. Report: Radiology is a tool for medicine devoted to the diagnosis of disease through examination of images. In Brazil, most laboratories use chemicals in the process. The literature shows that there are over 200 ototoxic substances, among them the chemicals used in the processing of radiographs. Professionals who work in radiology laboratories are exposed to these chemicals that act slowly in their body, producing medium and longterm adverse effects, such as deafness. Methodology: The study was approved by the Faculty Redeemer (20/2013 ) Ethics. We opted for an empirical and descriptive research, using a semistructured questionnaire applied to professionals in four municipalities of the northwestern state of Rio de Janeiro region. Conclusion(s): Of the 20 coaches who participated in the survey, 90% did not know that the chemicals used are ototoxic, only 35% of them make use of equipment for radiation protection, and 100% do not use protective equipment to chemical exposure. Of these, 95% of participants expressed interest in having a program of prevention and hearing protection in their work. Medical control and occupational health programs should be included in their routine audiometric tests, contributing to the prevention of occupational hearing loss due to ototoxicity.

AB  - This study examined: (1) the value of using the statistical metric, kurtosis [beta(t)], along with an energy metric to determine the hazard to hearing from high level industrial noise environments, and (2) the accuracy of the International Standard Organization (ISO-1999:1990) model for median noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) estimates with actual recent epidemiological data obtained on 240 highly screened workers exposed to high-level industrial noise in China. A cross-sectional approach was used in this study. Shift-long temporal waveforms of the noise that workers were exposed to for evaluation of noise exposures and audiometric threshold measures were obtained on all selected subjects. The subjects were exposed to only one occupational noise exposure without the use of hearing protection devices. The results suggest that: (1) the kurtosis metric is an important variable in determining the hazards to hearing posed by a high-level industrial noise environment for hearing conservation purposes, i.e., the kurtosis differentiated between the hazardous effects produced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise environments, (2) the ISO-1999 predictive model does not accurately estimate the degree of median NIPTS incurred to high level kurtosis industrial noise, and (3) the inherent large variability in NIPTS among subjects emphasize the need to develop and analyze a larger database of workers with well-documented exposures to better understand the effect of kurtosis on NIPTS incurred from high level industrial noise exposures. A better understanding of the role of the kurtosis metric may lead to its incorporation into a new generation of more predictive hearing risk assessment for occupational noise exposure.

AB  - Introduction: Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) suffer from sleep deprivation arising from nursing interventions and ambient noise. This may exacerbate confusion and ICU-related delirium. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that average hospital sound levels should not exceed 35 dB with a maximum of 40 dB overnight. We monitored five ICUs to check compliance with these guidelines. Method(s): Sound levels were recorded in five adult ICUs in the UK. Two sound level monitors recorded concurrently for 24 hours at the ICU central stations and adjacent to patients. Sample values to determine levels generated by equipment and external noise were also recorded in an empty ICU side room. Result(s): Average sound levels always exceeded 45 dBA and for 50% of the time exceeded between 52 and 59 dBA in individual ICUs. There was diurnal variation with values decreasing after evening handovers to an overnight average minimum of 51 dBA at 4 AM. Peaks above 85 dBA occurred at all sites, up to 16 times per hour overnight and more frequently during the day. WHO guidelines on sound levels could be only achieved in a side room by switching all equipment off. Conclusion(s): All ICUs had sound levels greater than WHO recommendations, but the WHO recommended levels are so low they are not achievable in an ICU. Levels adjacent to patients are higher than those recorded at central stations. Unit-wide noise reduction programmes or mechanical means of isolating patients from ambient noise, such as earplugs, should be considered. © 2013 Darbyshire et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a major cause of deafness and hearing impairment in the United States. Though genetics and advanced age are major risk factors, temporary and permanent hearing impairments are becoming more common among young adults and children especially with the increased exposure to portable music players. Though treatment options are limited for most people with noise-related hearing loss, several modifiable health behaviors that should begin in childhood might prevent or delay the onset of hearing impairment. The purpose of this article is to review modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, comorbidity, and the role of health education in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. METHOD(S): Review of current literature in the etiology, prevention, and treatment of noise-induced hearing loss as well as the role of health education. RESULT(S): Nonmodifiable risk factors related to noise-related hearing loss include increasing age, genetics, male gender, and race. Modifiable risk factors are voluntary exposure to loud noise, nonuse of hearing protection, smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet, tooth loss, and the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION(S): As hearing impairment among children and teenagers rises due to mostly voluntary exposure to loud noise, there are many implications for health education. Health educators need to address barriers to the use of hearing protection, deliberate exposure to loud music, and other modifiable risk factors, which cause and exacerbate hearing loss among those exposed to loud noise. © 2007, American School Health Association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices for hearing and respiratory health/safety among farmers in seven Midwestern states served by a federally funded Agricultural Center. Findings provided a baseline to longitudinally track the Agricultural Center's program outcomes and to design community education to improve safety and health among farmers., DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This was a cross-sectional study using a 30 item mailed survey to describe farmers' operations, demographics, health conditions, related information sources, and knowledge/attitude/practices for personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e., ear plugs/muffs and dust masks/respirators)., MEASURES: Frequencies and percentages were calculated for each item and according to responses from younger versus older farmers. The unit of study was farm operators (N = 280) randomly selected from a publicly available database of corn/soybean and hog farmers in seven Midwestern states., RESULTS: Findings revealed important knowledge gaps among respondents regarding (1) hazardous exposure sources; (2) long-term health consequences of noise/dust exposure; (3) proper selection/fitting of PPE., CONCLUSIONS: Public health nurses and primary care providers in rural communities should address specific knowledge gaps in order to enhance farmers' perceived understanding of their susceptibility to hazardous exposures. Increasing farmers' knowledge through preferred venues may help to improve PPE effectiveness.Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Occupational noise exposure causes fatigue, lapses of concentration and hearing loss. The thresholds for problematic noise exposure are well established, and in the UK governed by the Health and Safety Executive using the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 requiring employers to prevent or reduce risks to health and safety from exposure to noise at work. These control the average weekly noise employees are exposed to, and a peak level which must not be exceeded. The daily average not to be exceeded is 85 dB, and a peak level of 135 dB. Are we as surgeons exposed to dangerous noise levels in the operating theatre (OT)? Study: Standardised digital recordings of noise levels in maxillofacial OTs in a district hospital. Finding(s): Noise in the OTs originated from a variety of sources, including vacuum suction, drills, diathermy equipment, telephones, audio equipment and conversations unrelated to the procedures. Average noise levels did approach the limit of the daily average not to be exceeded, but peak levels were not reached. Noise levels tended to rise as the operating list progressed. Summary: We think of the OT as an environment that is safe for patients and staff. Whilst some hazards, such as sharps injuries are well-recognised, there are other hazards, including occupational noise exposure. Noise reduction is the preferred strategy, as obviously ear protection would limit communication.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to determine the effect of an acute simulated unilateral hearing loss on children's spatial release from masking in two-talker speech and speech-shaped noise, and (2) to develop a procedure to be used in future studies that will assess spatial release from masking in children who have permanent unilateral hearing loss. There were three main predictions. First, spatial release from masking was expected to be larger in two-talker speech than in speech-shaped noise. Second, simulated unilateral hearing loss was expected to worsen performance in all listening conditions, but particularly in the spatially separated two-talker speech masker. Third, spatial release from masking was expected to be smaller for children than for adults in the two-talker masker., DESIGN: Participants were 12 children (8.7 to 10.9 years) and 11 adults (18.5 to 30.4 years) with normal bilateral hearing. Thresholds for 50%-correct recognition of Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentences were measured adaptively in continuous two-talker speech or speech-shaped noise. Target sentences were always presented from a loudspeaker at 0degree azimuth. The masker stimulus was either co-located with the target or spatially separated to +90degree or -90degree azimuth. Spatial release from masking was quantified as the difference between thresholds obtained when the target and masker were co-located and thresholds obtained when the masker was presented from +90degree or -90degree azimuth. Testing was completed both with and without a moderate simulated unilateral hearing loss, created with a foam earplug and supra-aural earmuff. A repeated-measures design was used to compare performance between children and adults, and performance in the no-plug and simulated-unilateral-hearing-loss conditions., RESULTS: All listeners benefited from spatial separation of target and masker stimuli on the azimuth plane in the no-plug listening conditions; this benefit was larger in two-talker speech than in speech-shaped noise. In the simulated-unilateral-hearing-loss conditions, a positive spatial release from masking was observed only when the masker was presented ipsilateral to the simulated unilateral hearing loss. In the speech-shaped noise masker, spatial release from masking in the no-plug condition was similar to that obtained when the masker was presented ipsilateral to the simulated unilateral hearing loss. In contrast, in the two-talker speech masker, spatial release from masking in the no-plug condition was much larger than that obtained when the masker was presented ipsilateral to the simulated unilateral hearing loss. When either masker was presented contralateral to the simulated unilateral hearing loss, spatial release from masking was negative. This pattern of results was observed for both children and adults, although children performed more poorly overall., CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults with normal bilateral hearing experience greater spatial release from masking for a two-talker speech than a speech-shaped noise masker. Testing in a two-talker speech masker revealed listening difficulties in the presence of disrupted binaural input that were not observed in a speech-shaped noise masker. This procedure offers promise for the assessment of spatial release from masking in children with permanent unilateral hearing loss.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the auditory life styles and beliefs of college students with reference to exposure to loud sounds in the context of the health belief model. A survey was administered to 238 (40 men, 198 women) students in the USA. Results suggest that 44% of the students use noisy equipment without ear protection and 29% (69/238) of the students work in noisy environments. Of the 69 who worked in noisy surroundings, only ten reported wearing hearing protection devices although 50 (72.46%) reported tinnitus. The use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) was associated with previous experience with hearing loss and tinnitus. Although 75% of the students were aware that exposure to loud sounds could cause hearing loss, 50% of the students appeared to be exposing themselves to potentially harmful loud music. Furthermore, 46% of the students reported not using HPDs during loud musical activities because they felt that the music was difficult to hear with HPDs. Most students in this study considered hearing loss to be serious but 76% of the students believed that they would not lose their hearing until a greater age. Although 66% of the students had experienced tinnitus, 58% of these students reported not being concerned about it. These results suggest a critical need for promoting healthy hearing behavior among college students. Possible strategies could include improved education, experience with simulated hearing loss for extended periods and availability of cosmetically appealing or invisible HPDs with uniform attenuation across the frequency range.

AB  - Self-reported noise exposure is on the rise in Denmark. Little is known, however, about the social consequences, including sickness absence, of noise exposure. The aim of this paper was to investigate the association between self-reported noise exposure and long-term sickness absence. The association was investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze outcomes in Danish register data on the basis of Danish survey data (5357 employees aged 18-69 in 2000). The analyses showed that self-reported noise exposure was significantly associated with long-term sickness absence for both men and women when adjusting for demographic factors and health behavior. After further adjustment for physical workload at work the association between noise exposure and sickness absence disappeared for women, but not for men. Men that reported to be exposed to loud noise between one-quarter and three-quarters of their time at work had an increased risk of 43% (CI: 10-85%) for sickness absence of two weeks or longer compared to men that reported never to be exposed to loud noise. Men that reported to be little/rarely exposed to loud noise had an increased risk of 37% (CI: 7-76%). Men that reported to be exposed to loud noise more than three-quarters of their time at work did not have an increased risk of sickness absence. This latter result might be due a healthy worker effect and/or more frequent use of hearing protection in this group. Along with evidence from previous studies these results provide further support for an association between occupational noise exposure and sickness absence.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effects of current hearing protection/ enhancement devices (HPEDs) and tactical communications and protection systems (TCAPS) on auditory detection and identification of three critical military signals associated with potential "threats." Design: Utilizing a 6 x 3 within-subject experimental design, 24 normal-hearing Virginia Tech Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and active duty soldiers participated. Study sample: Five HPEDS and TCAP devices plus the open ear were tested. On each trial, either wearing a device or with open ears, subjects walked along a 3000-foot line of discrete distance markers toward the auditory threat, which was not visible but still within line-of-sight over flat terrain, stopping to listen when instructed. On approach to the threat, the linear distance at first detection was measured, followed by a continued approach until positive identification occurred. Then the subject reversed direction, retreating away from the threat until detection was lost. Result(s): ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied to determine statistically-significant differences among HPEDs, TCAPS, and the open ear on the objective detection and identification distance measures. Conclusion(s): The results have serious implications for selection of HPDs, HPEDs, and TCAPS for applications where preservation of auditory situational awareness via the fundamental detection and identification tasks are essential. © 2014 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of noise cancelation earphones (NCE) in audiometric evaluations., DESIGN: Degree of noise reduction of Bose QuietComfort 15 NCE was assessed through probe-microphone measures and sound-field audiometry. Occlusion effects from NCE were assessed for potential effects on bone-conduction thresholds., STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty participants were tested to determine average occlusion effect values during bone-conduction testing with and without NCE. Noise reduction values of the NCE were assessed on a single subject through probe-microphone measures and sound-field testing., RESULTS: NCE sufficiently reduced ambient noise to levels acceptable for air-conduction testing as well as for bone-conduction testing for most patients when adding minimal adjustment to acceptable levels as outlined by the ANSI S3.1-1999 standard. In addition, NCE did not create a clinically significant change in the occlusion effect for bone-conduction testing., CONCLUSION: NCE placed over insert earphones provide a sound pressure level at the tympanic membrane that is below ANSI standards for routine air-conduction testing and result in sufficient ambient noise reduction for bone-conduction testing with most patients. There is no clinically significant occlusion effect from NCE during routine bone-conduction audiometry. These findings support the utility of using NCE for offsite audiometric testing.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the possible association between chronic noise-induced hearing loss and the volume of mastoid pneumatization. Methodology: The study involved 46 subjects employed in the press and montage department of a gun factory: 28 in the study group with noise-induced hearing loss and 18 in the control group with no hearing loss. The volume of mastoid pneumatization was measured with computed tomography. Student's t test was used in the comparison of the mastoid volumes of the study and the control groups. Result(s): The intergroup evaluations showed no significant difference between the study and control group with regards to age, use of substances or ototoxic drugs, systemic diseases, use of personal hearing protectors, duration of occupational and non-occupational noise exposure was observed (P > 0.05). The mean values of mastoid pneumatization in the study and the control groups were 9717.6 mm3 and 11005.8 mm3, respectively. Although the volume of mastoid pneumatization was smaller in the study group than in the control group, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): This preliminary study showed that there was no significant correlation between mastoid pneumatization volume and chronic noise-induced hearing loss. However, this correlation could be significant in further studies with a larger number of subjects.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to test the effects of modulation-based digital noise reduction (MB-DNR) on noise levels, speech intelligibility, and listening preference in four real-world noises. Background(s): A significant challenge in hearing protection device (HPD) design is to reduce ambient noise levels while maintaining users' ability to understand speech. MB-DNR technology, currently employed in hearing aids, potentially could be used to achieve these objectives. Method(s): Speech and noise calibrated to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 0, -5, and -10 dB in the sound field were recorded at the outputs of two digital hearing aids in the ears of a Knowles Electronic Manikin for Acoustic Research with and without MB-DNR activated (i.e., NR and noNR, respectively). Listeners' speech intelligibility scores and sound quality preferences were evaluated while they listened to the recordings presented via ER-3A insert earphones at 85 dB SPL. Result(s): MB-DNR reduced the overall noise level by approximately 4 to 7 dB. Listeners obtained significantly higher speech intelligibility scores in the NR condition at an SNR of -10 dB in two noises and similar scores in the noNR and NR conditions in all other cases. They preferred the NR condition in all cases. Conclusion(s): MB-DNR reduced overall noise level, enhanced sound quality, and maintained or improved speech intelligibility in the four military noises tested. Applications: MB-DNR algorithms potentially could be incorporated into HPDs to enhance performance and increase user acceptance. Copyright © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many adolescents and young adults consciously expose themselves to loud music for entertainment. We hypothesized that these individuals might not be aware that exposure to loud music could result in hearing loss. Furthermore, we wished to assess the feasibility of a web-based survey to collect health information from this group. METHOD(S): A 28-question survey was designed to target adolescents and young adults. The survey contained questions about views toward general health issues, including hearing loss, and was presented to random visitors at the MTV web site. RESULT(S): In 3 days, 9693 web surveys were completed. Hearing loss was defined on a Likert scale as "a very big problem" by 8% of respondents compared with other health issues: sexually transmitted diseases, 50%; alcohol/drug use, 47%; depression, 44%; smoking, 45%; nutrition and weight issues, 31%; and acne, 18%. Notably, most respondents had experienced tinnitus or hearing impairment attending concerts (61%) and clubs (43%). Only 14% of respondents had used earplugs; however, many could be motivated to try ear protection if they were aware of the potential for permanent hearing loss (66%) or were advised by a medical professional (59%). CONCLUSION(S): A majority of young adults have experienced tinnitus and hearing impairment after exposure to loud music. Fortunately, many of these individuals could be motivated to wear ear protection. This novel web-based survey technique rapidly generated a large database and is a feasible method to obtain health data from this group.

AB  - Objective. It has not yet been established whether exposure to chronic noise induces an increase in blood pressure or an increase in the development of hypertension. Therefore, a cohort study was performed to identify the effects of chronic noise exposure on blood pressure. Methods. Five hundred thirty male workers at a metal manufacturing factory in Busan, Korea, were enrolled in the study. They were monitored with an annual health check-ups for nine consecutive years from 1991 to 1999. The subjects were divided into four groups which were determined by noise level categories (NLCs) according to the exposure of noise intensity; NLC-I: office workers who were exposed to <60 dBA at work; NLC-II: worksite technical supporters or inspectors who were intermittently exposed to noise and were not using hearing protection devices; NLC-III: worksite workers exposed to a noise below 85 dBA (TWA) and used one type of hearing protection device, earplug or earmuff; NLC-IV: worksite workers who were exposed to a noise level of 85 dBA or higher in average and used both earplug and earmuff. Results. After controlling the possible confounders, such as baseline age, smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, family history of hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), or diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and changes in body mass index (BMI), we determined that the mean values for the SBP over the duration of this study were 3.8, 2.0, and 1.7mmHg higher in groups NLC-IV, NLC-III, and NLC-II, respectively, in comparison to that of the NLC-I group. There was no significant difference in DBP among the groups. Conclusion. This study suggests that chronic noise exposure increases SBP independently, among male workers. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Evidence has accumulated concerning the adverse effects of noise on hearing acuity, but it is not clear whether working shifts may decelerate the effects of hearing loss. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of shift work on hearing loss in a noisy work environment. A sample of 218 male workers recruited at a semiconductor factory with no known occupational hazards that affected hearing acuity other than noise was chosen. The subjects worked either in an eight-hour or 12-hour shift. A standardized audiometric procedure was performed by a qualified audiologist to measure pure-tone hearing thresholds at 0.5kHz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz and 8kHz in both ears. Using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, smoking habits, and work duration, the results showed that the severity of hearing loss in both ears was significantly lower in subjects who worked a 12-hour shift. In conclusion, working a 12-hour shift followed by a day off is best for workers and hearing protection should be provided in high noise areas.

AB  - Background: Previous studies suggested that hearing impairment based on self-report might increase the risk of agricultural injuries. However, self-reported hearing measures may be subject to inaccuracy and subjective perception. We assessed the association of agricultural injuries with hearing loss and other hearing characteristics using measured hearing. Method(s): Study subjects were 150 farmers who participated in the Iowa Certified Safe Farm study. Injury information was collected by telephone interviews at 2-5 month intervals from September 1999 to October 2002. Hearing levels were measured annually using the pure tone audiometry from 1998 to 2002. Adjusted rate ratios of injuries were calculated using the multivariate Poisson regression model. Result(s): Hearing loss in the better ear (RR = 1.62), hearing asymmetry (RR = 1.67), and fair/poor self-reported hearing (RR = 1.96) were significantly associated with the risk of agricultural injuries. It is notable that self-reported hearing might be a stronger predictor of injuries than pure tone audiometry (PTA). Exposure to noise elevated the risk of injuries in those farmers with hearing loss or hearing asymmetry. The occasional use of hearing protection was significantly associated with agricultural injuries. Conclusion(s): This study adds substantial evidence that hearing loss acts as a risk for agricultural injuries. Prevention of hearing loss and noise exposure may be important in reducing the burden of agricultural injuries. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While there is some evidence of the influences of personal knowledge and organizational factors on workers' hearing protection, a causal model examining relationships between these variables is lacking. METHOD(S): To create and test such a model, this study collected data from 1,701 workers in Hong Kong through a random sample telephone survey. RESULT(S): Fitting the model to the data revealed that organizational regulation of occupational noise protection was a root cause of workers' protective behavior, whereas workers knowledge about the protection exhibited only a minimal effect. CONCLUSION(S): These findings cast doubt on the significance of personal knowledge as a unique factor contributing to noise protection. The study also finds that organizational regulation was predictable by a number of organizational and industrial factors. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: To prevent occupational deafness, organizational regulation accompanied by regular inspection and a norm of noise protection is important.

AB  - Musician earplugs are marketed and recommended for use in music settings but no studies have evaluated these products with musicians. This study evaluated the influences of earplugs on college students' perception and abilities to communicate in a musical environment, attitudes of earplugs, comfort over time, and the influence of earplugs on ability to play music. College students (N = 323) were provided with earplugs for use during and following an experimental condition designed to mimic a night club. Results underline the challenges of earplugs in environments that are both loud and require verbal interaction. Responses to comfort questions were variable and suggest a multi-factorial set of influences that may include intrinsic variables. Despite these limitations, subjects in this study generally liked the earplugs and believed that they are valuable. However, the earplugs were not viewed favorably by musicians willing to use the earplugs while playing music. This study supports the view that earplugs are subject to many problems and should be considered as a last resort. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Music students are not being taught that music is a sound source capable of harming hearing. Ensemble directors of public school and college bands, orchestras, and choirs, are unaware and unprepared to recognize and manage risk from excessive sound exposures. Schools of music and conservatories around the world, and the organizations that accredit them, need to embrace the idea that schools of music are best suited to facilitate change, conduct research, create and impart knowledge, institute competency, and most importantly, cultivate a culture of responsibility and accountability throughout the music discipline. By drawing attention to actions pursued at and through the College of Music at the University of North Texas, the purpose of this paper is to encourage change and to assist others in efforts to reach the best conditions for preventing irreversible hearing disorders associated with music. © 2011 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - RESULTS: Noise-exposed subjects had significantly higher levels of systolic blood pressure(SBP) (125.1+/-13.9 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (77.6+/-10.7 mm Hg) than control subjects (SBP: 117.2+/-15.7 mm Hg, DBP: 70.0+/-10.5 mm Hg) (P<0.001). Significant correlations were found between noise exposure and blood pressure (SBP and DBP) (P<0.001). However, the linear regression coefficients with DBP appeared larger than those with SBP. The prevalence of hypertension was 17.8% in subjects with noise exposure and 9.0% in control group (P<0.001). Compared with the control group, the subjects with noise exposure had the risk of hypertension with an OR of 1.941 (95% CI=1.471- 2.561) after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and drinking status. Dose-response relationships were found between noise intensity, years of noise exposure, cumulative noise exposure and the risk of hypertension (all P values<0.05). No significant difference was found between subjects wearing an earplug and those not wearing an earplug, and between steady and unsteady noise categories (P>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Occupational noise exposure was associated with higher levels of SBP, DBP, and the risk of hypertension. These findings indicate that effective and feasible measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of hypertension caused by occupational noise exposure., BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the primary out-auditory adverse outcome caused due to occupational noise exposure. This study investigated the associations of noise exposure in an occupational setting with blood pressure and risk of hypertension., METHODS: A total of 1,390 occupational noise-exposed workers and 1399 frequency matched non-noise-exposed subjects were recruited from a cross-sectional survey of occupational noise-exposed and the general population, respectively. Blood pressure was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer following a standard protocol. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of noise exposure adjusted by potential confounders.

AB  - To investigate the physical principle governing the level-dependent attenuation of a perforated earplug, a mathematical model is first established with the transfer-matrix method to calculate the noise reduction through a simplified device, one perforated panel with back cavity, mounted in an impedance tube. The model prediction is compared with the measured noise reduction through two series of large-scale devices and one device with the dimensions of the ear canal under continuous noise and sinusoidal excitations. The model helps to improve significantly the level-dependent attenuation of the large-scale device. It also illustrates that the attenuation is not solely determined by the resistance of the orifice, which has been a well accepted design concept, but resulted from an incorporated effect of the acoustic filter comprised of the acoustic impedance of the orifice and other elements in the earplug-ear-canal system. This mechanism can interpret a resonance at low incident levels on improper design and reveal approaches to eliminate it. Finally, the model's potential contributions to the design of a perforated earplug are discussed, along with the threshold of level-dependent attenuation supported with experimental evidence. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Background/Aims: It followed conscious that lift up occupational safety and health and noise problems received respect gradually in working places. The objective is to understand the environment noise of metal furniture manufacturing factory and other related hazards factors on the impact of hearing in workers. Method(s): A metal furniture manufacturing factory workers were 60 as exposed subjects and administrators were 45 as nonexposed subjects. The noise in workplaces and office were estimated by environmental noise spectrum analysis and noise-dosimeters. The pure tone audiometry estimated binaural hearing threshold of workers. Questionnaires assisted results in instruments and conferred reasons that workers had hearing loss. Result(s): The highest spectrum analysis value was 84.16 +/- 1.15 dB(A) in 500 Hz by exposed group. It affected threshold that the highest hearing loss value was 45.08 +/- 14.10 dB(A) in the low-frequency 500 Hz by workers. As to the relative risks (odds ratio: OR) of hearing loss in highfrequency trisection, exposed group as non-exposed group was 12.12 (95% CI: 3.41- 43.00) and older than 37 years old was 18.10 (95% CI: 2.80 -116.93) and smoking habit was 6.07 (95% CI: 1.18 -31.16). Questionnaires showed that age, smoking habit, pre-hypertension, and using hearing protections were significantly associated with the hearing loss Conclusion(s): To suggest workers should use hearing protection at work and take audiometry regularly. To ensure health and reduce hearing loss risk for workers.

AB  - Background/Aims: Noise problems received respect gradually in working places and one of high prevalent occupational diseases was noise hearing loss. If it proceeded precautions beforehand and carried out Hearing Conservation Program certainly, noise-induced hearing loss could be prevented. The cross-sectional study measured the noise in working places and compared by questionnaires. Method(s): The study measured a polyester fiber factory and workers who were 89 exposed subjects and administrators were 38 nonexposed subjects. The working places were estimated using the environmental noise spectrum analysis (LD-824). The personal noise exposure level was estimated using noise-dosimeter and the pure tone audiometry by OSCILLA SM910. According to the gauge sequence surveyed it. Result(s): The result was that Leq = 89.4 +/- 2.6 dB(A) was higher in working places by exposed group. It was more evident high than administrators nonexposed group, which Leq = 60.8 +/- 5.6 dB(A). Bilateral hearing thresholds compared that result found left ears (37.0 +/- 16.5 dB(A)) vs. right ears (36.8 +/- 15.4 dB(A)) with a dip at 4 kHz. In a multivariate logistic model, the high frequency trisection odds ratio was 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI[: = 1.3-7.8), 6-10 years Odds Ratio = 3.4 (95% CI: = 1.1-10.5), and over 11 years Odds Ratio = 3.9 (95% CI: = 1.4 -10.6) by exposed group. To accompany increasing seniority, hearing loss was more serious. Conclusion(s): Personal noise levels were over occupational noise exposure standard 85 dB(A) by workers. In all, 77.5% workers used ear plugs but 22.5% did not use. The factory should notice workers who used ear plugs truly or not. The employer should avoid hearing loss to ensure health for workers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The new Auditory 4.0 model has been developed for the assessment of auditory outcomes, expressed as temporary threshold shift (TTS) and permanent threshold shift (PTS), from exposures to impulse noise for unprotected ears, including the prediction of TTS recovery., METHODS: Auditory 4.0 is an empirical model, constructed from test data collected from chinchillas exposed to impulse noise in the laboratory. Injury outcomes are defined as TTS and PTS, and Auditory 4.0 provides the full range of TTS and PTS dose-response curves with the risk factor constructed from A-weighted sound exposure level. Human data from large weapons noise exposure was also used to guide the development of the recovery model., RESULTS: Guided by data, a 28-dBA shift was applied to the dose-response curves to account for the scaling from chinchillas to humans. Historical data from rifle noise tests were used to validate the dose-response curves. New chinchilla tests were performed to collect recovery data to construct the TTS recovery model., CONCLUSIONS: Auditory 4.0 is the only model known to date that provides the full TTS and PTS dose-response curves, including a TTS recovery model. The model shows good agreement with historical data.Reprint & Copyright © 2016 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of hearing protection use among attendees of Rock and Roll concerts at baseline and in concerts where earplugs are provided for free at concert venue entrances., DESIGN: Six concerts performed at two music venues in Toronto, Canada were evaluated. Study personnel observed and recorded the use of hearing protection at three concerts where no earplugs were distributed, and three concerts where earplugs were provided for free at the concert venue entrance., STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 955 individuals over the age of 18 were observed at six concerts. Six hundred and thirty-seven individuals (64% male) were observed at concerts where no earplugs were provided, and 318 individuals (68% male) were observed at concerts where free earplugs were provided., RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant increase in hearing protection usage at concerts where earplugs were provided for free at the concert venue entrance, odds ratio 7.27 (95% CI: 3.24-16.30)., CONCLUSION: The provision of free earplugs at concert venues may be a simple and inexpensive intervention that could be a component of a larger public health campaign to prevent non-occupational noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Importance: The incidence of hearing loss has risen in past years. Attendance at music festivals and concerts may contribute to this increasing problem. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of earplugs in preventing temporary hearing loss immediately following music exposure. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A randomized, single-blind clinical trialwas conducted on September 5, 2015, at an outdoor music festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Normal-hearing adult volunteers were recruited via social media. An exclusion criterion was the participants' intention to wear earplugs. Of the 86 volunteers assessed, 51 were included in the study. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Intervention(s): Participants were randomly assigned to a group using earplugs or an unprotected group during a 41/2-hour festival visit. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcomewas a temporary threshold shift (TTS) on the audiogram, primarily for frequencies at 3 and 4 kHz. Secondary study outcomes included distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements and claims of tinnitus using a questionnaire and tinnitus matching experiments. Result(s): Of 51 participants included, 25 were randomized to the earplug group and 26 to the unprotected group. Nine in each group (36% and 35%, respectively) were men, and the mean (SD) ages were 27.3 (5.6) years in the earplug group and 27.0 (6.2) years in the unprotected group. Baseline demographics were similar in both groups. The time-averaged, equivalent A-weighted sound pressure level experienced was 100 dBA during the festival. A TTS over frequencies at 3 and 4 kHz after exposure was seen in 4 of 50 ears (8%) in the earplug group compared with 22 of 52 ears (42%) in the unprotected group (P < .001). The relative risk for a TTS after exposure was 5.3 (95% CI, 2.0-14.3) for the unprotected group vs the earplug group. The number needed to treat with earplugs for preventing 1 TTS was 2.9. The DPOAE amplitudes decreased significantly more over the frequencies 2 to 8 kHz in the unprotected group: the mean (SD) decrease in magnitude was 0.6 (2.8) dB in the earplug group vs 2.2 (1.9) dB in the unprotected group (P = .04). Newly induced tinnitus following sound exposure occurred in 3 of the 25 participants (12%) in the earplug group vs 10 of 25 (40%) in the unprotected group (difference, 28%; 95% CI, 3.6%-49.0%; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: Earplug use is effective in preventing temporary hearing loss after loud music exposure. The present randomized clinical trial adds proof to the scarce evidence and knowledge on this topic, which is a growing global problem.Copyright © 2016 American Medical Association.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the effects of hearing loss, aviation headset type, flight workload complexity, and communication signal quality on pilots' performance in an army rotary-wing flight simulator. To maintain flight status, army aviators who do not meet current audiometric standards require a hearing loss waiver, which is based on speech intelligibility in quiet conditions. Because hearing loss characteristics of hearing-impaired aviators can vary greatly, and because performance is likely also influenced by degree of flight workload and communication demand, it was expected that performance among hearing-impaired aviators would also vary. Participants were 20 army helicopter pilots. Pilots flew three flights in a full motion-based helicopter simulator,with a different headset configuration and varying flight workload levels and communication signal quality characterizing each flight. Objective flight performance parameters of heading, altitude, and airspeed deviation and air traffic control command read-backs were measured. Statistically significant results suggest that high levels of flight workload, especially in combination with poor communications signal quality, lead to deficits in flight performance and speech intelligibility. These results support a conclusion that factors other than hearing thresholds and speech intelligibility in quiet should be considered when evaluating helicopter pilots' flight safety. The results also support a recommendation that hearing-impaired pilots use assistive communication technology and not fly with strictly passive headsets. The combined effects of flight environment with individual hearing levels should be considered when making recommendations concerning continued aviation flight status and those concerning communications headsets used in high-noise cockpits.

AB  - Farm noise exposure is the major cause of noise-induced hearing loss among farmers. Hearing impairment associated with hearing loss, however, may not adequately represent communication handicap and the impact on quality of life. This descriptive correlational study examines the impact of hearing impairment, perceptions and attitudes about hearing loss, and noise exposure risk patterns on hearing handicap among farm family members. A convenience sample of 56 farmers and family members recruited from community-based agricultural events was studied. A hearing impairment was noted in the majority of the participants (80.4%). Fewer than 10 reported regularly wearing protection during work or recreational activities. High-frequency hearing loss in the left ear (F= 10.30, p < .002), the attitude that wearing hearing protection prevents others from getting one's attention (F= 11.90, p < .001), and the self-reported description of hearing (F= 6.66, p < .013) significantly predicted hearing handicap using multiple regression analysis. Farmers and family members do not use hearing protection because they are concerned they will not hear others who are trying to communicate with them. The findings of this study confirm that this attitude, along with hearing loss in the left ear, is associated with a communication handicap in work settings. Although being able to hear others on a day-to-day basis is important, this attitude may contribute to behaviors leading to hearing loss and decreased communication over time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The 2016 National Academies of Sciences report "Hearing Health Care for Adults: Priorities for Improving Access and Affordability" included a call to action for government agencies to strengthen efforts to collect, analyze, and disseminate population-based data on hearing loss in adults., METHODS: CDC analyzed the most recent available data collected both by questionnaire and audiometric tests of adult participants aged 20-69 years in the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine the presence of audiometric notches indicative of noise-induced hearing loss. Prevalence of both unilateral and bilateral audiometric notches and their association with sociodemographics and self-reported exposure to loud noise were calculated., RESULTS: Nearly one in four adults (24%) had audiometric notches, suggesting a high prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss. The prevalence of notches was higher among males. Almost one in four U.S. adults who reported excellent or good hearing had audiometric notches (5.5% bilateral and 18.0% unilateral). Among participants who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had a notch., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant, often unrecognized health problem among U.S. adults. Discussions between patients and personal health care providers about hearing loss symptoms, tests, and ways to protect hearing might help with early diagnosis of hearing loss and provide opportunities to prevent harmful noise exposures. Avoiding prolonged exposure to loud environments and using personal hearing protection devices can prevent noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - We studied the effect of wearing ear protection on 100 children undergoing cast removal. Pulse rate (PR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increases during cast removal were used as physiologic indicators of anxiety. One goal was to determine whether children of various ages are less anxious when wearing ear protection during cast removal. Another goal was to determine whether previous cast removal affects anxiety reactions. Results with children of all ages combined showed that PR increases were significantly lower for those who wore ear protection (P = .04). When wearing ear protection, children up to 6 years old had 9.7% lower PR increases, and 7- to 12-year-olds had 8.8% lower PR increases, but 13- to 17-year-olds had 4.5% higher PR increases. No differences were noted among the groups with respect to MAP increases. There were no significant differences between children who had a cast removed previously and children who were having a cast removed for the first time. Children younger than 13 seemed to benefit the most from wearing ear protection during cast removal.

AB  - A majority of workers in industrial environments must wear hearing protection devices. While these hearing protectors provide increased safety in terms of auditory health, in some conditions they also have the adverse effect of preventing individuals from hearing alarm and warning signals which seriously compromises their safety.Recent advances in the field of microelectronics allow the integration of tiny digital signal processors inside hearing protection devices. This paper develops new algorithms to automatically detect alarm signals in the digitized audio stream fed to the processor. This detection is performed in real-time with low latency to quickly inform the user of a dangerous situation. The algorithms were also optimized to require low computational resources due to the limited processing power of typical embedded electronic devices.The proposed algorithms detect periodicity of the signal amplitude in a determined frequency bandwidth. The system was simulated with a database of alarm signals from a major North-American manufacturer of industrial alarms and warning signals, mixed with typical environmental noises at signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 0 to 15. dBA. The results show an average true-positive recognition rate of 95% for pulsed alarms compliant to the ISO 7331 standard. The system can be optimized for specific alarms which results in near 100% true positive and 0.2% false positive recognition rates. Relevance to industry: Alarms and warning signals are widely use in industry to promptly alert workers of events that can compromise their safety. In practice, however, their efficiency can be dramatically affected by several factors, among which the use of hearing protectors by workers is the most severe. Designing digital hearing protectors with built-in alarms and warning signal detectors may considerably improve the situation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative contributions of tinnitus, asymmetrical hearing loss, low frequency hearing loss (pure tone average of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz; PTA.5123), or high frequency hearing loss (pure tone average of 4, 6 kHz; PTA46), to acute injury risk among a cohort of production and maintenance workers at six aluminum manufacturing plants, adjusting for ambient noise exposure and other recognized predictors of injury risk., DESIGN: Retrospective analysis., STUDY SAMPLE: The study considered 9920 workers employed during 2003 to 2008. The cohort consisted of 8818 workers (89%) whose complete records were available., RESULTS: Adjusting for noise exposure and other recognized injury predictors, a 25% increased acute injury risk was observed among workers with a history of tinnitus in conjunction with high-frequency hearing loss (PTA46). Low frequency hearing loss may be associated with minor, yet less serious, injury risk. We did not find evidence that asymmetry contributes to injury risk., CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that tinnitus, combined with high-frequency hearing loss, may pose an important safety threat to workers, especially those who work in high-noise exposed environments. These at risk workers may require careful examination of their communication and hearing protection needs.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to examine the associations between acute workplace injury risk, ambient noise exposure, and hearing acuity, adjusting for reported hearing protection use. Methods In a cohort of 9220 aluminum manufacturing workers studied over six years (33 300 person-years, 13 323 person-jobs), multivariate mixed effects models were used to estimate relative risk (RR) of all injuries as well as serious injuries by noise exposure category and hearing threshold level (HTL) adjusting for recognized and potential confounders. Results Compared to noise <82 dBA, higher exposure was associated with elevated risk in a monotonic and statistically significant exposure-response pattern for all injuries and serious injuries with higher risk estimates observed for serious injuries [82-84.99 dBA: RR 1.26, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.96-1.64; 85-87.99 dBA: RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05-1.85; >=88 dBA: RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.52-3.47]. Hearing loss was associated with increased risk for all injuries, but was not a significant predictor of risk for the subset of more serious injuries. Compared to those without hearing loss, workers with HTL >=25 dB had 21% increased all injury risk (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.33) while those with HTL 10-24.99 dB had 6% increased risk (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.13). Reported hearing protection type did not predict injury risk. Conclusion Noise exposure levels as low as 85 dBA may increase workplace injury risk. HTL was associated with increased risk for all, but not the subset of serious, injuries. Additional study is needed both to confirm the observed associations and explore causal pathways.Copyright © Scand J Work Environ Health. 2015 All right received.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that solvents such as toluene (Tol) can cause hearing loss and exacerbate the effects of noise on hearing. However, mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effects of co-exposure have not yet been completely elucidated. Studies performed on rats showed that solvents might weaken the membranes of outer hair cells within the organ of Corti; thereby increasing their vulnerability to noise-induced damage. It has also been shown that Tol can inhibit acetylcholine receptors and thus result in reduced ear protective reflexes (EPR). This results from Tol altering the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs). In order to study the prevailing action of solvents in the central nervous system (CNS) compartment involved in the EPR, rats were injected with two VDCC antagonists through the carotid artery: w-conotoxin, which blocks the neuronal N-P/Q-type Ca2+ channels; and verapamil, an inhibitor of the muscular L-type Ca2+ channels. An electrode placed on the round window was used to record the cochlear microphonic potential (CMP) elicited with an 85 dB band noise centered at 4 kHz. The variations in CMP measured during the injections showed that Tol has similar antagonistic effects to those induced by the neu-ronal VDCC blocker w-conotoxin. This phenomenon is significant in terms of occupational safety. In order to facilitate its measurement, a non-invasive hearing testing tool has been developed for both animals and humans. It allows the effects of solvents depressing the CNS response and the effects of noise on the auditory receptor to be measured through recording of distortion product otoacous-tic emissions associated with contralateral noise stimulations. It should allow testing of both the middle-ear and inner-ear functions. Results obtained in animals correlate well with those obtained with CMP monitoring and will be discussed hereafter. Occupational safety and health program for workers will also be discussed.

AB  - Background To estimate the prevalence of workplace noise exposure and use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) at noisy work, NIOSH analyzed 1999-2004 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods A total of'9,275 currently employed workers aged > 16years were included in the weighted analysis. Hazardous workplace noise exposure was defined as self-reported exposure to noise at their current job that was so loud that the respondent had to speakin a raised voice to be heard. Industry and occupation were determined based on the respondent' s current place and type of work. Results Twenty-two million US workers (17%) reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. The weighted prevalence of workplace noise exposure was highest for mining (76%, SE = 7.0) followed by lumber/wood product manufacturing (55%, SE = 2.5). High-risk occupations included repair and maintenance, motor vehicle operators, and construction trades. Overall, 34%% of the estimated 22 million US workers reporting hazardous workplace exposure reported non-use ofHPDs. The proportion ofnoise-exposed workers who reported non-use ofHPDs was highest for healthcare and social services (73.7%, SE = 8.1), followed by educational services (55.5%). Discussion Hearing loss prevention and intervention programs should be targeted at those industries and occupations identified to have a high prevalence of workplace noise exposure and those industries with the highest proportion ofnoise-exposed workers who reported non-use of HPDs.

AB  - In this study the authors investigate the sound pressure levels produced by crying children and discuss the possible adverse effects that direct exposure may impose on a tending guardian or healthcare professional. Sound intensity levels from various pediatric patients (N = 26) were measured under two segregate conditions, one imitating the exposure of an examining physician and the other resembling that of parental guardians. Interestingly, all of the recorded sound levels fell between 99-120 dB(A) of sound pressure; children presenting the greatest risk for intense cries with potentially harmful sound intensities were between the ages of 9 months and 6 years. The authors found that elevated noise levels produced from crying children can cause acute discomfort and mild pain to those exposed. In addition, there is a theoretical risk that chronic exposure to these intense sound pressures may result in noise-induced hearing loss in a parental guardian or an examining physician. Parents of young children may be more likely to succumb to impulsive reactions in attempting to arrest the crying, which could be a precipitating factor for child abuse, responding to physical stress as much as emotional stress. Social workers and medical personnel should consider suggesting the use of ear plugs by parental guardians of frequently crying children as a modality for the prevention of child abuse.

AB  - The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) sponsored tests of three earplug fit-test systems (NIOSH HPD Well-Fit, Michael & Associates FitCheck, and Honeywell Safety Products VeriPRO). Each system was compared to laboratory-based real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements in a sound field according to ANSI/ASA S12.6-2008 at the NIOSH, Honeywell Safety Products, and Michael & Associates testing laboratories. An identical study was conducted independently at the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), which provided their data for inclusion in this article. The Howard Leight Airsoft premolded earplug was tested with twenty subjects at each of the four participating laboratories. The occluded fit of the earplug was maintained during testing with a soundfield-based laboratory REAT system as well as all three headphone-based fit-test systems. The Michael & Associates lab had the highest average A-weighted attenuations and smallest standard deviations. The NIOSH lab had the lowest average attenuations and the largest standard deviations. Differences in octave-band attenuations between each fit-test system and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sound field method were calculated (Attenfit-test - AttenANSI). A-weighted attenuations measured with FitCheck and HPD Well-Fit systems demonstrated approximately +/-2 dB agreement with the ANSI sound field method, but A-weighted attenuations measured with the VeriPRO system underestimated the ANSI laboratory attenuations. For each of the fit-test systems, the average A-weighted attenuation across the four laboratories was not significantly greater than the average of the ANSI sound field method. Standard deviations for residual attenuation differences were about +/-2 dB for FitCheck and HPD Well-Fit compared to +/-4 dB for VeriPRO. Individual labs exhibited a range of agreement from less than a dB to as much as 9.4 dB difference with ANSI and REAT estimates. Factors such as the experience of study participants and test administrators, and the fit-test psychometric tasks are suggested as possible contributors to the observed results.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss is almost always preventable if properly fitted hearing protectors are worn to reduce exposure. Many individuals choose not to wear hearing protection because it may interfere with effective communication in the workplace or it may be uncomfortable. Hearing protector comfort has not received the same amount of attention as noise reduction capability. The present study was conducted to evaluate the comfort level of two different types of insert earplugs as well as the attenuation levels achieved by the earplugs. Attenuation levels were obtained with a commercially available earplug fit-test system, and the comfort ratings were obtained by questionnaire. The primary research objective was to determine whether hearing protector comfort was related to measured attenuation values. A linear mixed effects model provided evidence for an inverse relationship between comfort and attenuation.

AB  - Many farmers and motorsports enthusiasts in rural areas attend tractor pulls, which are loud motorsport competitions using tractors and trucks with powerful, modified engines. The high noise levels experienced by farmers and motorsports fans in their recreational and occupational activities are not addressed by traditional hearing conservation programs. The University of Wisconsin-Madison audiology group has established an annual hearing loss prevention outreach project at the Dairyland Super National Truck and Tractor Pull in Tomah, Wisconsin. The objectives of the outreach are to provide hearing protection to those at the tractor pull, to document tractor pull noise levels, and to encourage tractor pull attendees to use hearing protection at work and in their other recreational activities. This study establishes that hearing loss prevention outreach at tractor pulls is necessary due to the high noise levels during the competitions. The number of earplugs distributed and the percentage of individuals who accept them indicates that this outreach is effective in the short term. It is yet to be determined if this type of hearing loss prevention project can create long-term shifts in cultural attitudes about rural noise and lead to increased hearing protection usage in the occupational and recreational lives of tractor pull attendees.Copyright © Thieme Medical Publishers333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

AB  - Recent results have shown that auditory localization in the horizontal plane is dramatically worse for listeners wearing double hearing protection (earplugs and earmuffs) than it is for listeners wearing single hearing protection (earplugs or earmuffs alone). This suggests that double hearing protection might also impair the spatial unmasking that normally occurs when two simultaneous talkers are spatially separated in azimuth (the so-called "cocktail party" effect). In this experiment, normal hearing listeners wearing no hearing protection, single hearing protection (earmuffs), or double hearing protection were asked to perform a speech intelligibility task that required them to segregate two simultaneous talkers who were either presented from the same loudspeaker or spatially separated by 90degree in azimuth. The listeners were also asked to determine the location of the target talker in each trial. The results show that the listeners were unable to reliably determine the location of the target talker when they wore double hearing protection, but that they were still able to benefit from the spatial separation of the competing talkers. This suggests that the use of double hearing protection causes spatially separated sound sources to be heard at locations that are inaccurate but still distinct enough to enhance the segregation of speech.

AB  - The human eye lens appears to be more radiosensitive than previously assumed. The reduction of the limit for the dose to the lens of the eye to 20 mSv per year has been passed in the current Euratom Directives (2013). Therefore, in this work the impact of laboratory glasses and X-ray protective goggles was investigated and reciprocal attenuation factors (i.e. transmission factors) for different nuclides (Tc-99m, I-131, Y-90, F-18 and Ga-68) were determined. The radionuclides in typical geometry (syringe, applicator) were positioned at a distance of 50 cm to the eyes of four Alderson-Head-Phantoms. Different dosemeters measuring Hp(3) respective Hp(0.07) were fixed to the eyes of the phantoms, either behind the glasses or without any protection means, respectively. The mean reciprocal attenuation factors were determined to be between unity for F-18 and I-131 using laboratory glasses (no attenuation effect) and < 0.01 for Y-90 using X-ray protective goggles. All other results were between these extremes. It has been shown, that prospective doses to the lens of the eye can be reduced significantly by using appropriate radiation protection means, especially for those dose-relevant beta radiation emitting nuclides such as Y-90.Copyright © 2015

AB  - Hearing protection devices (HPDs) such as earplugs offer to mitigate noise exposure and reduce the incidence of hearing loss among persons frequently exposed to intense sound. However, distortions of spatial acoustic information and reduced audibility of low-intensity sounds caused by many existing HPDs can make their use untenable in high-risk (e.g., military or law enforcement) environments where auditory situational awareness is imperative. Here we assessed (1) sound source localization accuracy using a head-turning paradigm, (2) speech-in-noise recognition using a modified version of the QuickSIN test, and (3) tone detection thresholds using a two-alternative forced-choice task. Subjects were 10 young normal-hearing males. Four different HPDs were tested (two active, two passive), including two new and previously untested devices. Relative to unoccluded (control) performance, all tested HPDs significantly degraded performance across tasks, although one active HPD slightly improved high-frequency tone detection thresholds and did not degrade speech recognition. Behavioral data were examined with respect to head-related transfer functions measured using a binaural manikin with and without tested HPDs in place. Data reinforce previous reports that HPDs significantly compromise a variety of auditory perceptual facilities, particularly sound localization due to distortions of high-frequency spectral cues that are important for the avoidance of front-back confusions.Copyright © 2015 Brown et al.

AB  - Auditory deprivation and stimulation can change the threshold of the acoustic reflex, but the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. In order to elucidate the mechanism, we sought to characterize the time-course as well as the frequency specificity of changes in acoustic reflex thresholds (ARTs). In addition, we compared ipsilateral and contralateral measurements because the pattern of findings may shed light on the anatomical location of the change in neural gain. Twenty-four normal-hearing adults wore an earplug continuously in one ear for six days. We measured ipsilateral and contralateral ARTs in both ears on six occasions (baseline, after 2, 4 and 6 days of earplug use, and 4 and 24 h after earplug removal), using pure tones at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz and a broadband noise stimulus, and an experimenter-blinded design. We found that ipsi- as well as contralateral ARTs were obtained at a lower sound pressure level after earplug use, but only when the reflex was elicited by stimulating the treatment ear. Changes in contralateral ARTs were not the same as changes in ipsilateral ARTs when the stimulus was presented to the control ear. Changes in ARTs were present after 2 days of earplug use, and reached statistical significance after 4 days, when the ipsilateral and contralateral ARTs were measured in the treatment ear. The greatest changes in ARTs occurred at 2 and 4 kHz, the frequencies most attenuated by the earplug. After removal of the earplug, ARTs started to return to baseline relatively quickly, and were not significantly different from baseline by 4-24 h. There was a trend for the recovery to occur quicker than the onset. The changes in ARTs are consistent with a frequency-specific gain control mechanism operating around the level of the ventral cochlear nucleus in the treatment ear, on a time scale of hours to days. These findings, specifically the time course of change, could be applicable to other sensory systems, which have also shown evidence of a neural gain control mechanism.Copyright © 2016

AB  - Background: Acute hospitalization can precipitate transient and short-term insomnia in patients, triggering the prescription of sedative hypnotics. Illness, medications, change in nighttime routine, & the sleep-disruptive nature of the hospital environment can cause insomnia. Both insomnia and the drugs used to treat it can contribute to delirium, a risk factor for falls, restraint use, increased length of stay, & increased incidence of hospital complications. Poor sleep can lead to decreased patient satisfaction. In a recent study, hospitalized older adults were treated with a non-pharmacologic nurse-driven sleep protocol, which led to a decrease in the use of sedative-hypnotic medications, & an improvement in quality of sleep. We undertook a quality improvement project with the objective to use low cost, non-pharmacological methods to improve sleep & patient experience, and reduce zolpidem use & falls. Method(s): Using a pilot medicine unit, we established a core team of geriatricians, hospitalists, nurses, pharmacists, music therapists, & house staff. We trained them with project-specific educational material & hung posters on the unit. On admission, we gave patients welcome bags with headphones, eye mask, earplugs, & literature on the project. We instituted quiet hours (10PM to 6AM) with team buy-in to minimize v/s checks & blood draws. We offered music therapy and interventions to improve night time comfort, such as warm blankets, warm milk & tea. As an alternative to sedative-hypnotics, we introduced melatonin to the hospital formulary. We administered a 5-question sleep survey to 125 patients pre- and post-intervention, and performed ongoing analysis of the unit's HCAHPS scores, zolpidem prescribing patterns & fall rate. Result(s): Our intervention led to a significant improvement in the mean quality of sleep (2.8 vs. 3.34 post; scale 1-5, P= 0.0003). HCAHPS scores had improving trends in four relevant categories, including quietness of the environment. Zolpidem orders trended down. There was no significant difference in fall rate, however the unit baseline is low (2-4/month). There was no significant difference in the mean times woken (2.16 vs 2.12 post). Conclusion(s): Project Sleep demonstrates that, with staff engagement, low cost, easily available interventions can improve quality of sleep & patient experience while avoiding zolpidem use.

AB  - An adaptive, delayless, subband feed-forward control structure is employed to improve the speech signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the communication channel of a circumaural headset/hearing protector (HPD) from 90Hz to 11.3kHz, and to provide active noise control (ANC) from 50 to 800Hz to complement the passive attenuation of the HPD. The task involves optimizing the speech SNR for each communication channel subband, subject to limiting the maximum sound level at the ear, maintaining a speech SNR preferred by users, and reducing large inter-band gain differences to improve speech quality. The performance of a proof-of-concept device has been evaluated in a pseudo-diffuse sound field when worn by human subjects under conditions of environmental noise and speech that do not pose a risk to hearing, and by simulation for other conditions. For the environmental noises employed in this study, subband speech SNR control combined with subband ANC produced greater improvement in word scores than subband ANC alone, and improved the consistency of word scores across subjects. The simulation employed a subject-specific linear model, and predicted that word scores are maintained in excess of 90% for sound levels outside the HPD of up to ~115 dBA.

AB  - Noise is omnipresent and impacts us all in many aspects of daily living. Noise can interfere with communication not only in industrial workplaces, but also in other work settings (e.g. open-plan offices, construction, and mining) and within buildings (e.g. residences, arenas, and schools). The interference of noise with communication can have significant social consequences, especially for persons with hearing loss, and may compromise safety (e.g. failure to perceive auditory warning signals), influence worker productivity and learning in children, affect health (e.g. vocal pathology, noise-induced hearing loss), compromise speech privacy, and impact social participation by the elderly. For workers, attempts have been made to: 1) Better define the auditory performance needed to function effectively and to directly measure these abilities when assessing Auditory Fitness for Duty, 2) design hearing protection devices that can improve speech understanding while offering adequate protection against loud noises, and 3) improve speech privacy in open-plan offices. As the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the effects of noise, an understanding of the interplay between auditory, cognitive, and social factors and its effect on speech communication and social participation is also critical. Classroom acoustics and speech intelligibility in children have also gained renewed interest because of the importance of effective speech comprehension in noise on learning. Finally, substantial work has been made in developing models aimed at better predicting speech intelligibility. Despite progress in various fields, the design of alarm signals continues to lag behind advancements in knowledge. This summary of the last three years' research highlights some of the most recent issues for the workplace, for older adults, and for children, as well as the effectiveness of warning sounds and models for predicting speech intelligibility. Suggestions for future work are also discussed.

AB  - This paper compares different approaches to model the vibroacoustic behavior of earmuffs at low frequency and investigates their accuracy by comparison with objective insertion loss measurements recently carried out by Boyer et al. [(2014). Appl. Acoust. 83, 76-85]. Two models based on the finite element (FE) method where the cushion is either modeled as a spring foundation (SF) or as an equivalent solid (ES), and the well-known lumped parameters model (LPM) are investigated. Modeling results show that: (i) all modeling strategies are in good agreement with measurements, providing that the characterization of the cushion equivalent mechanical properties are performed with great care and as close as possible to in situ loading, boundary, and environmental conditions and that the frequency dependence of the mechanical properties is taken into account, (ii) the LPM is the most simple modeling strategy, but the air volume enclosed by the earmuff must be correctly estimated, which is not as straightforward as it may seem, (iii) similar results are obtained with the SF and the ES FE-models of the cushion, but the SF should be preferred to predict the earmuff acoustic response at low frequency since it requires less parameters and a less complex characterization procedure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Speech production in noise with varying talker-to-listener distance has been well studied for the open ear condition. However, occluding the ear canal can affect the auditory feedback and cause deviations from the models presented for the open-ear condition. Communication is a main concern for people wearing hearing protection devices (HPD). Although practical, radio communication is cumbersome, as it does not distinguish designated receivers. A smarter radio communication protocol must be developed to alleviate this problem. Thus, it is necessary to model speech production in noise while wearing HPDs. Such a model opens the door to radio communication systems that distinguish receivers and offer more efficient communication between persons wearing HPDs., DESIGN: This paper presents the results of a pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of occluding the ear on changes in voice level and fundamental frequency in noise and with varying talker-to-listener distance., STUDY SAMPLE: Twelve participants with a mean age of 28 participated in this study., RESULTS: Compared to existing data, results show a trend similar to the open ear condition with the exception of the occluded quiet condition., CONCLUSIONS: This implies that a model can be developed to better understand speech production for the occluded ear.

AB  - Results: This article proposes models that can predict the difference in speech level as a function of background noise level and talker-to-listener distance for occluded talkers. The proposed model complements the existing model presented by Pelegrin-Garcia, Smits, Brunskog, and Jeong (2011) and expands on it by taking into account the effects of occlusion and background noise level on changes in speech sound level., Conclusions: Three models of the relationship between vocal effort, background noise level, and talker-to-listener distance for talkers wearing HPDs are presented. The model with the best prediction intervals is a talker-dependent model that requires the users' unoccluded speech level at 10 m as a reference. A model describing the relationship between speech level, talker-to-listener distance, and background noise level for occluded talkers could eventually be incorporated with radio protocols to transmit verbal communication only to an intended set of listeners within a given spatial range-this range being dependent on the changes in speech level and background noise level., Purpose: Studying the variations in speech levels with changing background noise level and talker-to-listener distance for talkers wearing hearing protection devices (HPDs) can aid in understanding communication in background noise., Method: Speech was recorded using an intra-aural HPD from 12 different talkers at 5 different distances in 3 different noise conditions and 2 quiet conditions.

AB  - Background: Irregular breathing causing hypoxia and bradycardia is a common problem of preterm infants but its pathophysiology is incompletely understood. Agitation provoked by environmental noise may play a role. We wanted to know if earmuffs can at least halve the rate of intermittent hypoxia in premies. Patients and Methods: In this randomized controlled trial 31 infants (14 male; median [min.-max.] birth weight and gestational age: 1323g [560-1990] and 301/7 weeks [255/7-330/7]) had the effect of earmuffs on the frequency of pulse oximeter desaturations (SpO2 <80%) and bradycardia events (<80 beats per minute) tested, documented via a standard home monitor. Infants were measured 2h each with or without earmuffs; the sequence of intervention was randomised. Measurement conditions were kept constant while a noise meter recorded sound pressure levels at a 1Hz sampling rate. Result(s): Median sound pressure level was 46.8dBA. In a pre-study, ear muffs yielded a sound reduction by 7.2dB. 19 infants had a total of 474 desaturations. The median (25.-75. percentile) number of desaturations was 1 (1-10.5) without, and 1 (1-10) with earmuffs. The amount of infants with at least one desaturation was equal in both treatment protocols. Only 7 bradycardias occurred. Conclusion(s): The earmuffs had, in a rather quiet environment, no effect on intermittent hypoxia in these infants.Copyright © 2015 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.New York.

AB  - Exposure to high-intensity impulse noise from the recreational use of firearms is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although recreational firearm users who shoot firearms without proper hearing protection are at risk for NIHL, a specific subgroup involved in hunting waterfowl may also be at risk due to their particular shooting habits. The goal of the present study was to investigate the shooting habits of this particular group of U.S. recreational firearm users. A 23-item written survey was sent to waterfowl hunting club members regarding their shooting behaviors, use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), and auditory status. Results indicated that waterfowl hunters in this study typically used large bore semiautomatic shotguns, did not consistently utilize HPDs during target practice or hunting and were exposed to multiple, unprotected shots during the past waterfowl season. Most subjects reported hunting in reverberant acoustic environments (hunting blinds). This group of recreational firearm users also reported high incidences of hearing loss and tinnitus. Information provided by this study may help hearing conservationists and hearing healthcare providers understand and better educate these shooters regarding the risk of acquiring NIHL.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible associations between college students' attitudes, risk-taking behaviour related to noisy activities, and hearing problems such as threshold shifts or self-experienced hearing symptoms. The sample included 258 students aged between 17 and 21 enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. A questionnaire measuring attitudes towards noise, use of hearing protection, and self-reported hearing symptoms was distributed among the students. After completing the questionnaire a hearing screening, including pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry, was conducted. The result revealed that 26% had thresholds poorer than the screening level of 20 dBHL. Attitudes were significantly related to self-experienced hearing symptoms, but not to threshold shifts. Attitudes and noise sensitivity was, significantly related to use of hearing protection. Hearing protection use was found in activities such as using firearms, mowing lawns, and when using noisy tools but was less reported for concerts and discotheques. It can be concluded that the young adults in this study expose themselves to hearing risks, since the use of hearing protection is in general very low. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Recreational music exposure is a potential risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Augmented hearing protectors have been designed with modified attenuation characteristics to combine hearing protection and listening comfort. However, to date, only a few independent studies have assessed the performance of those augmented protectors in realistic exposure conditions. This study compares the listening experience and temporary effects on cochlear status with different types of earplugs after exposure to contemporary club music. Five different types of commercially available hearing protectors were worn, all commonly used during leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented premolded earplugs and the fifth type was an inexpensive, standard earplug frequently distributed for free at music events. During five different test sessions of 30 min each, participants not professionally involved in music wore one particular type of protector. Contemporary club music was played at sound pressure levels (SPLs) representative of concerts and bars. After each listening session, a questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation was completed. In addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured directly before and after music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly differed depending on the addressed characteristics and the specific earplug type. In this test group, the reported appreciation mainly depended on comfort and looks, while differences in sound quality were less noticeable. The changes in OAE amplitude before and after noise exposure were small in terms of clinical standards. Nevertheless, the observed temporary shifts differed systematically for the different types of hearing protectors, with two types of musician earplug showing a more systematic decline than the others. Further research with respect to actual use and achieved protection for real, unsupervised music exposure is warranted.

AB  - Personal hearing protectors are widely used to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss. These devices have to be worn both correctly and consistently while exposed to noise, therefore substantial research has been devoted to barriers and opportunities associated with effective hearing conservation.The current paper focuses on the company's hearing conservation approach to identify from a practical point of view major policy aspects that can stimulate effective hearing conservation and are also feasible within a real industrial context. In four companies from different branches of industry, surveys have been carried out among safety advisors and workers to asses the companies' hearing conservation program from both perspectives and relate it to reported use of hearing protectors.The findings highlight the benefits of strict policy: reported consistent wearing is much higher in the establishment where actual control and even sanctions are in place. Workers' risk perception of noise levels at the work floor is also found to be important, but less associated with final use than the safety culture. Finally, the safety climate reported by safety advisors corresponds closely to the workers' perception, suggesting that (adequate) policy making can get really through to daily working routines. These findings stress once more the managements' responsibilities and opportunities to create a healthy occupational environment. Relevance to industry: As stated in this abstract, the current findings are very relevant for industry because they identify the major influential factors for use of hearing protection at the work floor. This way, the results can serve as a base and inspiration for focused hearing conservation programs, improving the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss with effective efforts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study aimed to conduct an ergonomic intervention on a conventional line (CL) in a semiconductor factory in Malaysia, an industrially developing country (IDC), to improve workers' occupational health and safety (OHS). Low-cost and simple (LCS) ergonomics methods were used (suitable for IDCs), e.g., subjective assessment, direct observation, use of archival data and assessment of noise. It was found that workers were facing noise irritation, neck and back pains and headache in the various processes in the CL. LCS ergonomic interventions to rectify the problems included installing noise insulating covers, providing earplugs, installing elevated platforms, slanting visual display terminals and installing extra exhaust fans. The interventions cost less than 3 000 USD but they significantly improved workers' OHS, which directly correlated with an improvement in working conditions and job satisfaction. The findings are useful in solving OHS problems in electronics industries in IDCs as they share similar manufacturing processes, problems and limitations.

AB  - In order to preserve their operational effectiveness and ultimately their survival, military personnel must be able to detect important acoustic signals and maintain situational awareness. The possession of sufficient hearing ability to perform job-specific auditory tasks is defined as auditory fitness for duty (AFFD). Pure tone audiometry (PTA) is used to assess AFFD in the UK military; however, it is unclear whether PTA is able to accurately predict performance on job-specific auditory tasks. The aim of the current study was to gather information about auditory tasks carried out by infantry personnel on the frontline and the environment these tasks are performed in. The study consisted of 16 focus group interviews with an average of five participants per group. Eighty British army personnel were recruited from five infantry regiments. The focus group guideline included seven open-ended questions designed to elicit information about the auditory tasks performed on operational duty. Content analysis of the data resulted in two main themes: (1) the auditory tasks personnel are expected to perform and (2) situations where personnel felt their hearing ability was reduced. Auditory tasks were divided into subthemes of sound detection, speech communication and sound localization. Reasons for reduced performance included background noise, hearing protection and attention difficulties. The current study provided an important and novel insight to the complex auditory environment experienced by British infantry personnel and identified 17 auditory tasks carried out by personnel on operational duties. These auditory tasks will be used to inform the development of a functional AFFD test for infantry personnel.

AB  - Aim of the study: To estimate hearing loss of game wardens exposed to firearm impulse noise and to compare it with a refe-rence population. Method(s): All game wardens were asked to attend a medical examination completed by a questionnaire on noise exposure, the factors of risk associated and an audio-metry at various frequencies: 3 kHz, 4 kHz and 6 kHz. The deafness Early Warning Indicator (EWI) was compared to that of a reference population described in French standards. Result(s): The participation rate was 72.0% (n = 857). The mean and median (M) EWI in the 2 ears of otologically normal subjects (n = 755) were 27,5 dB and 23,3 dB. In the game warden population, the EWI was higher in the left ear (M = 25,0 dB) than in the right ear (M = 20,0 dB) (p < 10 -4). The EWI in one or both of the game wardens'ears were always higher than in the reference population (p < 0.05). Shooting instructors did not present increased hearing loss compared to game wardens. The use of hearing protective devices during shooting was associated with decreased hearing loss in game wardens with a duration of employment >= 10 years. Conclusion(s): Game wardens presented more severe hearing loss than the general population, justifying collective and individual prevention. © 2006. Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that the reliability of using laboratory measurements to predict individual or even group hearing protector attenuation for occupationally exposed workers is quite poor. This makes it difficult to properly assign hearing protectors when one wishes to closely match attenuation to actual exposure. An alternative is the use of field-measurement methods, a number of which have been proposed and are beginning to be implemented. We examine one of those methods, namely the field microphone-in-real-ear (F-MIRE) approach in which a dual-element microphone probe is used to measure noise reduction by quickly sampling the difference in noise levels outside and under an earplug, with appropriate adjustments to predict real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT). We report on experiments that validate the ability of one commercially available F-MIRE device to predict the REAT of an earplug fitted identically for two tests. Results are reported on a representative roll-down foam earplug, stemmed-style pod plug, and pre-molded earplug, demonstrating that the 95% confidence level of the Personal Attenuation Rating (PAR) as a function of the number of fits varies from +/- 4.4 dB to +/- 6.3 dB, depending on the plug type, which can be reduced to +/- 3.1 dB to +/- 4.5 dB with a single repeat measurement. The added measurement improves precision substantially. However, the largest portion of the error is due to the user's fitting variability and not the uncertainty of the measurement system. Further we evaluated the inherent uncertainty of F-MIRE vs. the putative "gold standard" REAT procedures finding, that F-MIRE measurement uncertainty is less than one-half that of REAT at most test frequencies. An American National Standards Institute (ANSI) working group (S12/WG11) is currently involved in developing methods similar to those in this paper so that procedures for evaluating and reporting uncertainty on all types of field attenuation measurement systems can be standardized. We conclude that the hearing conservationist now has available a portable, convenient, quick, and easy-to-use system that can improve training and motivation of employees, assign hearing protection devices based on noise exposures, and address other management and compliance issues.

AB  - Occupational Noise exposure has been linked with a range of negative health effects by various researchers. The resulting injury of occupational hearing loss is also a well recognized and global problem. To protect workers from hearing damage due to noise exposure and other related health effects, a vast store of knowledge has been accumulated till date about its nature, etiology and time course. There is still ignorance, amongst majority of people working in industries in developing and third world countries including India about ill effects of exposure to high values of noise. The study being reported here has been carried out in two textile plants located in Northern Indian state of Punjab. Equivalent sound pressure level Leq, has been measured in various sections of these plants with the help of a Class-I type digital sound level meter. The noise spectrum has been evaluated with the help of 1/3 octave filter set. A cross sectional study involving 112 workers exposed to different levels of occupational noise has been conducted. The results of the study establish the fact that noise level in certain sections of the plants i.e Loom Shed, Spinning, Ring Frame, TFO Area is more than the acceptable limit of 90 dBA for 8 h exposure stipulated by OSHA. The noise level in other sections like carding, blow room, combing etc., although is less than 90 dB(A), but is quite higher than limits used for assessment of noise for community response. Octave band analysis of the noise shows the presence of high sound level in 4,000 Hz frequency range, which can be a major reason for causing occupational hearing loss. The results of the interview questionnaire which included a number of parameters reveal the following; (i) only 29% workers are aware about the effects of noise on health (ii) 28% workers are using ear protectors (iii) the satisfaction with the working environment is related to noise level, as workers exposed to comparatively less noise level report better satisfaction (iv) 70% of the workers reported that high noise level causes speech interference (v) 42% workers report the noise to be annoying. The study thus demonstrates the presence of gross occupational noise exposure in both the plants and the author believes that occupational noise exposure and the related effects in India is a widespread problem.

AB  - The use of earplugs in loud music venues is confined to a small minority who wish to avoid hearing damage from excessive noise exposure. Using the framework of the health belief model (HBM), structured interviews were held with 20 earplug-wearing clubbers. Qualitative analysis revealed the HBM constructs relevant to understanding this group's motivation to protect their hearing. Personal experience of noise injury symptoms was the most common cue triggering earplug use. Awareness of the benefits of earplugs and appreciation of the long-term implications of hearing damage, affinity for music and high self-efficacy were also key variables underlying this health behaviour.

Responsibility for hearing protection is largely left to individuals, many of whom choose not to wear earplugs. In order to encourage earplug use in these settings, a new approach is needed. The aim of the study was to examine whether presentation of hearing health information would result in increased use of earplugs, or whether provision of earplugs alone would be sufficient to change behaviour. A total of 51 regular patrons of music venues were allocated to either a low-information (lo-info) or high-information (hi-info) group. Both groups completed a survey about their current noise exposure, earplug usage and perceived risk of hearing damage. Both groups were also provided with one-size-fits-all filtered music earplugs. The hi-info group was also provided with audio-visual and written information about the risks of excessive noise exposure. After 4 weeks, and again after an additional 12 weeks, participants were asked about their recent earplug usage, intention to use earplugs in the future, and perceived risk of hearing damage. The results showed that after 4 weeks, the hi-info group's perceived personal risk of hearing damage was significantly higher than that of the lo-info group. After 16 weeks, these differences were no longer evident; however, at both 4 and 16 weeks, both the lo- and hi-info groups were using the earplugs equally often; and both groups intended to use earplugs significantly more often in the future. This suggests that the information was unnecessary to motivate behavioural change. Rather, the simple act of providing access to earplugs appears to have effectively encouraged young at-risk adults to increase their earplug use. Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) at work is widespread and well researched, but less is known about HPD use in high-noise leisure activities. We investigated HPD use of 8,144 Australians in leisure settings. An online survey asked questions about HPD use at work and leisure and examined whether age, gender, HPD use at work, and tinnitus predicted HPD use in leisure activities. Leisure-based HPD use was most common during high-risk work-related activities. Use of HPDs at work was the most significant predictor of leisure-based use, with workplace users up to 5 times more likely to use HPDs at leisure. Men were significantly more likely than women to use HPDs in 10/20 leisure activities, and those with tinnitus were more likely than those without to use HPDs in 8/20 activities. Older participants were more likely to use HPDs at nightclubs and concerts, but younger participants were more likely to use HPDs playing e-games and musical instruments.Copyright © 2016 Crown copyright.

AB  - Noise in most working environments is an unwanted by-product of the process. In most countries, noise exposure for workers has been controlled by legislation for many years. In the music industry the "noise" is actually the "desired" product, and for a long time the UK entertainment industry was exempt from these regulations. From April 2008, however, it became regulated under the Noise at Work Regulations 2005, meaning that employers from orchestras to nightclubs are legally required to adhere to the same requirements (based on ISO 9612:2009) for controlling noise exposure for their staff that have been applied to other industries for many years. A key question is to what degree, 2 years after implementation, these employers are complying with their legal responsibilities to protect the staff from noise? This study assessed four public music venues where live and/or recorded music is regularly played. Thirty staff members in different roles in the venues were monitored using noise dosimetry to determine noise exposure. Questionnaires were used to determine work patterns, attitudes to noise and hearing loss, and levels of training about noise risk. Results showed that the majority of staff (70%) in all venues exceeded the daily noise exposure limit value in their working shift. Use of hearing protection was rare (<30%) and not enforced by most venues. The understanding of the hazard posed by noise was low, and implementation of the noise regulations was haphazard, with staff regularly exceeding regulatory limits. The implication is that the industry is failing to meet regulatory requirements.

AB  - In the civil construction industry sector, it has been observed that the increasing use of machines has made tasks noisier and consequently caused hearing loss and had other adverse effects on workers. The objective of this study was to identify and assess the physical risks of noise present in activities undertaken in a construction company in order to propose control measures which will contribute to the management of health and safety within the company's organization. The methodology applied was based on verifying the characteristics of exposure to noise on construction sites, from an observation of sources which generated noise and making measurements of sound pressure levels emitted by these sources. The data was then analyzed and compared with the recommended performance levels established in control measures. As a result, it was found that some machines and equipment used in civil construction often generate noise above the acceptable levels and as such, in these cases, various control measures have been proposed. It is believed that the use of management techniques is the most effective way to assess risk and to implement the preventive and corrective actions proposed, and allows for the analysis of sound pressure levels on an ongoing basis.

AB  - Background. To determine levels of exposure to noise during urgent medical transportation by road and to describe the perception of hearing function impairment in workers and the use of hearing protection devices. Material and methods. An observational study was performed in Bizkaia (Spain). The instantaneous maximum noise levels (Lpeak) and its continuous equivalents (Leq) were recorded through sonometric dosimetries, measured in a "sample ambulance" of the emergency network. In parallel, a survey was conducted on a representative sample of 127 workers in which self-reported hearing loss and associated factors were explored, in addition to other issues of concern from the perspective of prevention of occupational hazards. Results. Lpeak oscillating between 80 and 109 dBA were recorded depending on the location. The average Leq levels measured over 10 emergency calls, from activation until arrival at the incident and during transport to the hospital, were of 79.5 dBA and 74.3 dBA (p <0.001) respectively. Thirty-six point two percent of the surveyed workers spoke of hearing impairment in recent years. The independent variables associated with increased risk were: age over 45 years, professional seniority over 15 years and male gender. The strategies used to mitigate the siren's noise during the emergency were closing the windows of the ambulance and using the dimmer at night. Conclusions. The values of the dosimetries do not exceed the critical values provided, but there is a high prevalence of hearing-impaired problems reported by the workers. Emphasis should be placed on the adoption of strategies to reduce noise and its effects on the ambulance service.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the attitude toward noise, perceived hearing symptoms, noisy activities that were participated in, and factors associated with hearing protection use among college students. A 44-item online survey was completed by 2,151 college students (aged 17 years and above) to assess the attitudes toward noise, perceived hearing symptoms related to noise exposure, and use of hearing protection around noisy activities. Among the participants, 39.6% experienced at least one hearing symptom, with ear pain as the most frequently reported (22.5%). About 80% of the participants were involved in at least one noise activity, out of which 41% reported the use of hearing protection. A large majority of those with ear pain, hearing loss, permanent tinnitus, and noise sensitivity was involved in attending a sporting event, which was the most reported noisy activity. The highest reported hearing protection use was in the use of firearms, and the lowest in discos/ dances. The reported use of hearing protection is associated with having at least one hearing symptom but the relationship is stronger with tinnitus, hearing loss, and ear pain (chi2 = 30.5-43.5, P< 0.01) as compared to noise sensitivity (chi2 = 3.8, P= 0.03); it is also associated with anti-noise attitudes, particularly in youth social events. Universities and colleges have important roles in protecting young adults' hearing by integrating hearing conservation topic in the college curriculum, promoting hearing health by student health services, involving student groups in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) awareness and prevention, and establishing noise level limitations for all on-campus events.

AB  - Sound pressure levels were measured within an MR scan room for a range of sequences employed in veterinary brain scanning, using a test phantom in an extremity coil. Variation of TR and TE, and use of a quieter gradient mode ('whisper' mode) were evaluated to determine their effect on sound pressure levels (SPLs). Use of a human head coil and a human brain sequence was also evaluated. Significant differences in SPL were achieved for T2, T1, T2* gradient echo and VIBE sequences by varying TR or TE, or by selecting the 'whisper' gradient mode. An appreciable reduction was achieved for the FLAIR sequence. Noise levels were not affected when a head coil was used in place of an extremity coil. Due to sequence parameters employed, veterinary patients and anaesthetists may be exposed to higher sound levels than those experienced in human MR examinations. The techniques described are particularly valuable in small animal MR scanning where ear protection is not routinely provided for the patient. © 2012 The College of Radiographers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is some evidence to suggest that safety on small-area farms may not be high priority due to economic constraints and lack of knowledge. This has important ramifications for injury and economic burden. The objective of this research was to conduct a pilot study to investigate whether small- to medium-area farms implement fewer safety practices than large-area farms., METHODS: Farmers were recruited from farm safety training days, field days, and produce stores in rural New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Small- and medium-area farms less than 500 ha (1235 acres) in size were aggregated for analysis and compared with large-area farms (>=500 ha) for survey items, including safety equipment owned and used, safety practices protecting children, barriers to improving safety, and causes of injury., RESULTS: Overall, small/medium-area farms were found to own less safety equipment and to employ less safety practices than large-area farms. In particular, fewer tractors were fitted with rollover protection structures, there was less signage, less hearing protection, and fewer machinery guides. Injury rates were slightly less for small/medium-area farms, particularly involving vehicles. Small- and medium-area farmers were more likely to report lack of skills as barriers to making safety improvements., CONCLUSION: This pilot study found some evidence that small/medium-area farms implement fewer safety practices than large-area farms. A larger study is warranted to investigate this further, with particular focus on barriers and ways to overcome them. This could have important ramifications for government policies supporting struggling farmers on small/medium-area farms.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: Otosclerosis is a disorder that impairs middle ear function, leading to conductive hearing loss. Surgical treatment results in large improvement of hearing at low sound frequencies, but high-frequency hearing often suffers. A likely reason for this is that inner ear sensory cells are damaged by surgical trauma and loud sounds generated during the operation. Animal studies have shown that antioxidants such as N-Acetylcysteine can protect the inner ear from noise, surgical trauma, and some ototoxic substances, but it is not known if this works in humans. This trial was performed to determine whether antioxidants improve surgical results at high frequencies. Method(s): We performed a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial at three Swedish university clinics. Using block-stratified randomization, 156 adult patients undergoing stapedotomy were assigned to intravenous N-Acetylcysteine (150 mg/kg body weight) or matching placebo (1:1 ratio), starting one hour before surgery. The primary outcome was the hearing threshold at 6 and 8 kHz; secondary outcomes included the severity of tinnitus and vertigo. Finding(s): One year after surgery, high-frequency hearing had improved 2.7 +/- 3.8 dB in the placebo group (67 patients analysed) and 2.4 +/- 3.7 dB in the treated group (72 patients; means +/-95% confidence interval, p = 0.54; linear mixed model). Surgery improved tinnitus, but there was no significant intergroup difference. Post-operative balance disturbance was common but improved during the first year, without significant difference between groups. Four patients receiving N-Acetylcysteine experienced mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Conclusion(s): N-Acetylcysteine has no effect on hearing thresholds, tinnitus, or balance disturbance after stapedotomy.

AB  - Background: There is limited research on the role of dysfunctional/ irrational thinking processes and immigration status on hearing protection device (HPD) usage. Purpose(s): The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of low frustration tolerance (LFT) and immigration status on HPD usage among employees exposed to hazardous industrial noise. Method(s): A total of 117 Israeli-borns and 80 new immigrants from former Soviet Union completed a questionnaire. The association between HPD usage and barriers to action, self-efficacy, and LFT (accounting for age, years of exposure, and immigration status) were assessed using ordered logistic regression models. Result(s): LFT was associated negatively (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = .25, 95%; confidence interval [CI] = .15-.41) with HPD usage. Self-efficacy was a modifier (adjusted OR = 1.47, 95%; CI = 1.34-1.63): the higher the self-efficacy for a given LFT level, the higher the extent of HPD usage. Immigration status was not a significant predictor. Conclusion(s): HPD usage is associated with both rational and irrational motivations. The role of LFT in hearing protection should be further investigated. © 2006 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hearing loss prevention has always been an important issue for audiologists. The importance of hearing loss prevention education for young musicians is now recognized by the National Association for Music Education as well as the National Association of Schools of Music. Adopt-a-Band is a commercial program designed to foster hearing loss prevention behavior in young musicians., METHOD: This study assessed changes in earplug use, measured using self-report surveys, after Adopt-a-Band training. Participants were members of 2 high school marching bands who viewed an informational DVD and reviewed fact sheets. Flat-attenuation earplugs were distributed, and training was provided. In addition, study participants engaged in discussion of hearing loss with a doctor of audiology student., RESULTS: Before training, 23% of participants reported they had previously used hearing protection. Immediately after training, 94% of participants reported they planned to use hearing protection at least occasionally. In a final end-of-season survey, earplug use had reliably increased; 62% of participants reported they used earplugs at least occasionally., CONCLUSIONS: Earplug use increased, but self-reported behavioral change was not as robust as predicted from self-reported participant intentions. Participant comments regarding factors that influenced their earplug use decisions suggest opportunities to improve training.

AB  - Context and Objective: Noise-induced hearing loss can only be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. When the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. The aim here was to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among workers exposed to noise in the workplace. Data Source: Studies with random assignment were identified by an electronic search of the medical literature up to 2005. Data were double-entered into the Review Manager software, version 4.2.5. Data Synthesis: Two studies were found. A computer-based intervention tailored to individual workers risks and lasting 30 minutes was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information for workers. A second randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a four-year school-based hearing loss prevention program among schoolchildren working on their parents farms. The intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as was the control group (which received only minimal intervention). Reviewers' Conclusion(s): The limited evidence does not show whether tailored interventions are more or less effective than general interventions among workers, 80% of whom already use hearing protection. Long-lasting school-based interventions may increase the use of hearing protection substantially. Better interventions to enhance the use of hearing protection need to be developed and evaluated in order to increase the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss among workers.

AB  - Objective: To determine the frequency of hearing loss among textile industry workers of weaving department. To record the noise level in the weaving sections and to compare it with the international standards. To determine the awareness about the effects of noise on hearing amongst the workers and the protective measures adopted by them. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was carried out at weaving department of five renowned textile industries of Karachi. The study included 248 workers exposed to noise, through non-probability convenient sampling technique. Equivalent sound pressure level Leq was measured with the help of a Class-1 type digital sound level meter. Hearing status of the workers was assessed through questionnaire and clinical tests (WHISPER, RINNE'S and WEBER). Result(s): Results showed that noise level was in range of 88.4-104 dB(A). The questionnaire results showed that: (i) 92.7% of the workers were aware that high noise level cause speech interference. (ii) 57.2% were unaware about the effect of noise on health. (iii) 54.8% used ear protection devices. (iv) 22.5% did not respond well to whisper test while 16.9% were found to have defective hearing on the basis of Rinne's test and 17.4% through Weber's test. It was observed that hearing loss was significantly associated with working experience of more than 10 years (25%) and overtime (28.8%). Conclusion(s): The results of study establish the fact that noise level is more than acceptable limit of 85 dB(A) for 8 hours exposure stipulated by OSHA .There is an immediate need to develop and implement noise regulations in Pakistan.

AB  - An analytical design procedure to determine optimal noise hazard control strategies for industrial facilities is presented. Its objective is to determine a set of appropriate noise controls to eliminate or reduce noise levels so that workers' daily noise exposure does not exceed a permissible level. From a given noise control budget, engineering controls will be firstly implemented, followed by administrative controls, and then the use of hearing protection devices. Six optimization models are developed and sequentially applied to select appropriate noise controls without exceeding the budget. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed design procedure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Occupational and residential noise exposure has been related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Alteration of serum lipid levels has been proposed as a possible causal pathway. The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between ambient and at-the-ear occupational noise exposure and serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides when accounting for well-established predictors of lipid levels., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 424 industrial workers and 84 financial workers to obtain contrast in noise exposure levels. They provided a serum sample and wore portable dosimeters that every 5-s recorded ambient noise exposure levels during a 24-h period. We extracted measurements obtained during work and calculated the full-shift mean ambient noise level. For 331 workers who kept a diary on the use of a hearing protection device (HPD), we subtracted 10 dB from every noise recording obtained during HPD use and estimated the mean full-shift noise exposure level at the ear., RESULTS: Mean ambient noise level was 79.9 dB (A) [range 55.0-98.9] and the mean estimated level at the ear 77.8 dB (A) [range 55.0-94.2]. Ambient and at-the-ear noise levels were strongly associated with increasing levels of triglycerides, cholesterol-HDL ratio, and decreasing levels of HDL-cholesterol, but only in unadjusted analyses that did not account for HPD use and other risk factors., CONCLUSION: No associations between ambient or at-the-ear occupational noise exposure and serum lipid levels were observed. This indicates that a causal pathway between occupational and residential noise exposure and cardiovascular disease does not include alteration of lipid levels.

AB  - We investigated the effects of explosive acoustic trauma on sleep quality and quality of lives (QOLs) of the workers in Ammunition Factory. Forty-one male workers exposed to explosive acoustic trauma in Ammunition Factory 12 years ago constructed the study group (Group 1). Thirty-eight male workers of Ammunition Factory who were not exposed to the explosion, were included into the control group (Group 2). We used the Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) and SF-36 questionnaire. In workers of the study group who had experienced psychological and sleep problems; hearing loss and acute tinnitus just after explosion; and had higher education levels, some of the sleep and QOL parameters got worse. Workers, adjacent to the explosion site and not used earpluggs during explosion, had more impaired sleep quality results (p < 0.05). We may conclude that acute explosive acoustic trauma may affect negatively some items of sleep quality and quality of the lives of the workers. Workers should be educated to use ear muffs and ear plugs. For post-explosion sleep problems and other psychological problems, psychological support should be given to the workers by the health-team and their families. ©2009 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

AB  - It seems reasonable to assume that risk perception in workplaces can influence workers' behaviour and, consequently, their exposure to some occupational risks, such as the risk of noise exposure. However, only a small number of references in the literature stressed the relationship between risk perception and occupational noise exposure. The existing studies rarely include quantitative variables related to central factors such as noise exposure levels and workers' hearing status. This study was carried out with a sample of 516 industrial workers and aims at analysing the relationship between individual, contextual and perceptual-cognitive factors and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). The carried out data analysis revealed that individual risk perception and the outcome value for hearing preservation were the most significant predictors of the HPDs use. Workers' opinion about the company's safety climate also seems to play an important role as predictor. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In industrial environments, it is very likely to find several workers sharing the same workplaces and being exposed to the same noise pressure levels, who have different perceptions of the risks they are exposed to. These different perceptions could lead to different workers' attitudes and behaviours. The present study was carried out with a sample of 434 industrial workers exposed to noise pressure levels greater than the action level defined in Portuguese legislation (85 dB(A)). The study aims to analyse the role of individual risk recognitions in hearing protection devices' (HPD) utilisation rates. A questionnaire was developed to assess workers' risk perception of high-noise exposure and their utilisation of HPD. The multivariate data analysis of the several variables considered revealed that risk recognition in general and self-efficacy in particular, plays a significant role as a predictor of workers' behaviour with respect to the use of HPD. Furthermore, these results do suggest that risk recognition should be considered as an essential issue in the design and implementation of any Hearing Conservation Program, in particular in what concerns workers' training. Relevance to industry: Results obtained do suggest that workers' risk recognition could have an important impact on noise exposure protective behaviours and these could be used to design and conceive successful industrial Hearing Conservation Programs. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scientific literature on high-noise exposure effects is very extensive. Therefore, health and safety practitioners are aware of those effects and they know, very often, how to avoid it. However, workers exposed to high-noise levels often ignore the consequences of such exposure, or at least, their extension. Despite all advances in the study of occupational noise mitigation, the individual perception analysis and its implications on workers' behaviour, such as the use of Hearing Protection Devices (HPD), has been a minor research area. Some previous studies have concluded that individual perception, as well as contextual factors, are important predictors of safety behaviour, including the use of HPD. The present study comprises a sample of 434 industrial workers exposed to noise pressure levels greater than the action level defined in Portuguese legislation (85 dB(A)) and it aims at analysing the associations between some particular aspects of individual risk perception of noise exposure and the HPD use, as well as identifying the main factors influencing individual's risk perception. For this purpose, and considering the literature review, it was developed a questionnaire to assess workers risk perception of high-noise exposure and their HPD use profile. The multivariate data analysis of the several variables considered revealed that risk perception plays a significant role as a predictor of workers' behaviour, namely in what concerns the use of HPD. Furthermore, these results do suggest that risk perception should be considered as an essential issue in the design and implementation of any Hearing Conservation Program. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship among individual, contextual, and perceptual-cognitive factors and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). We studied 516 industrial workers exposed to noise levels greater than the Portuguese action level and developed a conceptual model for HPD use.

Workers' opinions about the company's safety climate and their perception of noise exposure effects also play important roles as predictors.

Furthermore, these results suggest that risk perception should be considered an essential issue in the design and implementation of any hearing conservation program, particularly in the development of training programs. Actual or potential applications of this research include the definition of more accurate strategies for promoting and motivating the use of HPDs.

AB  - Objectives: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) describes an acquired hearing deficiency directly attributable to excessive workplace noise exposure. Data suggest that excessive noise attributes to ~37% of all adult causes of hearing loss and remains a significant contributor to employment-related morbidity internationally. Typically insidiously-acquired, often without frank progressive symptomatology, regional medical agencies continue to struggle with this potentially debilitating condition. The aim of the study was to provide a synopsis of the current understanding of ONIHL, its impact on individual workers and the wider international community, and to identify barriers to more uniform adoption of personal hearing protection. Material(s) and Method(s): A review of the contemporary literature was performed using defined keyword searches and OVID, PubMed, and Google Scholar as primary electronic search engines. Result(s): A number of published works were identified, describing aspects of the relationship between workplace-related noise exposure and subsequent development of employee hearing impairment, which demonstrate an overwhelming gender imbalance, with up to 97% of affected individuals being male. Industry-specific associations (e.g., mining, manufacturing and heavy construction) were well documented, as were links to toxin-specific exposures, in the recognized development of hearing loss. However, evidence of integration of appraisal of the topically-current area of genetic susceptibility was often lacking. Much discordance still exists among international agencies in the prescriptive regulation and enforcement of "safe" exposure limits. Conclusion(s): Despite a high level of public awareness regarding the importance of hearing preservation and increasingly stringent international occupational health, safety and welfare requirements mandating provision of safer work environments, ONIHL continues to be a significant occupational hazard. ONIHL is permanent and may cause significant disability, for which there currently exists no cure, but is largely overtly-preventable. The impact of ONIHL on the global transition toward dominant communication-rich white-collar employment roles is difficult to quantitate, but is likely to be substantive upon the afflicted individual. In the mainstream setting, exposure-avoidance strategies aimed to reduce the incidence of ONIHL remain the focus of public health and occupational medicine approaches.

AB  - Background. Sleep deprivation has deleterious effects on most organ systems. Patients in the Intensive care unit (ICU) report sleep deprivation as the second worst experience during their stay only superseded by pain. The aim of the review is to provide the clinician with knowledge of the optimal sleep-friendly care and environment. Methods. Pubmed was systematically searched. Studies regarding polysomnography in ICU populations or healthy volunteers exposed to ICU conditions were included. Results. Thirty-eight studies were identified. The patients were qualitatively but not necessarily quantitatively sleep deprived with loss of circadian rhythm and extreme sleep fragmentation. Sedation, care interventions, noise, disease and mechanical ventilation are the most contributing factors to sleep deprivation. Conclusion. Sedation should be kept at a minimum and interrupted once daily. Care interventions should be clustered and noise reduced and/or masked with earplugs. NAVA, proportional assist+ or assist-control ventilation should be preferred to pressure support ventilation and adjusted to allow smaller tidal volumes, thus avoiding central apnoeas.

AB  - Background & Rationale: Loud noise can lead to adverse psychological effects including sleep disruption, anxiety, agitation and potentially acute confusional state. Such unfavorable responses are expected to disturb the recovery in hospitalized patients and increase the length of stay especially in acute care unit settings. Several noise control strategies such as creating white noise by music therapy and nature based sounds or noise reduction devices such as earplugs, earmuffs and cancelling devices have been suggested as measures to prevent the adverse neuro-behavioral outcomes. Objective(s): To investigate the potential benefits of noise control measures including white noise and noise reduction strategies in reducing anxiety, pain and sedation requirements and preventing delirium in ICU and other acute care units. Design(s): Systematic review ,meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and meta-regression. Setting(s): Acute care units (adult ICU, CCU, and observational units). Method(s): RCTs identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biomed Central, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PEDro and PubMed for inclusion through March 2015. The primary outcome was the anxiety level and the secondary outcomes were pain level, analgesic requirements, sedation level, sedative requirements and delirium free days. Results of individual RCTs were pooled using the random effect model. Standardized mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes for anxiety, sedation and pain and time to event analysis using hazard ratio for delirium free days. Result(s): Eighteen eligible RCTs involving 1411 participants (710 received noise control strategy and 701 received usual care) met our inclusion criteria. The noise control strategy was associated with significant reductions in the level of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.4; p<0.00001), pain (SMD, -0.43; 95%[CI], -0.67 to -0.19; p= 0.0004) sedation (SMD, -0.17; 95%[CI], -0.33 to -0.01; p= 0.004), and significantly lowered the incidence of delirium with a Hazard Ratio ((HR) of 0.5; 95%[CI], 0.27 to 0.82; p= 0.006). In the meta-regression model, there was a non-significant greater reduction of the anxiety level in patients who are <65 years and not ventilated compared to the overall patients ( ,p= 0.098). There were no significant effects for other moderator variables such length of treatment phase, serial interventions, and the type of acute care settings. Conclusion(s): In this analysis, the noise control strategies are effective in reducing neuro-behavioral outcomes in the acute care units. However, no conclusion can be made for long term effects of the noise control strategies.

AB  - Introduction: The concern of health professionals with hearing loss induced by noise began to extend to leisure activities, especially amongst adolescents. This fact is related to the overexposure to environments with harmful noise levels, and misuse of personal audio devices such as headphones. Objective(s): To evaluate the perception of adolescents about the environmental noise, their complaints, and hearing habits. Method(s): 26 adolescents of both genders, average age of 14.8 years old. Ninth grade age students in the Brazilian School System of a Municipal School in Joao Pessoa-PB. The Brazilian version of YANS questionnaire was utilized to explore attitudes of adolescents towards the noise, and issues related to hearing habits, analyzed by descriptive statistics. Result(s): Regarding the questionnaire YANS, 53.8% of the sample strongly disagrees to give up activities that the volume is too high, and 51.5% agree that it is unnecessary to use hearing protection when they are in these locations. The majority of the adolescents (84.6%) reported to have felt tinnitus, and 57.6% consider themselves sensitive to noise. However, 69.2% do not mind going to shows, even with previous experience of tinnitus. On hearing habits, 92.4% reported listening music with headphones daily, and 57.7% listen to music in high volumes at home. Conclusion(s): It was concluded that the harmful habits to hearing health are frequent amongst adolescents, which corroborates the early perception of tinnitus. Therefore, promoting hearing health through basic educational activities should be part of the school environment.

AB  - Background: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes. Objective(s): Primary objective To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. Secondary objectives 1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity). 2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age. 3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance. 4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care. Search Method(s): We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2ViewTM), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014. Selection Criteria: Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit. Data Collection and Analysis: We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main Result(s): One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age:

AB  - In noisy workrooms, exposure conditions such as noise level, exposure duration and use of hearing protection devices are contributory factors to hearing loss. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exposure conditions on the risk of hearing loss using the Cox model. Seventy workers, employed in a press workshop, were selected to study their hearing threshold using an audiometric test. Their noise exposure histories also were analyzed. The results of the Cox model showed that the job type, smoking and the use of protection devices were effective to induce hearing loss. The relative risk of hearing loss in smokers was 1.1 times of non-smokers The relative risk of hearing loss in workers with the intermittent use of protection devices was 3.3 times those who used these devices continuously. The Cox model could analyze the effect of exposure conditions on hearing loss and provides useful information for managers in order to improve hearing conservation programs.

AB  - Background: Postoperative management of patients undergoing esophagectomy is particularly challenging because of the risk of severe postoperative complications. The permanence in ICU, the use of vasopressors, painful stimuli, a nasogastric tube kept in place for the first postoperative days cause constant discomfort that can affect sleep and the use of hypnotics is neither completely successful nor lacking in possible consequences. This can influence postoperative patients' management, their quality of sleep and the consequent perception of quality of life. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of two measures potentially improving quality of postoperative sleep and quality of perceived care, playing a part in global quality of life. Method(s): Measures arranged were: psychological counselling and isolation devices (ear plugs and eye sleeping mask). Seventy-five patients were randomized into four groups receiving respectively: psychological counselling plus devices; psychological counselling alone; devices; standard care. Quality of life and quality of sleep were measured preoperatively and at hospital discharge with EORTC QLQ-C30 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), moreover patients' satisfaction was evaluatedwith IN-PATSAT32. Result(s): Demographic and clinical characteristics were homogeneous in the four randomized groups. Psychological counseling significantly reduced the impairment of C30-QL (p50.02). Overall, 50% patients referred sleep disorder (C30-SL) after surgery, with similar rates in the 4 groups (p50.92). However, psychological support with isolation devices reduced the proportion of patients reporting postoperative impairment of global sleep quality (p50.004) and of sleep duration (p50.002) measured by PSQI. At discharge, satisfaction about doctors' interpersonal skills and technical skills was lower in the standard care group (p50.007 and p50.02, respectively). Satisfaction about nurses' availability and technical skills was higher in the group with isolation measures (p50.02 and p50.04, respectively). Discussion(s): Psychological support with isolation devices improve postoperative management of sleep disturbances reducing the proportion of patients reporting postoperative impairment of global sleep quality and of sleep duration. Perioperative psychological support improves global quality of life, even after adjusting for postoperative morbidity. Considering patients' perceived quality of care at discharge, groupswith measures give a better evaluation: this reflects an improvement in health worker-patient relation due to the specific patient management.

AB  - To examine how individual surfing behaviour affects the development of external auditory canal exostosis and to produce a model to predict exostosis severity. A standardised questionnaire was completed and each participant underwent an otoscopic examination. Surfers were recruited from August to October 2011 from surfing competitions and from colleges in the South West of England. 207 surfers were included, 53 % had evidence of external auditory canal; exostosis: grade 1, 23 %; grade 2, 16 %, grade 3, 16 %. This risk of exostosis significantly increased with (1) surfing for 6 or more years, (2) surfing in the winter months, (3) surfing five or more times per month in the winter and (4) reported ear symptoms. Interestingly, participation in other water sports and wearing earplugs or a hood reduced the risk of developing exostosis. Surfers who surf in England are at significant risk of exostosis. A probability model was designed, incorporating different surfing behaviours and ear symptoms, the first of its kind in exostosis research. This model will be a useful tool for raising awareness of external ear canal exostosis in the surfing community and in assessing individual need for surgical intervention.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: The national standard survey, Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), measures the patient's perspective on hospital care. One area that continually evokes sub-optimal results is the 'quiet at night' measurement. Our investigation explored the patient's perception of nighttime "noise" in the hospital setting. Method(s): Patients in our medical surgical/telemetry floors subjectively evaluated the noise level at night. An ethnographic interview method was utilized that was approved and standardized to prevent bias. Results were stratified and coded. Result(s): A total of 224 patients completed the process prior to any intervention to provide our hospital with a baseline understanding of the current state. We then utilized two evidenced-based approaches which have been shown to decrease a patient's perception of noise: a sleep pack consisting of ear plugs, headphones, and a sleep mask, and one-on-one education on how to use the relaxation channel. Of the additional 101 patients who received this education, twenty-seven of these participants completed a second interview the following day, which allowed for comparison data to be compiled. By speaking with the patients, our investigation not only yielded information regarding the perception of noise level in their room, but additionally identified factors that were the cause of the noise. Although, our two interventions did not produce a positive change in noise level, it did provide valuable feedback and insight for quality initiatives. Conclusion(s): Noise level is a quality issue which needs to be continually addressed. Our interdisciplinary team, along with nursing leadership, intends to move forward with developing a plan to promote an optimal healing environment.

AB  - A human factors experiment employed a hemi-anechoic sound field in which listeners were required to localize a vehicular backup alarm warning signal (both a standard and a frequency-augmented alarm) in 360-degrees azimuth in pink noise of 60 dBA and 90 dBA. Measures of localization performance included: (1) percentage correct localization, (2) percentage of right--left localization errors, (3) percentage of front-rear localization errors, and (4) localization absolute deviation in degrees from the alarm's actual location. In summary, the data demonstrated that, with some exceptions, normal hearing listeners' ability to localize the backup alarm in 360-degrees azimuth did not improve when wearing augmented hearing protectors (including dichotic sound transmission earmuffs, flat attenuation earplugs, and level-dependent earplugs) as compared to when wearing conventional passive earmuffs or earplugs of the foam or flanged types. Exceptions were that in the 90 dBA pink noise, the flat attenuation earplug yielded significantly better accuracy than the polyurethane foam earplug and both the dichotic and the custom-made diotic electronic sound transmission earmuffs. However, the flat attenuation earplug showed no benefit over the standard pre-molded earplug, the arc earplug, and the passive earmuff. Confusions of front-rear alarm directions were most significant in the 90 dBA noise condition, wherein two types of triple-flanged earplugs exhibited significantly fewer front-rear confusions than either of the electronic muffs. On all measures, the diotic sound transmission earmuff resulted in the poorest localization of any of the protectors due to the fact that its single-microphone design did not enable interaural cues to be heard. Localization was consistently more degraded in the 90 dBA pink noise as compared with the relatively quiet condition of the 60 dBA pink noise. A frequency-augmented backup alarm, which incorporated 400 Hz and 4000 Hz components to exploit the benefits of interaural phase and intensity cues respectively, slightly but significantly improved localization compared with the standard, more narrow-bandwidth backup alarm, and these results have implications for the updating of backup alarm standards.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the correlates and barriers to helmet use among motorcycle riders in Wa, a motorcycle-predominant town in Ghana. An additional objective was to determine the association between helmet use and riders' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward helmets., METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys including both observation of helmet use and interviews were conducted among motorcycle riders at 6 randomly selected fuel stations and 4 motorcycle service centers within and outside the Central Business District of Wa. Questions covered riders' sociodemographic and riding characteristics, helmet use, reasons for use or nonuse of helmets, and knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about helmets. Analyses were based on frequencies and testing of strength of association using adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) in binary logistic regression., RESULTS: The prevalence of helmet use among the 271 sampled riders was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.2-52.0). Gender, age, marital status, and occupation were significant sociodemographic correlates of helmet use in Wa. Compared to currently married riders, unmarried riders were 5 times less likely to use a helmet. No significant association existed between riders' educational attainment and helmet use. Helmet use was also positively correlated with helmet ownership and license holding. The leading reasons stated for helmet nonuse among nonusers were not traveling a long distance and helmets block vision and hearing. Protection from injury, legal requirement, and coping with the police for fear of being accosted for helmet nonuse were identified as common reasons for helmet use. Positive attitudes and beliefs were also significantly correlated with helmet use., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of a legislation mandating the use of helmets on all roads as well as the high level of awareness among riders on this legislation and the benefits of helmets, the incidence of helmet use among motorists continue to be low in Wa, Ghana. This means that efforts to identify strategies to increase helmet use need to continue. The evidence provided by this study suggests that stakeholders in road safety need to put in interventions to ensure a rigorous enforcement of the helmet use legislation and improvement in helmet design. These should be combined with the development of targeted educational programs with the aim of changing unfavorable attitudes and beliefs toward helmet use.

AB  - This cross-sectional study investigated noise annoyance, awareness and practice among the workers in two steel factories in UAE. The study involving 468 steel workers randomly selected. Noise exposure was estimated using the integrated sound level meter. A structured interview questionnaire was used to assess the noise annoyance, awareness and practice of workers towards the noise. The results showed that about 89% of the workers exposed to a daily Leq above the permissible level which is 85 dB (A) and 45% of them had never used any hearing protection devices. About 58% of the workers experienced a moderate or high degree of noise annoyance. Only 4.1% and 1.9% of the workers aware about the health effects of noise and the methods of prevention respectively and awareness was positively associated with noise exposure. Few workers (13.2%) used the hearing protection devices during the working time. Thus workers within both factories are at high risk of developing noise annoyance, and other related ailments due to excessive occupational expo-sure to noise, and non-use of hearing protection devices. There was an association between noise annoyance and noise level and any one of them could influence the workers to use the hearing protection devices. There is a need to have a hearing conservation program in both factories one of its main components is education to raise the awareness of workers about noise hazards and methods of prevention. Finally, the factor noise annoyance should be incorporated into all future studies on the use of hearing protection devices.Copyright © Hafiz Omer Ahmed.

Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of using earmuffs on the seven most common vital signs in newborns in NICUs. Method(s): This is a prospective controlled study. All term and pre-term infants admitted to the NICU were randomized to either an "earmuffs" or a "no earmuffs" area and underwent hourly measurements and recording of vital signs during routine NICU activity for three consecutive days. Data were collected by sampling data from the routine continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (OSAT), blood pressure (BP), FIO2 requirement, pain score (PS), and temperature (T). Exclusion criteria included neonates on high frequency ventilation, sedation and congenital anomalies with possible auditory system involvement. Result(s): The study included 182 infants; of them 100 infants completed the 72-hour measurements. Vital signs of fifty newborn infants in each group were recorded for a period of 72 hours. During this time, the observed linear increase in heart rate was significantly reduced within the earmuffs group (139 versus 146 beat per minute) with p value <0.001, which also exhibited a similar significant decrease in systolic BP, although there was no evidence of significant difference between-group effect for diastolic BP and mean blood pressure. The average RR in the EM group was significantly lower than the NEM group for the entire 72-hour period (0.001), while temperature showed no significant difference between the two groups across the same time-period. Earmuffs also conferred a small but significant improvement in the gradual increase of the average O2 saturation (p value = 0.01). Similar improvement due to earmuffs could also be seen in the infants' requirement for oxygen (days); the average oxygen requirement was 1.8 days versus 2.5 days with p value of <0.001. Conclusion(s): Wearing earmuffs inside the NICU had a positive effect on the infants' vital signs. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of hearing protective earmuffs which incorporate active noise reduction (ANR) on sound source identification was studied. The purpose was determine whether ANR interfered with the encoding of cues normally used for directional hearing. Right/left, front/back and within quadrant confusions were assessed in quiet using a circular array of eight loudspeakers. Three stimuli, one-third octave bands centred at 0.5 kHz and 4 kHz and broadband noise, were presented. These enabled an assessment of the utilization of mainly interaural time-of-arrival and level differences, and binaural and spectral cues in combination, respectively. Two groups of normal hearing subjects aged 18-30 and 40-55 years, half male and half female, participated. Overall, age, gender, and ANR were not significant determinants of outcome. The probably of correctly discriminating among the eight speakers decreased significantly with the muffs worn, relative to unoccluded listening by 10%, 35% and 40% for the 0.5 kHz, 4 kHz and broadband stimuli, respectively. The pattern of errors indicated that the earmuffs interfered with the encoding of both binaural (interaural level differences) and spectral cues. With ANR small additional right/left confusions were observed for the low-frequency stimulus (time-of-arrival cue) for speakers close to the midline axis. The results provide further evidence that earmuffs should not be used in situations where the perception of the direction of hazard is a concern. ANR technology does not appear to increase the handicap.

AB  - Integrated hearing protection systems are designed to enhance free field and radio communications during military operations while protecting against the damaging effects of high-level noise exposure. A study was conducted to compare the effect of increasing the radio volume on the intelligibility of speech over the radios of two candidate systems, in-ear and muff-style, in 85-dBA speech babble noise presented free field. Twenty normal-hearing, English-fluent subjects, half male and half female, were tested in same gender pairs. Alternating as talker and listener, their task was to discriminate consonant-vowel-consonant syllables that contrasted either the initial or final consonant. Percent correct consonant discrimination increased with increases in the radio volume. At the highest volume, subjects achieved 79% with the in-ear device but only 69% with the muff-style device, averaged across the gender of listener/talker pairs and consonant position. Although there was no main effect of gender, female listener/talkers showed a 10% advantage for the final consonant and male listener/talkers showed a 1% advantage for the initial consonant. These results indicate that normal hearing users can achieve reasonably high radio communication scores with integrated in-ear hearing protection in moderately high-level noise that provides both energetic and informational masking. The adequacy of the range of available radio volumes for users with hearing loss has yet to be determined.

AB  - Conventional hearing protection devices result in decrements mainly in the ability to distinguish front from rearward sound sources. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of wearing an earplug with advanced communications capability, in combination with an army helmet, on horizontal plane speaker identification. Ten normal-hearing male subjects were tested in a semi-reverberant sound proof booth under eight conditions defined by combinations of two levels of ear occlusion (unoccluded and occluded by the earplug) and four levels of the helmet (head bare and fitted with the helmet modified to give no, partial and full ear coverage). Percent correct speaker identification was assessed using a horizontal array of eight loudspeakers surrounding the subject at one meter. These were positioned close to the midline and interaural axes of the head, at ear level. The stimulus was a 75-dB SPL, 300-ms broadband white noise. Both degree of ear coverage and ear occlusion significantly determined outcome. Overall percent correct ranged from 93.6% (bareheaded) to 79.7% (full ear coverage) with the ears unoccluded, and from 83.4%-77.5% with ear occlusion. Both variables affected the prevalence of mirror image confusions for positions 30 apart in front and back of the interaural axis. With ear occlusion, front given back errors were more likely than back given front errors, increasing with degree of ear coverage to 49% and 25.4%, respectively. These errors also increased with ear coverage with the ears unoccluded, but were similar. Both degree of ear coverage and ear occlusion significantly impacted horizontal plane speaker identification, particularly for sources close to the interaural axis. However, overall percent correct was higher than observed in a previous study with conventional and level-dependent hearing protection devices, using the same array.

AB  - Introduction: Continuous increase in the cost of claims for noise-induced hearing loss in Canadian Forces personnel prompted a review of hearing conservation practices. Investigations comprised retrospective analyses of hearing test results and a prospective survey of risk factors for hearing loss. Method(s): There were 1057 individuals working in 107 air, land, and sea trades who contributed their current and first hearing test results. Subjects completed a 64-item questionnaire relating to demographics, occupational and non-occupational noise exposure history, training in and use of hearing protection, and non-noise risk factors, including head injury, ear disease, medications, and solvent exposure. Subject recruitment, hearing assessment, and questionnaire distribution were carried out by military personnel. Apparatus and protocols for hearing testing conformed to current clinical practice. Result(s): Prevalence of moderate to severe hearing loss progressed with age, with hearing thresholds in those over 45 yr ranging broadly from normal to over 70 dB HL. Unprotected exposure to noise and solvents appeared to be the likely determinates of adverse outcome. Head injury, ear disease, and the use of ototoxic medications had minimal impact. The data for individuals in 17 selected trades in the 3 environments modeled that of the total sample. Discussion(s): Responses to the questionnaire suggested that training on noise hazard and selection and use of hearing protection were inadequate. Hearing protection was reported to be incompatible with other gear, uncomfortable, and an impediment to communication. Approaches for upgrading hearing conservation strategies, including the creation of end-user focus groups, were considered. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between hearing levels, otoacoustic emission levels and listening habits related to the use of personal listening devices (PLDs) in adults with varying health-related fitness. Duration of PLD use was estimated and volume level was directly measured. Biomarkers of health-related fitness were co-factored into the analyses. 115 subjects ages 18-84 participated in this study. Subjects were divided into two sub-groups; PLD users and non-PLD users. Both groups completed audiological and health-related fitness tests. Due to the mismatch in the mean age of the PLD user versus the non-PLD user groups, age-adjusted statistics were performed to determine factors that contributed to hearing levels. Age was the most significant predictor of hearing levels across listening and health-related fitness variables. PLD user status did not impact hearing measures, yet PLD users who listened less than 8 hours per week with intensities of less than 80 dBA were found to have better hearing. Other variables found to be associated with hearing levels included: years listening to PLD, number of noise environments and use of ear protection. Finally, a healthy waist-to-hip ratio was asignificant predictor of better hearing, while body mass index approached, but did not reach statistical significance. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective: In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed an impulse noise reduction rating (NRR) for hearing protection devices based upon the impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) methods in the ANSI S12.42-2010 standard. This study tests the ANSI S12.42 methods with a range of hearing protection devices measured in field conditions. Design(s): The method utilizes an acoustic test fixture and three ranges for impulse levels: 130134, 148152, and 166170 dB peak SPL. For this study, four different models of hearing protectors were tested: Bilsom 707 Impact II electronic earmuff, E.A.R Pod Express, E.A.R Combat Arms version 4, and the Etymotic Research, Inc. Electronic BlastPLGTM EB1. Study sample: Five samples of each protector were fitted on the fixture or inserted in the fixture's ear canal five times for each impulse level. Impulses were generated by a 0.223 caliber rifle. Result(s): The average IPILs increased with peak pressure and ranged between 20 and 38 dB. For some protectors, significant differences were observed across protector examples of the same model, and across insertions. Conclusion(s): The EPA's proposed methods provide consistent and reproducible results. The proposed impulse NRR rating should utilize the minimum and maximum protection percentiles as determined by the ANSI S12.42-2010 methods. © 2012 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - Objective: Identification of the beliefs and attitudes towards noise exposure and the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Brazilian children. Design(s): Prospective cross-sectional study through interviews with children and their parents. Study sample: 753 children were selected and invited to participate. The final sample was 475 children and 404 parents. Result(s): In general, children disliked noisy places (67%). Although 87.4% of the children and 93.9% of the parents considered loud sounds damaging to the ears, children were poorly informed about hearing protection and did not have hearing protection devices. Children were mostly exposed to parties and concerts with loud music (51.9%), carnaval (Mardi Gras) parties (38.2%), firecrackers (36.8%), and loud music at home or in the car (33.1%), or from listening to loud music with earphones (17.3%). Compared to children from private schools, children from public schools had a greater preference for loud sounds and were less informed about hearing protection. Conclusion(s): Knowledge of hearing risk from loud sounds was not enough to prompt preventive behaviors, and adults exposed children to loud sounds. © 2012 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.

AB  - This study aims to identify the noise exposure and verify if the hearing protection used by these workers is adjusted for the exposure to the impact noise during the activities of Basic Shot Instruction in the Brazilian Army produced by Light Automatic Fusils - FAL, caliber 7.62mm. This study can be considered analytical, since it seeks to establish causal relations among the diverse variables involved. It was used the qualitative approach, in the mapping of the working process; and also the quantitative approach in order to analyze the data in relation to this process. It was possible to have a close estimate of the reality on the basis of data collection triangulation, to include: systematic observation, half structured interview and experimental exercise. Based on the analyses, it can be stated these workers are exposed to a noise which ranges from 147.3 to 171 dB. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 3M 1100 hearing protection, which is largely used by military, do not provide noise reduction, since its reducing value corresponds to NRRsf at 12 dB. Thus, there is no effectiveness in hearing protection for the soldiers.

AB  - Noise exposure is probably the most ubiquitous of all occupational hazards, and there is evidence for causal links between noise and both auditory and nonauditory health effects. Noise control at source is rarely considered, resulting in reliance on hearing protection devices to reduce exposure. A comprehensive noise survey of four lumber mills using a randomized sampling strategy was undertaken, resulting in 350 full-shift personal dosimetry measurements. Sound frequency spectrum data and information on hearing protector usage was collected. A determinants-of-exposure regression model for noise was developed. Mean (L(eq,8hr)) exposure level was 91.7 dBA, well above the exposure British Columbia (BC) limit of 85 dBA. Of 52 jobs for which more than a single observation was made, only 4 were below the exposure limit. Twenty-eight jobs had means over 90 dBA, and four jobs had means over 100 dBA. The sawmill and by-products departments of the lumber mills had the highest exposure to low frequency noise, while the planing and saw filing areas had the highest exposure to high frequency noise. Hearing protector use was greatest among those exposed above 95 dBA, and among those exposed between 85 and 95 dBA, self-reported use was 84% for 73% of the time. The determinants of exposure model had an R(2) of 0.52, and the within-participant correlation was 0.07. Key predictors in the final model were mill; enclosure and enclosure construction material; and certain departments, jobs, and noise sources. The study showed that workers in lumber mills are highly exposed to noise, and although the prevalence of the use of hearing protection is high, their use is unlikely to provide complete protection again noise-induced hearing loss at the observed exposures. Determinants of noise exposure modeling offers a good method for the quantitative estimation of noise exposure.

AB  - Children of individuals with bipolar disorder (bipolar offspring) are at increased risk for developing mood disorders, but strategies to predict mood episodes are unavailable. In this study, we used support vector machine (SVM) to characterize the potential of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in predicting the first mood episode in youth bipolar offspring. From a longitudinal neuroimaging study, 19 at-risk youth who developed their first mood episode (converters), and 19 without mood episodes during follow-up (non-converters) were selected and matched for age, sex and follow-up time. Baseline 1H-MRS data were obtained from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Glutamate (Glu), myo-inositol (mI), choline (Cho), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and phosphocreatine plus creatine (PCr + Cr) levels were calculated. SVM with a linear kernel was adopted to classify converters and non-converters based on their baseline metabolites. SVM allowed the significant classification of converters and non-converters across all regions for Cho (accuracy = 76.0%), but not for other metabolites. Considering all metabolites within each region, SVM allowed the significant classification of converters and non-converters for left VLPFC (accuracy = 76.5%), but not for right VLPFC or ACC. The combined mI, PCr + Cr, and Cho from left VLPFC achieved the highest accuracy differentiating converters from non-converters (79.0%). Our findings from this exploratory study suggested that 1H-MRS levels of mI, Cho, and PCr + Cr from left VLPFC might be useful to predict the development of first mood episode in youth bipolar offspring using machine learning. Future studies that prospectively examine and validate these metabolites as predictors of mood episodes in high-risk individuals are necessary.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As a stressor widely existing in daily life, noise can cause great alterations to the immune system and result in many physical and mental disorders, including noise-induced deafness, sleep disorders, cardiovascular diseases, endocrine diseases and other problems. The immune system plays a major role in maintaining homeostasis by recognizing and removing harmful substances in the body. Many studies have shown that noise may play vital roles in the occurrence and development of some immune diseases. In humans, both innate immunity and specific immunity can be influenced by noise, and different exposure durations and intensities of noise may exert various effects on the immune system. Short-term or low-intensity noise can enhance immune function, while long-term or high-intensity noise suppresses it. Noise can lead to the occurrence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) through the production of autoantibodies such as anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp60 and exert adverse effects related to other immune-related diseases such as some autoimmune diseases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The neuroendocrine system, mainly including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) system, is involved in the mechanisms of immune-related diseases induced by noise and gut microbiota dysfunction. In addition, noise exposure during pregnancy may be harmful to the immune system of the fetus. On the other hand, some studies have shown that music can improve immune function and alleviate the adverse effects caused by noise.© Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Zou, Guo, Wang, Shen, Hu, Ye and Xiang.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the risk of occupational hearing loss caused by noise exposure in an automobile parts manufacturing enterprise. Method(s): In June 2019, an automobile parts manufacturing enterprise in Huizhou City was selected to conduct occupational hygiene field investigation, and occupational health investigation and occupational hazards detection were carried out in the workplace. 395 workers with 8-hour working day equivalent sound level (L(ex.8 h)) >=85 dB (a) were selected as the research objects. The occupational noise exposure risk assessment method was used to assess the noise exposure risk of L(ex.8 h)>=85 dB (a) , and the risk of high-frequency hearing loss and occupational noise deafness caused by noise exposure were evaluated when the working years were 10, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Result(s): When the exposure years were less than or equal to 30 years, the risk of high-frequency hearing loss of bearing pedestal final examiners was medium risk, and the risk of other positions was acceptable; the highest risk of noise deafness was the bearing pedestal final examiner, and the risk classification was higher, and the other types of work were negligible risk and acceptable risk. When the exposure years are more than 30 years, the risk classification of high-frequency hearing loss of bearing pedestal final inspection workers is high-risk, and the risk classification of other types of work is medium risk; the highest risk of noise deafness is the bearing pedestal final inspection workers, and the risk classification is higher risk, and the other types of work are medium risk. Conclusion(s): The enterprise should pay attention to the risk of occupational hearing loss caused by noise exposure, especially the bearing pedestal final inspection workers, and strengthen the hearing protection of noise exposed people.

AB  - Context: There are several ways to assess the noise reducing efficiency of earmuffs, but they usually involve using human participants and/or specialized equipment. Objective(s): The current study was designed to develop a less labor-intensive, cost-effective, participant-free first-pass method for measuring the efficiency of earmuffs. Method(s): We evaluated the noise-cancelling ability of five different types of earmuffs (3M: Optime 98, Optime 105; iDEA USA V201; Tronsmart Encore S6; Bose QuietComfort 35) under laboratory and field conditions. We compared our results to the microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) method. Lastly, a survey of college-aged students was also conducted to determine which earmuffs were the most comfortable and provided the best fit. Result(s): Of the five earmuffs studied, the Optime 98 and Bose earmuffs were most effective at reducing noise levels in both the laboratory and field. These earmuffs also received the highest scores for comfort, fit, and perceived ability to reduce noise, with Bose being slightly more preferred than Optime 98. The MIRE method provided the same overall results as the laboratory and field tests. Conclusion(s): Our method for evaluating the noise-canceling ability of earmuffs could be used to supplement more complicated testing procedures as a first-pass method.

AB  - Background Environmental factors such as exposure to noise may act as a trigger for atrial fibrillation (AF). This case illustrates exposure to environmental noise as a trigger of AF. Case A 59-year-old man with past medical history significant for hyperlipidemia presented to the office with palpitations. He reported palpitations over the last year but noted an increase in frequency to approximately once weekly with episodes lasting for a few hours. An electrocardiogram showed AF with rapid ventricular response. The episodes most frequently occurred during or after exposure to loud industrial engines at work despite wearing ear protection and was associated with fatigue. He denied concurrent chest pain, syncope, presyncope, shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Decision-making He was previously prescribed metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice daily as needed by his primary care physician and the dose and frequency were increased to 50mg twice daily. Thyroid stimulating hormone was within normal limits and an echocardiogram showed no significant abnormalities. A treadmill nuclear stress test was within normal limits. A two-week Holter monitor noted paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, particularly when around loud industrial engines at work with noise in the range of 106-136 decibels (dB). He was prescribed flecainide 300 mg to use as needed. The patient had a CHADS2-VASc score of 0 and deferred anticoagulation after discussion of the associated risks versus benefits. A sleep study is scheduled as the patient admitted to apneic events and snoring at night. He also requested to avoid areas at work with large amounts of noise. Conclusion Exposure to sounds greater than 20 dB is noted to increase the risk of AF. (1) By increasing awareness of this modifiable risk factor for AF in otherwise healthy patients, unnecessary medications, testing and healthcare costs can be avoided. Reference: 1.

AB  - Introduction: Temporary hearing threshold shift might develop after noise exposure due to magnetic resonance imaging. We aimed to investigate the effects of acoustic noise during 1.5 Tesla temporal bone MRI on audiometric tests and disturbance self-reports in patients with tinnitus. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-three symptomatic ears of 55 patients with persistent tinnitus were included in this study. Sound level recordings of imaging room were made with dosimeter. Two age groups (<65 years and > 65 years) were created. Hearing thresholds were measured before, 24 hours after and 1 month after performing magnetic resonance imaging. Visual analogue scale, tinnitus handicap inventory and the Beck depression inventory were applied to all patients before and 24 hours after the imaging. Result(s): The mean intensity of acoustic noise during imaging was recorded as 99.3+/-3.4 dBA (109.9+/-4.1 dB). The threshold shifts were statistically higher in patients aged >=65 than the ones aged <65 for 2000 and 4000 frequencies (p<0.05). The mean temporary shifts in tinnitus loudness were 5.00+/-6.495 dB and 10.17+/-11.179 dB for the patients with age<65 and age>=65 respectively (p = 0.018). While majority of the time dependent effects were significant for audiometric tests; they were insignificant for self-reported questionnaires, except visual analogue scale 5, which was higher in patients aged<65 (p = 0.012). Conclusion(s): Acoustic noise due to 1.5 Tesla temporal bone magnetic resonance imaging caused hearing threshold shifts and deterioration in intensity and disturbance of the tinnitus especially in elderly. Hearing protection is essentially required for all patients, when it is indicated.Copyright © 2020, Geriatrics Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the hearing self-protection behavior patterns and internal factors of workers exposured to occupational noise in an aircraft manufacturing industry based on health belief model, so as to provide reference for further health promotion programs and intervention measures. Method(s): A total of 1600 front-line workers were selected from 10 units of an aircraft manufacturing enterprise by cluster sampling method. The basic and occupational information of employees were collected, and a self-reported questionnaire was designed according to the health belief model to acquire the hearing self-protection behaviors of workers. Result(s): There were significant differences in the perceived severity, perceived benefit, perceived impairment, self-efficacy and behavioral incentive scores of different hearing self-protection behaviors among the noise-causing workers (P<0.05). There were significant differences in the distribution of hearing self-protection behaviors among different genders, ages, education levels, length of service, initial noise exposure time and cumulative noise reception time (P<0.05). The perceived benefits, perceived barriers, behavioral incentives, self-efficacy scores, and educational attainment of the noise-causing workers were all related to the type of hearing self-protection behavior (P<0.05) . Conclusion(s): The educational level and health belief model can predict the hearing self-protection behavior patterns of front-line workers to some extent, more attention should be paid to the monitoring of the well-educated employees.

AB  - One enduring challenge for controlling high frequency sound in local active noise control (ANC) systems is to obtain the acoustic signal at the specific location to be controlled. In some applications such as in ANC headrest systems, it is not practical to install error microphones in a person's ears to provide the user a quiet or optimally acoustically controlled environment. Many virtual error sensing approaches have been proposed to estimate the acoustic signal remotely with the current state-of-the-art method using an array of four microphones and a head tracking system to yield sound reduction up to 1 kHz for a single sound source. In the work reported in this paper, a novel approach of incorporating remote acoustic sensing using a laser Doppler vibrometer into an ANC headrest system is investigated. In this "virtual ANC headphone" system, a lightweight retro-reflective membrane pick-up is mounted in each synthetic ear of a head and torso simulator to determine the sound in the ear in real-time with minimal invasiveness. The membrane design and the effects of its location on the system performance are explored, the noise spectra in the ears without and with ANC for a variety of relevant primary sound fields are reported, and the performance of the system during head movements is demonstrated. The test results show that at least 10 dB sound attenuation can be realised in the ears over an extended frequency range (from 500 Hz to 6 kHz) under a complex sound field and for several common types of synthesised environmental noise, even in the presence of head motion.

AB  - Objective(s): The Osia System (CochlearTM) is an active osseointegrated system intended for the treatment of patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss. It can be also used in cases of single-sided deafness (SSD) for contralateral routing of signal (CROS) for bone conduction thresholds <= 25 dB HL on the contralateral side. The Osia implant is placed subcutaneously under the intact skin behind the ear with the piezoelectric actuator attached to an osseointegrated BI300 implant on the mastoid. The external processor is magnetically attached to the head. As the Osia was recently CE certified, and new on the market, with limited patient outcome data for SSD available, the objective of this study was the evaluation of audiological results and patient satisfaction for the Osia system in SSD patients. Method(s): Six patients (age 53.2 +/- 5.2) with long-term SSD since birth or early childhood (five cases) or short-term SSD with insufficient treatment with a cochlear implant (one case) were implanted with an Osia in clinical routine to benefit from CROS hearing. A retrospective, monocentric clinical observation study was performed. Audiological measurements included hearing thresholds, sound field audiograms (S0) with the contralateral ear muffled and plugged and word recognition score (in %) in quiet using the Freiburg monosyllable test. Speech intelligibility was determined with the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA) in quiet (S90Osia; in %) and in noise (S0N90contra and S90OsiaN90contra; in dB SNR) with an adaptive speech level. All tests were performed unaided and aided with the Osia System. Subjective benefit with the Osia system for SSD patients was determined by using two questionnaires; the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Bern Benefit in Single Sided Deafness (BBSSD). Result(s): Two months after activation, audiological results with the Osia system showed an improvement in speech perception in quiet and in as noisy environments. Patient confirmed a significant benefit with the Osia system compared to the unaided situation by reporting of less problems and easier conversations in everyday listening situations. Conclusion(s): The Osia system is a good alternative for Patients with SSD who cannot benefit from cochlear implants.

AB  - Symphony orchestra musicians are exposed to noise levels that put them at risk of developing hearing damage. This study evaluates the potential effectivity of common control measures used in orchestras on open stages with a typical symphonic setup. A validated acoustic prediction model is used that calculates binaural sound exposure levels at the ears of all musicians in the orchestra. The model calculates the equivalent sound levels for a performance of the first 2min of the 4th movement of Mahler's 1st symphony, which can be considered representative for loud orchestral music. Calculated results indicate that risers, available space, and screens at typical positions do not significantly influence sound exposure. A hypothetical scenario with surround screens shows that, even when shielding all direct sound from others, sound exposure is reduced moderately with the largest effect on players in loud sections. In contrast, a dramatic change in room acoustic conditions only leads to considerable reductions for soft players. It can be concluded that significant reductions are only reached with extreme measures that are unrealistic. It seems impossible for the studied physical measures to be effective enough to replace hearing protection devices such as ear plugs.

AB  - Objective: Sound levels in nightclubs are dangerously high. We administered the Dangerous Decibels hearing-health intervention to nightclub staff to test its efficacy. Design(s): In a single group, repeated measures were taken before training, a week after training and at 3 months after training. Setting(s): A nightclub in the city of Auckland, New Zealand. Method(s): We delivered training to 20 people who work in nightclubs: bar staff, disc jockeys (DJs), security staff and police. We assessed supports and barriers towards hearing-health behaviour, knowledge, attitudes and self-reported behaviour at the three time points. Result(s): The ratio of supports to barriers for good hearing-health behaviour improved 1 week after training and continued to improve at 3 months. Participants' knowledge increased after training and was maintained 3 months later. Attitudes and self-reported behaviour did not change. Conclusion(s): The continued improvement in supports-to-barriers ratio at 3 months post-training has not been observed previously and may reflect a change in participants' thinking as a result of the intervention. The lack of change in self-reported behaviour implies that the effect of acculturation to loud music in nightclubs was not wholly overcome.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive approach for understanding brain-behavior relationships in humans and will play an important role in unraveling how gene by environment interactions shape the neurobiology underlying behavioral as well as physical phenotypes of interest. One critical avenue of research is understanding the role these factors play in shaping neural circuits during early infancy (0-1 year of age), as this critical period of development can influence more apparent neurobehavioral and physical phenotypes across life. A major obstacle to this research is that relative to adolescents and adults, the MRI methods for infant scan preprocessing for subsequent analysis, particularly in regard to brain tissue segmentation, are extremely underdeveloped. As opposed to MRI scans from adults for which various automated pipelines are effective (e.g., FAST, SPM), in infants the segmentation step is by far the most difficult to implement owing to several factors that create difficulty in discerning voxel intensity values corresponding to different tissue types such as gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as cortical and subcortical structures. This leads to 'partial volume' effects, or ambiguity regarding the tissue identity of specific voxels particularly along boundaries of tissue types and structures, causing ineffective segmentation across the majority of methods attempted to date. Compared with adults, infant brains 1) have a much lower contrast-to-noise ratio due to the relative lack of myelination and shorter scan times; 2) lower resolution due to the smaller overall volume of the brain; 3) reversal of GM/WM voxel intensity values before 6 months of age due to the transiently lower intensity of unmyelinated WM fibers relative to GM; and 4) similar GM/WM intensity values between 6-8 months, which reach adult values by 1 year of age. Another difficulty in applying a standardized approach is that the early infant brain experiences dramatic shifts in brain development over the span of weeks. This creates difficulty in adapting the few extant infant tissue atlases, generally limited to a single age, to guide segmentation of scans acquired at other, even proximal ages. Method(s): Recently a new technique-convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is a highly modifiable artificial intelligencebased image segmentation technique pioneered in the field of computer vision and medical imaging, which has been applied to MRI and shown to yield unprecedented levels of accuracy in automated tissue segmentation of adult scans, with similar potential demonstrated for infant scans when validated against manually traced images. To test and validate the idea of utilizing CNN to achieve accurate tissue segmentation for infants during 0 to 1 year old, we are planning to build a repository of high-quality, multimodal infant scans across a few institutions include Columbia, UCI, Brown, and Rochester University. But before the repository built up, we used 10 manual segmented structural MRI scans (T2) from Baby Connectome Project (BCP) challenge, 5 F/5 M, term born without any pathology (40+/-1 weeks of gestational age). MR scans were acquired on a Siemens head-only 3T scanners with a circularly polarized head coil. During the scan, infants were asleep, unsedated, fitted with ear protection, and their heads were secured in a vacuum-fixation device. Result(s): As proof-of-principle to examine the feasibility and promise of our proposed approach, we used a classic U-Net CNN approach utilizing the basic ResNet-34 encoder to segment the tissues of 2D axial T2 infant images. We built three separate binary classifiers corresponding to WM, GM, and CSF. 788 2D axial slices were used as training dataset, and 196 slices as validation dataset. As a comparison, we segmented the same scans using standard pipelines adapted for segmenting the infant brain-dHCP, SPM, and FAST. The performance of pipelines was calculated using the dice coefficient, and compared using ANOVA with post-hoc testing. As compared with standard pipelines, CNN delivered by far the best segmentation accuracy of tissues (GM, WM, and CSF, F(3,116)=197.9, p < 10-5, eta squared=0.84; post-hoc t-test p's < 10-5). Conclusion(s): In this project, we showed the feasibility and potentials of achieving better tissue segmentation with a convolutional neural network for the infant MRI scans. We aim to address several limitations to infant brain segmentation to generate a robust, age-diverse infant MRI training and validation set for CNN development and create an accurate and reliable CNN-based pipeline for infant brain segmentation in future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current situation of virus exposure risk incidents of nurses against corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, and to provide reference evidence for nursing managers to protect nursing staff who were working in the isolation ward. METHOD(S): In the study, 308 nursing staff against COVID-19 working in the isolation ward in Wuhan were conveniently selected to participate in the investigation. The designed questionnaires including 7 kinds of protective exposure risk events were made by the team of researchers on the basis of literature review and interview with the nurses in Wuhan. All the participants recalled their working experience in the status of dressing in personal protective equipment and filled in the questionnaires online by WeChat according to the same instruction. RESULT(S): The questionnaires were filled in validly by a total of 304 nursing staff, of whom 88.8% received emergency training on the prevention and dealing measurement of exposure risk events. The incidence of shoe cover contamination, falling off or torn was relatively high, about 53.6%. Due to the protection of gloves, the incidence of hand or skin contamination was relatively low, about 14.1%. The most nervousness of protective exposure risk event for nurses was N95 mask contamination, falling off or shifting, with a score of 8.2+/-2.3, showing a higher psychiatric burden. Single factor analysis found that the number of days in Wuhan was different, the number of the types of protective risk events occurred was different (chi2=14.562, P=0.024), orderly multivariate Logistic regression found that men were the independent protective factor for the number of the types of protective exposure risk events that occurred (P=0.019). CONCLUSION(S): Protective exposure risk events may occur in the work of nursing staff working in the isolation ward in Wuhan. It is necessary to guide nurses to prevent the occurrence of protective exposure risk events and effectively deal with them, so as to prevent virus exposure and reduce psycholo-gical burden.

AB  - Sensorineural hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder and a major health and socioeconomic issue in industrialized countries. It is primarily due to the degeneration of mechanosensory hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea via complex pathophysiological mechanisms. These occur following acute and/or chronic exposure to harmful extrinsic (e.g., ototoxic drugs, noise...) and intrinsic (e.g., aging, genetic) causative factors. No clinical therapies currently exist to rescue the dying sensorineural cells or regenerate these cells once lost. Recent studies have, however, provided renewed hope, with insights into the therapeutic targets allowing the prevention and treatment of ototoxic drug-and noise-induced, age-related hearing loss as well as cochlear cell degeneration. Moreover, genetic routes involving the replacement or corrective editing of mutant sequences or defected genes are showing promise, as are cell-replacement therapies to repair damaged cells for the future restoration of hearing in deaf people. This review begins by recapitulating our current understanding of the molecular pathways that underlie cochlear sensorineural damage, as well as the survival signaling pathways that can provide endogenous protection and tissue rescue. It then guides the reader through to the recent discoveries in pharmacological, gene and cell therapy research towards hearing protection and restoration as well as their potential clinical application.Copyright © 2018 American Physiological Society.

AB  - The way workers perceive noise exposure can play an important role in the adoption of safety behaviors. Therefore, the determination of the relationship among risk awareness, behavior, and exposure can be an extremely important issue in controlling noise exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between risk perception and practice of workers. Workers from 16 printing houses in Tehran province participated in present study. A questionnaire was used for determining the level of risk perception and practice about hearing conservation. The results revealed a significant relationship between risk perception and safety behavior adoption (P < 0.001). A positive and significant correlation was found between these two variables (P < 0.001; rs = 0.912). Also, the results showed that workers with hearing impairment had a better practice. In addition, attention should be paid to preventive principles and encouragement of hearing protection devices usage among employees.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: To date, factors associated with noise-induced hearing loss at music festivals have not yet been analyzed in a single comprehensive data set. In addition, little is known about the hearing loss-associated behavior of music festival attendees. OBJECTIVE(S):S To assess which factors are associated with the occurrence of a temporary threshold shift (TTS) after music exposure and to investigate the behavior of music festival attendees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective post hoc analysis gathered data from a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted on September 5, 2015, at an outdoor music festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Adult volunteers with normal hearing were recruited via social media from August 26 through September 3, 2015. Intention to use earplugs was an exclusion criterion. Of 86 volunteers assessed, 51 were included. This post hoc analysis was performed from October 3, 2016, through February 27, 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Music festival visit for 4.5 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a TTS on a standard audiogram for the frequencies 3.0- and 4.0-kHz. Multivariable linear regression was performed to determine which factors are associated with a TTS. A questionnaire on behavior, hearing, and tinnitus was distributed to the participants before and after the festival visit. RESULT(S): A total of 51 participants were included (18 men [35%] and 33 women [65%]) with a mean (SD) age of 27 (6) years. Mean (SD) threshold change across 3.0 and 4.0 kHz was 5.4 (5.7) dB for the right ear and 4.0 (6.1) dB for the left ear. Earplug use (absolute difference in the left ear, -6.0 dB [95% CI, -8.7 to-3.2 dB]; in the right ear, -6.4 dB [95% CI, -8.8 to-4.1 dB]), quantity of alcohol use (absolute difference per unit in the left ear, 1.1 dB [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.7 dB]; in the right ear, 0.7 dB [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.4 dB]), drug use (absolute difference in the right ear, 6.0 dB [95% CI, 0.9 to 11.1 dB]), and male sex (absolute difference in the right ear, 4.1 dB [95% CI, 0.3 to 5.9 dB]) were independently associated with hearing loss, with earplug use being the most important factor. Unprotected participants reported significantly worse subjective hearing performance and tinnitus after the festival visit than did participants using earplugs (Cramer V, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79] and 0.39 [95% CI, 0.16-0.62], respectively). In the earplug group, the perceived loudness (r = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.00 to-0.43) and appreciation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.78) of music and speech perception (r = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.35) were correlated with the duration of earplug use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The present study identified nonuse of earplugs, use of alcohol and drugs, and male sex as associated with a TTS at an outdoor music festival. Physicians should consider these factors to raise awareness about the combined risk of attending music festivals without using earplugs while consuming alcohol and/or drugs. The intention to use earplugs was correlated with the loudness and appreciation of music with earplugs, which may advocate for the use of personalized earplugs.Copyright © 2018 American Medical Association.

AB  - The use of production machinery in the industry is getting higher. Noise due to production machinery disturbs workers, resulting in hearing loss for workers. Deafness due to industrial noise is one of the diseases caused by work. The purpose of the study was to analyze noise intensity and analyze the benefits of earplug on hearing loss. This research is a quantitative study, the design used is a cross-sectional study. The population is workers at PT X who are exposed to noise intensity of 81-89 dB of 77 workers. Total population sampling technique. Data analysis using Spearman correlation (rs). The results of the analysis have no relationship to noise intensity with the right audiometry value (p-value = 0.895), there is no correlation between noise intensity and left audiometric measurements (p-value = 0.581). Workers use personal protective equipment so that noise intensity does not affect hearing function. Earplugs used when working are useful as barriers to protect hearing, able to reduce noise intensity by 30 dB. There is a relationship between right and left audiometry (p-value = 0,000). Decreasing the hearing power in the right ear will result in a decrease in hearing the power in the left ear, and vice versa. The auditory structure of the right and left ears has anatomically uninterrupted pathways (interconnected channels). Conclusion Earplugs function effectively to protect the ears from hearing loss, therefore it is highly recommended that you always use earplugs during work.Copyright © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - This Quasi experimental study was conducted with the objective to determine the effectiveness of preventive measures including awareness programme and use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) for the prevention and control of Noise Induced Hearing Loss among Oil and Gas field workers from January 2015 to March 2016. A total of 120 workers were selected by convenient sampling, and subjected to pure tone audiometry (PTA) to obtain hearing thresholds followed by intervention with HPDs and retesting a year later. The Mean pure tone thresholds on first visit was 21.19+/-11.60 dB in right and 24.66+/-13.26 dB in left ear, while means at second visit (after one year) were 20.65+/-10.44 dB and 21.45+/-11.74 dB for the right and left ears respectively with statistically significant difference (p=0.001) for the left ear on t-test. However the difference of frequency and percentage of the participants with normal and reduced hearing at both visits was significant (chi square P=0.001). Hearing protective devices (HPDs) are an effective means to prevent NIHL in workers of oil and gas fields.Copyright © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - A deterministic source of coherent single photons is an enabling device for quantum information processing. Quantum dots in nanophotonic structures have been employed as excellent sources of single photons with the promise of scaling up towards multiple photons and emitters. It remains a challenge to implement deterministic resonant optical excitation of the quantum dot required for generating coherent single photons, since residual light from the excitation laser should be suppressed without compromising source efficiency and scalability. Here, we present a planar nanophotonic circuit that enables deterministic pulsed resonant excitation of quantum dots using two orthogonal waveguide modes for separating the laser and the emitted photons. We report a coherent and stable single-photon source that simultaneously achieves high-purity (g(2)(0) = 0.020 +/- 0.005), high-indistinguishability (V = 96 +/- 2%), and >80% coupling efficiency into the waveguide. Such 'plug-and-play' single-photon source can be integrated with on-chip optical networks implementing photonic quantum processors.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Stochastic resonance (SR) has been proposed to play a major role in auditory perception, and to maintain optimal information transmission from the cochlea to the auditory system. By this, the auditory system could adapt to changes of the auditory input at second or even sub-second timescales. In case of reduced auditory input, somatosensory projections to the dorsal cochlear nucleus would be disinhibited in order to improve hearing thresholds by means of SR. As a side effect, the increased somatosensory input corresponding to the observed tinnitus-associated neuronal hyperactivity is then perceived as tinnitus. In addition, the model can also explain transient phantom tone perceptions occurring after ear plugging, or the Zwicker tone illusion. Vice versa, the model predicts that via stimulation with acoustic noise, SR would not be needed to optimize information transmission, and hence somatosensory noise would be tuned down, resulting in a transient vanishing of tinnitus, an effect referred to as residual inhibition.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous research utilising a between-subjects design has indicated that the use of noise-dampening ear protectors might enhance interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). In the present study, we further examined this effect using a repeated-measures, within-participants design, and investigated potential mechanisms that might explain the effect. 50 participants completed the heartbeat tracking task (HTT) with and without the use of industrial ear protectors, in a counter-balanced order. Participants were asked to count the number of heartbeats occurring in five discrete time intervals of 25, 35, 45, 55 and 95 s, without feeling for a manual pulse. HTT scores were significantly higher when ear protectors were worn, and the improvement in performance was greatest for participants with lower baseline IAcc. The ear protectors were associated with significantly increased self-reported heartbeat audibility, task-related confidence and concentration, and decreased levels of distractibility. Heartbeat audibility was also correlated with HTT performance when the ear protectors were worn. Because the use of industrial ear defenders resulted in increased heartbeat audibility, this manipulation should not be used to assess causal hypotheses related to changes in IAcc. However, it may serve as a simple, non-invasive manipulation to assess the effects of 'externalised' interoceptive signals.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Bright light therapy (BLT) is widely accepted as first-line treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). However, the mechanism of action of BLT is still widely unknown. On the other hand, in mammals, light penetrates the skull bone and reaches the brain, and extra ocular transcranial phototransduction has physiological influences such as changed reproductive cycles and increased brain serotonin levels. Therefore, we challenged the existing conceptual framework that light therapy would only be mediated through the eyes. Consequently, we run a pilot study on the putative effect of transcranial bright light in the treatment of SAD. The light was produced using light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which were attached to earplugs. The amount of photic energy was 6.0-8.5 lumens in both ear canals, and the length of treatment was 8 or 12 min five times a week during a four-week study period. Subjects were recruited through advertisements in the city of Oulu, Finland (latitude 65degree01'N) during 14 January 2009-03 February 2009. The final patient series consisted of 13 (aged 37.1 +/- 7.2 years) physically healthy indoor workers suffering from SAD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-21. Furthermore, severity of anxiety symptoms was measured by the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). The HAMD-17 mean sum score at screening was 23.1 +/- 1.6. Ten out of 13 SAD patients (76.9%) achieved full remission (i.e., HAMD-17 sum score <=7), and 92.3% (12/13) at least 50% reduction in HAMD-17 sum scores at "Week 4". By using a mixed regression model of repeated measures (AR-1) controlling for age, gender, and HAMD-17 mean sum score at screening, significant differences were found comparing the HAMD-17 mean sum scores of "Week 0" with the corresponding scores at the "Week 3" (t = -2.05, p = 0.045) and "Week 4" visit (t = -2.77, p = 0.008). Correspondingly, significant differences were found comparing the BDI-21 mean sum scores (15.2 +/- 6.7) of "Week 0" with the corresponding scores at the "Week 3" (t = -2.37, p = 0.021) and "Week 4" visit (t = -3.65, p < 0.001). The HAMA mean sum score at screening was 20.5 +/- 5.4. During the study period, 12 out of 13 (92.3%) patients achieved at least 50% reduction in their HAMA sum scores, and in 10 out of 13 patients (76.9%), the HAMA sum score was <7. In conclusion, it is hard to believe that our findings could be explained solely by placebo effect. Consequently, the basic assumptions underlying extraocular photoreception in humans deserve to be reconsidered. Given that a proper placebo treatment can be implemented via ear canals, further investigations with randomized placebo-controlled and/or dose-finding study designs regarding the extraocular transcranial bright light in the treatment of SAD are called for. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Does wearing musicians' earplugs while performing affect the quality of the performance? Can listeners perceive a difference in sound when musicians are performing with or without earplugs? The risk of hearing loss is a concern for musicians, but some are reluctant to wear hearing protection due to factors such as an inability to hear their own instrument properly and the possibility of decreased sound quality for listeners. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of musicians' earplugs on instrumental pitch accuracy and the perception of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast, as perceived by musicians and listeners. METHOD(S): Ten university studio faculty teachers were recorded performing single pitches and lyrical and technical passages, first without earplugs and then immediately after with earplugs. A sample of 8 studio faculty teachers and 88 undergraduate music education students completed a researcher-created music perception test of tone quality, intonation, and dynamic contrast. RESULT(S): Objective analyses of the single pitch recordings made by faculty with and without earplugs indicate that pitch accuracy did not favor either condition consistently. Results from the perception test indicate that although both faculty and student listeners perceived some differences, the most frequent perception was that the audio pair was equal, and there was no clear difference between performing with and without earplugs in terms of tone quality, intonation, or dynamic contrast. CONCLUSION(S): These findings suggest that musicians should feel confident that wearing musicians' earplugs while performing does not adversely affect pitch accuracy or listeners' perceptions of their timbre and dynamic control.

AB  - Background: The understanding of the relationship between risk perception, knowledge, and protective behaviors could play a major role in occupational risk control and management. Research exploring how workers perceive, recognize, and react to risks in different occupational settings is scarce in Thailand. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of noise-related risk perceptions and knowledge to the use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) among sawmill workers in Thailand. Method(s): Sawmill workers (n = 540) from four factories in Trang, Southern Thailand, participated in a questionnaire interview from December 2015 to January 2016. Descriptive statistics and linear regression models were used to explore the risk factors related to HPD use. Path diagram analysis was demonstrated and used to evaluate associations. Result(s): Risk perception was significantly correlated with HPD use (p < 0.01), HPD training (p = 0.01), and the number of years of work experience (p = 0.03). Sawmill workers were likely to use HPDs based on their risk perception and HPD training. However, HPD training was inversely correlated with age and the number of years of work experience. Conclusion(s): The study highlights the importance of risk perceptions and knowledge, and these factors should be emphasized in the design and implementation of any personal safety intervention program for sawmill workers.Copyright © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Exposure to hazardous noise is one of the most common occupational risks, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Repeated overexposure to noise at or above 85 dBA can cause permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, and difficulty understanding speech in noise. It is also associated with cardiovascular disease, depression, balance problems, and lower income. About 22 million U.S. workers are currently exposed to hazardous occupational noise. Approximately 33% of working-age adults with a history of occupational noise exposure have audiometric evidence of noise-induced hearing damage, and 16% of noise-exposed workers have material hearing impairment. While the Mining, Construction, and Manufacturing sectors typically have the highest prevalence of noise exposure and hearing loss, there are noise-exposed workers in every sector and every sector has workers with hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss is preventable. Increased understanding of the biological processes underlying noise damage may lead to protective pharmacologic or genetic therapies. For now, an integrated public health approach that (1) emphasizes noise control over reliance on hearing protection, (2) illustrates the full impact of hearing loss on quality of life, and (3) challenges the cultural acceptance of loud noise can substantially reduce the impact of noise on worker health.

AB  - There is growing interest in combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG). Because TMS pulses are accompanied by a clicking sound, it is very likely that part of the response in the EEG consists of an auditory evoked potential (AEP). Different methods have been applied to mask the sound of TMS. However, it is unclear which masking method is most effective in reducing the AEP. In this study we explore the presumed contribution of the AEP to the response and evaluate different ways to mask the TMS clicking sound. Twelve healthy subjects and one completely deaf subject participated in this study. Eight different masking conditions were evaluated in nine hearing subjects. The amplitude of the N100-P180 complex was compared between the different masking conditions. We were not able to completely suppress the N100-P180 when the coil was placed on top of the head. Using an earmuff or exposing the subjects to white or adapted noise caused a small but significant reduction in N100-P180 amplitude, but the largest reduction was achieved when combining a layer of foam, placed between coil and head, with white or adapted noise. The deaf subject also showed a N100-P180 complex. We conclude that both the TMS clicking sound and cortical activation by the magnetic pulse contribute to the N100-P180 amplitude. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This Cochrane Corner features "Interventions to prevent hearing loss caused by noise at work", published in 2017. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if hearing loss caused by noise at work is being prevented by current interventions. Tikka et al. identified 29 studies that studied the effect of preventive measures. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure, eleven studies evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). There was some very low-quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces and moderate-quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short-term follow-up. This Cochrane review has identified specific strategies that have shown effectiveness in reducing workplace noise, such as the implementation of stricter legislation and the need for training in the proper use of earplugs and earmuffs to reduce noise exposure to safe levels. The overall quality of evidence for the effectiveness of HLPPs in preventing hearing loss was very low, there was limited follow-up of participants receiving training for insertion of earplugs and no controlled studies examining engineering controls to reduce workplace noise.

AB  - Objective: To investigate hearing protection devices (HPDs) use and its relationship with hearing loss among steel industry workers in Thailand. Material(s) and Method(s): The present cross-sectional study included 93 eligible participants who are working in the designated high-noise-level zones, which is 85 or more A-weighted decibels [dB(A)] for eight hours time-weighted average, of the two factories. Self-report forms were used to obtain HPDs use by industry workers and noise exposure level was measured with Spark (Model 706) noise dosimeter. Audiometric screening for hearing loss was performed at a regional hospital by the qualified technician. The hearing loss in each ear was defined if the average threshold level was found to have exceeded 25 dB(A) at high frequencies of 4 and 6 kHz. Result(s): The findings showed that 45.2% of workers used earplug, 16.1% used earmuff, and 38.7% used both, and most workers (55.8%) wear HDPs regularly, for six of seven days per week. Fifty seven percent of workers wear HDPs for more than 60% time of an 8-hour work shift. Most workers (75.2%) have hearing loss. Conclusion(s): The authors' result revealed that almost half of workers used hearing protection devices and most workers use HPDs during the 8-hour work time. Abnormal hearing ability were found among workers. The education program such as the hazards of noise on potential auditory loss, a noise education training program and full use of HPDs are encouraged to prevent effect of noise on workers.Copyright © JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Discrepancies between attenuation obtained in the laboratory and the field are caused by several factors associated with hearing protection devices (HPDs). The effects of some factors can be minimized with proper training provided to HPD users. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention for improving the correct use of earplugs as HPDs in workers exposed to occupational noise by using the F-MIRE method and by comparing pre- and post-training attenuation values and pass/fail rates. METHODOLOGY: The personal attenuation ratings (PARs) of two types of earplugs were obtained (140 individuals) using E-A-RfitTM equipment. Each HPD was evaluated under two scenarios: first after the user only read the packaging instructions, and then after the user read guidelines and participated in a training program. The results obtained were automatically classified by the software as "Approved" or "Failed". RESULT(S): There was a significant post-training increase in the binaural PAR values for both HPDs. The percentages of passes pre- and post-training showed that training users in the proper fit of the HPD was effective; both types had statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION(S): This study found a statistically significant increase in PARs and the number of workers passing evaluations after HPD fit training, demonstrating the effectiveness of this educational intervention.

However, there is little evidence of the impact of noise on the hearing of younger children. This study aimed to explore an association between PMP use and hearing, and to identify other sources of noise among children. The study sample consisted of 1032 children aged 11-12 years old. Hearing thresholds were determined from 0.5 to 8 kHz. PMP use and other noise exposures were evaluated using a survey. We found that 82% of the children had a PMP, and 78% were exposed to noise when playing computer games. An audiometric notch was documented in 1.3% of the children. Only 11.5% of the children ever used hearing protection while engaged in noisy activities. We found no convincing evidence of an association between PMP use and hearing thresholds, although our results suggest that tinnitus may be an early sign of NIHL in young children. The study shows a need to provide children, their parents, and educators with knowledge of how to take care of hearing, including how to avoid and minimize noise exposure.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To determine the short-term effects of supplying hospital inpatients with earplugs and eye masks, preparatory to a full-scale trial. DESIGN:: A single-centre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, randomized-controlled trial. SETTING:: A total of 13 medical and surgical wards in a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS:: Everyone admitted to hospital aged 18years or older, who stayed overnight and had the mental capacity and sufficient understanding of English to give consent, the ability to complete the study questionnaire and the ability to use earplugs and eye masks unaided was considered. INTERVENTIONS:: The intervention group was provided with earplugs and eye masks for use the following night, and the control group received standard care. MAIN MEASURES:: Sleep quality assessed using the SleepSure questionnaire after the first night of using the intervention, use of earplugs and eye masks, number of falls throughout their inpatient stay, use of zopiclone during inpatient stay, length of stay and recruitment rate. RESULT(S):: A total of 1600 patients were admitted; out of which, 626 (39%) were eligible and 206 (13% total, 33% eligible) recruited (intervention group, 109). The intervention group's mean sleep quality score was 6.33 (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.89-6.77), compared with 5.09 (95% CI: 4.66-5.52) in the control group ( p<0.001). There were no differences in use of zopiclone, falls or length of stay between the groups. Of the intervention group, 91 (86%) reported using the earplugs and/or eye masks. CONCLUSION(S):: The intervention seems feasible, and effective, but trial eligibility rate and rate of recruitment into the study were limited.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There have been concerns about increasing levels of hearing impairment in children and adolescents, especially in relation to noise exposure, because even mild levels of hearing loss can affect educational outcomes. OBJECTIVE(S): To further characterize changes in prevalence of hearing loss and noise exposures in the US pediatric population over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective analysis of demographic and audiometric data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994), NHANES 2005-2006, NHANES 2007-2008, and NHANES 2009-2010. The NHANES are nationally representative survey data sets collected and managed by the US National Center for Health Statistics, and this study includes a total of 7036 survey participants ages 12 to 19 years with available audiometric measurements. EXPOSURES: Hearing-related behaviors and risk factors such as history of ear infections, noise exposures, firearm use, and hearing protection use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Level of hearing loss measured by pure-tone audiometry, as well as high-frequency and low-frequency hearing loss and noise-induced threshold shifts. RESULT(S): Overall, data from 7036 survey participants ages 12 to 19 years with available audiometric measurements were analyzed. The prevalence of hearing loss increased from NHANES III to NHANES 2007-2008 (17.0% to 22.5% for >15 dB hearing loss; absolute difference, 5.5%; 95% CI, 6.1%-10.3%) but decreased in the NHANES 2009-2010 to 15.2% (absolute difference, 7.2%; 95% CI, 2.0%-12.4%) with no significant overall secular trend identified. There was an overall rise in exposure to loud noise or music through headphones 24 hours prior to audiometric testing from NHANES III to NHANES 2009-2010. However, noise exposure, either prolonged or recent, was not consistently associated with an increased risk of hearing loss across all surveys. The most recent survey cycle showed that nonwhite race/ethnicity and low socioeconomic status are independent risk factors for hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This analysis did not identify significant changes in prevalence of hearing loss in US youth ages 12 to 19 years over this time period despite increases in reported noise exposures. No consistent associations were shown between noise exposure and hearing loss, though there was an association between racial/ethnic minority status and low socioeconomic status and increased risk of hearing loss. Ongoing monitoring of hearing loss in this population is necessary to elucidate long-term trends and identify targets for intervention.Copyright © 2017 American Medical Association.

AB  - Introduction Noise pollution is an often source of environmental stress that can increase the risk of important health conditions, including: hearing loss, stress, sleep disturbances or altering sleep wake balance, heart disease. A 5 decibel noise reduction could reduce the prevalence of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease, as well as the annual major economic savings. Methods We monitored 640 textile workers (617 women, caucazians), on the occasion of the annual medical examination, over a three-year period. Audiograms were made to all employees, at the same time with official determination of the noise level, carried out by the Public Health Authority of the county. In selected cases, the workers were also led to specialised examinations (cardiology, neurological, psychiatric, ENT). Results Official noise level determinations have shown overtaking in many of the technological process points (ironing presses, buttonhole machines, edge banding, staple machines etc.). In situations where workers were rotated at short intervals (30 days), they showed minimal symptoms of high-loud exposure. In situations where workers had fixed workstations, after three years of exposure, a decrease with 5-10 dB(A) in auditory acuity was observed, associated with sleep disturbances, nervousness and irritability, a slight increase in blood pressure, at about 20% of the employees (especially if they were over 50 years old and worked in the noise before). During week-ends and holidays, everyone was feeling good. Discussion The textile industry is an important sector of concentration of professional high-noise exposure pathology. Technical and organisational measures (risk recognition, wearing individual hearing protection equipment, resting in quiet rooms, separation of noise-generating technology processes, high-tech equipment), as well as medical ones (decrease in headphones use, health education, thorough medical checks), lead to better management of the negative impact of human health noise.

AB  - Noise exposure and the subsequent hearing loss are well documented aspects of military life. Numerous studies have indicated high rates of noise-induced hearing injury (NIHI) in active-duty service men and women, and recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicate a population of veterans with hearing loss that is growing at an increasing rate. In an effort to minimize hearing loss, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) updated its Hearing Conservation Program in 2010, and also has recently revised the DoD Design Criteria Standard Noise Limits (MIL-STD-1474E) which defines allowable noise levels in the design of all military acquisitions including weapons and vehicles. Even with such mandates, it remains a challenge to accurately quantify the noise exposure experienced by a Warfighter over the course of a mission or training exercise, or even in a standard work day. Noise dosimeters are intended for exactly this purpose, but variations in device placement (e.g., free-field, on-body, in/near-ear), hardware (e.g., microphone, analog-to-digital converter), measurement time (e.g., work day, 24-h), and dose metric calculations (e.g., time-weighted energy, peak levels, Auditory Risk Units), as well as noise types (e.g., continuous, intermittent, impulsive) can cause exposure measurements to be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate for a given situation. This paper describes the design of a noise dosimeter capable of acquiring exposure data across tactical environments. Two generations of prototypes have been built at MIT Lincoln Laboratory with funding from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Details related to hardware, signal processing, and testing efforts are provided, along with example tactical military noise data and lessons learned from early fieldings. Finally, we discuss the continued need to prioritize personalized dosimetry in order to improve models that predict or characterize the risk of auditory damage, to integrate dosimeters with hearing-protection devices, and to inform strategies and metrics for reducing NIHI.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Noise-induced hearing loss is the most preventable cause of auditory impairment. Periodic audiometric evaluations are essential to monitor the hearing health of noise-exposed workers. Objective(s): To compare the evolution of audiometric thresholds in the initial three evaluations at frequencies of 3, 4, and 6 kHz in groups of workers exposed or not to noise. Method(s): In this historical cohort study, audiometric evaluations were obtained from male workers between 18 and 40 years of age at six different metallurgical companies in Brazil. The workers were separated into noise-exposed and non-noise-exposed groups. The mean thresholds for 3, 4, and 6 kHz were calculated for both ears at baseline and the first and second periodic evaluations. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 1,382 metallurgical workers were evaluated (1,199 noise-exposed and 183 non-noise-exposed). There was a significant difference between baseline and the first periodic evaluation (right ear - effect size = 0.62; p = 0.0030 and left ear - effect size = 0.74; p = 0.0063) and between baseline and the second periodic evaluation (right ear - effect size = 0.85; p = 0.004 and left ear - effect size = 0.96; p = 0.0002). In the non-noise-exposed group, there was no difference between baseline and the first periodic evaluation (right ear - effect size = 0.18; p = 0.2703 and left ear - effect size = 0.12; p = 0.7907) and between baseline and the second periodic evaluation (right ear - effect size = 0.29; p = 0.4475 and left ear - effect size = 0.41; p = 0.6381). Conclusion(s): In noise-exposed workers, there was a significant worsening of audiometric thresholds between baseline and the initial periodic evaluation, but there was no difference between the two post-baseline evaluations. This shows that noise exposure can quickly affect hearing, despite protective measures.Copyright © 2020

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate that brief exposure to subway noise causes temporary threshold shift and is preventable with noise protection. Method(s): The study was conducted as a randomized crossover trial. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, one with hearing protection and one without. Subjects were exposed to subway platform noise for 15 minutes. Pre- and post-exposure pure tone audiometry (PTA) and otoacoustic emissions were compared. After a washout period, subjects switched hearing protection groups and repeated the process. Result(s): A statistically significant reduction in PTA thresholds after subway noise exposure was identified, for subjects with and without hearing protection (P <.001). For exposure without hearing protection, the mean threshold was 5.19 dB pre-exposure and 3.91 dB post-exposure (decrease of 1.28 dB; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.74). For exposure with hearing protection, the mean threshold was 4.81 dB pre-exposure and 3.47 dB post-exposure (decrease of 1.34 dB; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.79). Conclusion(s): Brief exposure to subway noise did not cause hearing loss with or without noise protection. Though clinically insignificant, the unexpected finding of reduction in PTA suggests that there are complex heterogeneous short- and long-term cochlear responses to noise exposure that should be further explored.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic tool that can be optimized to display a wide range of clinical conditions. An MRI system consists of four major components: a main magnet formed by superconducting coils, gradient coils, radiofrequency (RF) coils, and computer systems. Each component has safety considerations. Unless carefully controlled, the MRI machine's strong static magnetic field could turn a ferromagnetic object into a harmful projectile or cause vertigo and headache. Switching magnetic fields in the gradients evokes loud noises in the scanner, which can be mitigated by ear protection. Gradients also generate varying magnetic fields that can cause peripheral nerve stimulation and muscle twitching. Magnetic fields produced by RF coils deposit energy in the body and can cause tissue heating (with the potential to cause skin burns). In this review, we provide an overview of the components of a typical clinical MRI scanner and its associated safety issues. We also discuss how the relationship between the scanning parameters can be manipulated to improve image quality while ensuring a safe operational environment for the patients and staff. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these parameters can enable users to choose optimal techniques for image acquisition, apply them in clinical practice, and improve the diagnostic accuracy of an MRI examination.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Young musicians may be at risk for developing cochlear synaptopathy (CS), or hidden hearing loss (HHL), that could lead to permanent music-induced hearing loss (MIHL). Patients with CS often complain of tinnitus and/or difficulty understanding speech in noisy situations, even though traditional audiometric testing indicates normal hearing. The aim of this article was to determine the effects of including information about HHL on an Adopt-A-Band program involving college band members' concern about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. We conducted a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Forty-eight band members participated in this study. Band members were randomly assigned to two Adopt-A-Band presentations, one with and one without information on HHL. Including information about HHL had no effect on these band members' concerns about and self-efficacy toward the prevention of MIHL. However, the Adopt-A-Band program resulted in significantly increased concern for MIHL by 39.5% (p < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 25-54.2), self-efficacy in its prevention by 79.1% (p < 0.0001, 95% CI: 66.9-91.2), and plans to use musicians' earplugs while playing by 67.4% (p < 0.0001, 95% CI: 53.4-81.45). Although inclusion of information about HHL did not have a significant effect, the Adopt-A-Band program, in general, significantly increased the immediate intent of these students to practice healthy hearing behaviors. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of using the Adopt-A-Band program with university marching bands' use of healthy hearing behaviors.Copyright © 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study utilized personal noise measurements and fit-testing to evaluate the association between noise exposures and personal attenuation rating (PAR) values among participating workers, and second, to compare the attenuated exposure levels received by the workers and the British Standards Institute's recommended noise exposure range of 70 to 80 dBA. DESIGN: We measured hearing protection device (HPD) attenuation among a sample of 91 workers at 2 US metal manufacturing facilities, through performance of personal noise dosimetry measurements and HPD fit-testing over multiple work shifts. We compared this testing with participant questionnaires and annual audiometric hearing threshold results. RESULT(S): The average 8-hr time-weighted average noise exposures for study participants was 79.8 dBA (SD = 7.0 dBA), and the average PAR from fit-testing was 20.1 dB (+/-6.7 dB). While differences existed between sites, 84% of the 251 PAR measurements resulted in effective protection levels below the recommended 70 dBA (indicating overprotection), while workers were underprotected (i.e., effective exposures >80 dBA) during <1% of monitored shifts. Our results also demonstrated a significant positive relationship between measured noise exposure and PAR among non-custom-molded plug users (p = 0.04). Non-custom-molded plug wearers also showed a significant increase in PAR by sequential fit-test interaction (p = 0.01), where on average, subsequent fit-testing resulted in increasingly higher HPD attenuation. Workers at site 1 showed higher PARs. PARs were significantly related to race, even when adjusting for site location. While age, hearing threshold level, task, and self-reported tinnitus showed no significant effect on individual PAR in an unadjusted model, site, race, and sand- or water-blasting activities were significant predictors in adjusted models. Within-worker variability in time-weighted averages and PARs across repeated measurements was substantially lower than variability between workers. CONCLUSION(S): Careful selection of HPDs is necessary to minimize instances of overprotection to workers in low and moderate occupational noise environments. The use of fit-testing in hearing conservation programs to evaluate PAR is recommended to avoid overprotection from noise exposure while also minimizing instances of under-attenuation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study characterised overall and specific costs associated with hearing conservation programmes (HCPs) at US metal manufacturing sites, and examined the association between these costs and several noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) outcomes. DESIGN: We interviewed personnel and reviewed records at participating facilities. We also measured noise for comparison to the ten-year average of measurements made by each facility. NIHL outcomes assessed included rates of standard threshold shifts (STS) and high-frequency hearing loss, as well as prevalence of hearing impairment, for each participating facility. We used linear regression to identify per-person HCP costs that best predicted the NIHL outcomes. STUDY SAMPLE: We evaluated 14US metal manufacturing facilities operated by a single company. RESULT(S): Annual HCP costs ranged from roughly $67,000 to $397,000 (average $308+/-80 per worker). Our full-shift noise measurements (mean 83.1 dBA) showed good agreement with the facilities' measurements (mean 82.6 dBA). Hearing impairment prevalence was about 15% overall. Higher expenditures for training and hearing protector fit-testing were significantly associated with reduced STS prevalence. Higher training expenditures were also related to lower hearing impairment prevalence and high-frequency hearing loss rates. CONCLUSION(S): HCP costs were substantial and variable. Increased workplace spending on training and fit-testing may help minimise NIHL.

AB  - Silica and noise are highly prevalent occupational exposures in the stone processing industry. Monitoring for silica and noise are expensive tasks that may be especially difficult to perform in low-resource settings, but exposure awareness is vital for protecting worker health. This study evaluated personal noise and silica measurements at a stone processing facility in northern Thailand to investigate the differing exposure potentials and risk for overexposure among the varying job categories. Our research team performed repeated personal noise and respirable silica measurements on 46 workers, over three separate workshifts for each of 46 workers. While 36.2% of noise measurements exceeded the recommended exposure limit of 85 dBA, only three silica measurements (2.4%) were above the threshold limit value (TLV) of 25 microg/m3. Self-reported personal protective equipment use was low, with only 27.5% of participants wearing hearing protection in noisy environments during their monitored shift and 29.7% of workers wearing respiratory protection during dusty portions of their shift. We identified a significant positive correlation between measured noise and silica levels (r = 0.54, p < 0.01), with stone loaders having the highest average noise (mean = 89 dBA, standard deviation = 4.9 dBA) and silica (geometric mean = 6.4 microg/m3, geometric standard deviation = 1.8) exposure levels. In a multivariate model, the stone loader job category was a significant predictor of exposure to detectable levels of respirable silica (p < 0.01). These results provide useful guidance regarding the need for noise and silica exposure interventions in order to reduce incidences of workplace disease in the stone processing industry.

AB  - Background: In underserved areas, it is crucial to investigate ways of increasing access to hearing health care. The community health worker (CHW) is a model that has been applied to increase access in various health arenas. This article proposes further investigation into the application of this model to audiology. Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility of training CHWs about hearing loss as a possible approach to increase accessibility of hearing health support services in an underserved area. Research Design: A specialized three-phase training process for CHWs was developed, implemented, and evaluated by audiologists and public health researchers. The training process included (1) focus groups with CHWs and residents from the community to raise awareness of hearing loss among CHWs and the community; (2) a 3-hr workshop training to introduce basic topics to prepare CHWs to identify signs of hearing loss among community members and use effective communication strategies; and (3) a 24-hr multisession, interactive training .6 weeks for CHWs who would become facilitators of educational and peer-support groups for individuals with hearing loss and family members. Study Sample: Twelve Spanish-speaking local CHWs employed by a federally qualified health center participated in a focus group, twelve received the general training, and four individuals with prior experience as health educators received further in-person training as facilitators of peer-education groups on hearing loss and communication. Data Collection and Analysis: Data was collected from each step of the three-phase training process. Thematic analysis was completed for the focus group data. Pre-and posttraining assessments and case study discussions were used to analyze results for the general workshop and the in-depth training sessions. Result(s): CHWs increased their knowledge base and confidence in effective communication strategies and developed skills in facilitating hearing education and peer-support groups. Through case study practice, CHWs demonstrated competencies and applied their learning to specific situations related to effective communication with hearing loss, family support, availability of assistive technology, use of hearing protection, and making referrals for hearing health care. Needs were identified for ongoing training in the area of use of assistive technology and addressing situations of more severe hearing loss and its effects. Conclusion(s): Initial results suggest it is feasible to train CHWs to engage community members regarding hearing loss and facilitate culturally relevant peer-health education and peer-support groups for individuals with hearing loss and their family members. In efforts to increase access to audiological services in rural or underserved communities, application of the CHW model with a partnership of audiologists deserves further consideration as a viable approach.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to analyze and compare four different types of earplugs, divided into premolded plugs and foam plug models, in relation to the level of attenuation, comfort, and the size of the external acoustic meatus (EAM) in an attempt to identify how these variables influence the choice of specific hearing protection devices (HPDs). Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional observational study was performed in a sample of 49 participants, oriented toward the ideal placement of four HPDs, two premolded and two foam plugs (3MTM). The procedures included otoscopy, EAM diameter measurement using an otometer, EAM volume measurement via an acoustic impedance test, and the obtainment of the bilateral personal attenuation rating (PAR) for each HPD using the E-A-RfitTM Validation System (3MTM). The Bipolar Comfort Rating Scale (BCRS) instrument was applied twice for each individual: once after the evaluations with the premolded HPDs and again after the evaluations with the foam plug HPDs. Then, each participant was asked which was his/her favorite protector. Result(s): The volume of the EAM was not directly related to the diameter of the EAM. The attenuation did not interfere with the HPD preference, and the PAR of the foam plug was significantly higher regardless of the preferred HPD. Regarding the BCRS, the variables "Placement," "Complexity," and "Occlusion Effect" had higher scores for premolded HPDs and had a direct relationship with the type of preferred HPD. Conclusion(s): Attention to the use of HPDs should be personalized, taking into account the needs of each individual, considering not only the attenuation, but also the user's reported well-being.

AB  - The performance of sound barriers was evaluated to determine their technical effectiveness and practicality in reducing noise exposures to operating engineers in construction. Commercially purchased sound dampening mats (SDMats) were installed inside three heavy-equipment engine compartments. Sound pressure levels (SPLs) were measured before and after installing the SDMats while the equipment was on idle and full-throttle settings where it normally operates. SPLs inside the heavy-equipment operator cabs were significantly reduced by 5.6-7.6 dBA on the full-throttle setting following installation of the SDMats (p < 0.01). The evaluated engineering control intervention was simple to install, affordable, and substantially reduced the engine noise reaching the heavy-equipment operator, potentially reducing reliance on hearing-protection devices to protect construction workers from noise exposures.Copyright © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The increase in the incidence of ocular discomfort has primarily been attributed to: contact lens wear, refractive surgery, meibomian gland dysfunction, and the aging population. Efforts to diagnose, treat and understand the underlying causes have been impeded by a lack of suitable methods to quantify ocular surface sensitivity. Traditional instruments are either inaccurate, difficult to use or not generally available. A new method is presented that utilizes a liquid jet to generate a precisely controlled stimulus to the ocular surface. The stimuli are adjustable in strength to determine sensitivity thresholds for either mechanical, thermal or chemical stimulation. Technical details are described and calibration methods and results are presented for three modes of operation. At the heart of the instrument is a microprocessor controlled microvalve which can operate at a frequency of up to 4 kHz to precisely control flow of the ejected liquid. The stimulus strength can be varied either by the ejected volume or the velocity. Repeatability for the ejected volume was established over a range of different control parameter settings: temperature, pressure, working distance, operating mode and volume. For 10 repeats, the maximum standard deviation was less than 3% of the mean of ejected volume for any particular setting. The maximum error for the lateral targeting of the liquid jet for the 30 mm distance between nozzle and target surface was less than +/-0.5 mm. A simplified mathematical model is presented to physically quantify the stimulus strength. Based on the liquid jet concept, a new instrument was developed and technically validated that can apply a precisely controlled stimulus to an ocular surface to determine mechanical, and potentially thermal and chemical sensitivity threshold levels. The strength and the positioning of the applied stimulus can be precisely controlled. Temporal and spatial aspects of corneal sensation can also be investigated with this new instrument.Copyright © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The use of models to predict the effect of blast-like impulses on hearing function is an ongoing topic of investigation relevant to hearing protection and hearing-loss prevention in the modern military. The first steps in the hearing process are the collection of sound power from the environment and its conduction through the external and middle ear into the inner ear. Present efforts to quantify the conduction of high-intensity sound power through the auditory periphery depend heavily on modeling. This paper reviews and elaborates on several existing models of the conduction of high-level sound from the environment into the inner ear and discusses the shortcomings of these models. A case is made that any attempt to more accurately define the workings of the middle ear during high-level sound stimulation needs to be based on additional data, some of which has been recently gathered.

AB  - Aimed at preventing heat strain, health problems, and absenteeism among workers with physically demanding occupations, a continuous, accurate, non-invasive measuring system may help such workers monitor their body (core) temperature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and explore the usability of the wearable non-invasive Cosinussdegree degreeTemp thermometer. Ear canal temperature was monitored in 49 workers in real-life working conditions. After individual correction, the results of the laboratory and field study revealed high correlations compared to ear canal infrared thermometry for hospital use. After performance of the real-life working tasks, this correlation was found to be moderate. It was also observed that the ambient environmental outdoor conditions and personal protective clothing influenced the accuracy and resulted in unrealistic ear canal temperature outliers. It was found that the Cosinussdegree degreeTemp thermometer did not result in significant interference during work. Therefore, it was concluded that, without a correction factor, the Cosinussdegree degreeTemp thermometer is inaccurate. Nevertheless, with a correction factor, the reliability of this wearable ear canal thermometer was confirmed at rest, but not in outdoor working conditions or while wearing a helmet or hearing protection equipment.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: To compare speech intelligibility in noise with and without hearing protection device (HPD). Material(s) and Method(s): 51 workers were distributed into three groups: noise-induced hearing loss (NIHLG), normally hearing noise-exposed (NG), and normally hearing nonexposed to noise (CG). A free field system was used to emit monosyllables (65, 70, 75 dB) and pink noise in different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (0, -5, -10, -15). Result(s): In situations with HPD, all groups had a decrease in the percentage of correct responses with an increase in noise level. It was observed that the HPD had little effect on speech intelligibility in the NIHLG and NG. Considering the effect caused by the HPD on speech intelligibility, it was observed that the group that had the greatest loss was the CG in the SNR of -5, -10, and -15. Conclusion(s): Although the speech intelligibility is influenced by the hearing threshold, the noise level and SNR are crucial to a good speech intelligibility, either with or without an HPD. It is highlighted that the NG had worse results when compared with the CG, which may indicate changes in the auditory pathway resulting from continuous noise exposure, even in the absence of changes in the audiometric thresholds.

AB  - Study Objectives: To determine if differences exist between faculty, residents, and nurses regarding night shift preparation, recovery, and perception. Method(s): The study was performed during April 2017 at an urban university medical center ED with an accredited residency program in emergency medicine. Surveys with specific questions regarding night shift habits and opinions were distributed to subjects in paper form and collected after completion. Participation was voluntary, and anonymity of subjects was assured. chi-square, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze differences between the 3 groups. Result(s): A total of 45 faculty, 29 residents, and 90 nurses completed the survey. The majority (> 70%) in all 3 groups reported having a night shift preparatory routine. There was no significant difference in proportion of use of earplugs, background "white" noise, ergonomic pillows, eye masks, and humidifiers between the 3 groups. However, faculty utilized blackout curtains more (80%; 95% CI: 59.3-93.2) than Residents (58.6%; 95% CI: 38.9-76.5) and nurses (68.9%; 95% CI: 58.3-78.2; P = 0.02). Bedroom temperature preference (Fahrenheit) was similar (P = 0.36) between Faculty (67.6 i 2.3degree), residents (66.8 i 2.9degree), and nurses (67.9 i 3.2degree). The use of pharmacologic sleep aids differed (P = 0.02) between the 3 groups, with 39 (86.7%; 95% CI: 73.2-94.9) faculty, 18 (62.1%; 95% CI: 42.3-79.3) residents, and 66 (733%; 95% CI: 62.9-82.1) nurses reporting non-use. Residents routinely used melatonin as a sleep aid at a higher proportion (31%; 95% CI: 15.3-50.8) than did Faculty (4.4%; 95% CI: 0.5-15.2) and nurses (14.4%; 95% CI: 7.9-23.4; P = 0.006). All 3 groups most commonly reported prior use of diphenhydramine, melatonin, and alcohol, but they did not necessarily use these agents on a routine basis as sleep aids. Most faculty (n = 18, 40%; 95% CI: 25.7-55.7) did not eat prior to their night shift, whereas residents (n = 9, 31%; 95% CI: 15.3-50.8) and nurses (n = 33, 36.7%; 95% CI: 26.7-47.5) preferred to eat a small meal. The majority (> 70%) in all 3 groups drank coffee before their night shift, followed by energy drinks as second preference. The majority of all 3 groups reported feeling tired despite their routine, with 4:00 AM most commonly reported among all groups as the time at which their alertness reached a nadir. Faculty reported a significantly (P = 0.05) higher rate (42.2%; 95% CI: 27.7-57.9) of falling asleep while driving home compared to Residents (13.8%; 95% CI: 3.9-31.7) and nurses (32.2%; 95% CI: 22.7-42.9), but the accident rate (3.4-6.7%) did not differ significantly between the 3 groups. All 3 groups had similar opinions regarding night shift-associated alteration of circadian rhythm, longevity, stress, ageing, depression, and drug/alcohol use. However, faculty reported lower level of satisfaction (median = 3, 1-5 Likert scale; IQR: 2-4) working night shifts than did residents (4; IQR 2.5-4.5) and nurses (4; IQR: 2-5; P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Faculty, residents, and nurses share many characteristics regarding preparation, recovery and perception of night shift effects on mental and physical health. Most differences involved faculty, who tended to use blackout curtains, not use pharmacologic sleep aids, not eat prior to their night shift, fall asleep at a higher rate while driving home, and enjoy night shift work less compared to residents and nurses. Residents relied on melatonin as a routine sleep aid more than faculty and nurses.

AB  - The perception of sound is a highly individual phenomenom that depends on both external factors (e.g., noise, reverberation, or signal transmission quality) and internal factors (e.g., hearing loss, sound preferences, or language proficiency). In particular, speech communication can be impaired in many situations. While medical hearing aids can be beneficial in many situations for people with hearing loss, they cannot solve communication problems for people with audiologically normal hearing or the so-called subclinical population with mild, untreated hearing loss who refuse using a hearing aid. In other words, many people beyond the typical clinical population could potentially benefit from hearing support technologies if they were integrated in application-specific, non-medical devices. Examples include telephone speech in enviroments with ambient noise or distracting colleagues (like callcenters), too ambitionsly mixed TV dialog, or hearing protection devices preventing users from communicating with their peers. When attempting to introduce hearing support in non-medical applications, one specific challenge is to account for individual factors, which are normally dealt with by the professional acoustician during the fine tuning of medical hearing devices.This is especially complex because effective hearing support algorithms require tuning a large number of parameters and behave in a nonlinear and signal-adaptive way. This complexity is beyond the general understanding of non-expert user. This contribution presents recent research and development of personalized sound processing schemes, which can be fully selfadministered and aim at providing the best trade-off between effective hearing support and man-machine interaction complexity by making use of innovative user interfaces and algorithmic concepts. To assess the benefit of such solutions, novel evaluation concepts are required because the typical audiological approach of measuring speech intelligibility is not applicable to close-to-normal-hearing listeners in ecologically valid listening scenarios. This contribution therefore also discusses alternative behavioural hearing assessment methods as well as neurophysiological approaches, in particular electroencephalography.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Auditory impairments, particularly those resulting from hazardous occupational noise exposures, are pressing concerns for the US Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA). However, to date, no studies have estimated the rate of hearing threshold change that occurs during service or how changes may vary by military occupation. Hearing threshold changes during military service have historically been reported as the proportion of Service members demonstrating a significant threshold shift. This approach does not capture the rate of the hearing threshold change or the specific audiometric frequencies impacted. Determining the rate of hearing threshold change, and factors that affect the rate of change, is important to elucidate the impact of military service on hearing and to guide prevention strategies and subsequent hearing health care. Our primary objective was to estimate the annual rate of hearing threshold change during military service as a consequence of military occupational noise exposure ranking. DESIGN: We linked audiometric data, collected from military personnel as part of a DoD hearing conservation program, to data describing demographic and military-service characteristics obtained from individuals enrolled in the Noise Outcomes In Service members Epidemiology Study. The analytic cohort included Veterans who enlisted in military service after September 2001 (n = 246). We examined the longitudinal association between military occupations categorized as having a low, moderate, or high noise exposure ranking and pure-tone hearing thresholds (500 to 6000 Hz) using a hierarchical linear model. The average annual rate of hearing threshold change and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated by service branch, military occupational noise exposure ranking, and audiometric test frequency. RESULT(S): On average, hearing threshold change ranged between -0.5 and 1.1 dB/year and changes over time varied by service branch, audiometric test frequency, and military occupation noise ranking. Generally, higher test frequencies (3000 to 6000 Hz) and military occupations with moderate or high noise exposure rankings had the greatest average annual rates of hearing threshold change; however, no dose-response relationship was observed. Among Marine Corps personnel, those exposed to occupations with high noise rankings demonstrated the greatest average annual rate of change (1.1 dB/year at 6000 Hz). Army personnel exposed to occupations with moderate noise rankings demonstrated the greatest average annual rate of change (0.6 dB/year at 6000 Hz). CONCLUSION(S): This study (1) demonstrates the unique use of DoD hearing conservation program data, (2) is the first analysis of hearing threshold changes over time using such data, and (3) adds to the limited literature on longitudinal changes in hearing. The difference in hearing threshold changes across military branches is likely indicative of their varying noise exposures, hearing protection device use and enforcement, and surveillance practices. Results suggest Marine Corps and Army personnel are at risk for hearing threshold changes and that, among Army personnel, this is most pronounced among those exposed to moderate levels of occupational noise exposure. Estimates of the rate of hearing threshold change by frequency and factors that impact hearing are useful to inform the DoD's efforts to protect the hearing of their Service members and to the Veterans Affairs's efforts to identify and rehabilitate those most likely to experience hearing threshold change.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This investigation was designed to determine the effectiveness of earmuffs worn by a single individual during shooting practice. DESIGN: Single subject experimental design. STUDY SAMPLE: A 21-year old female recreational shooter, who practiced shooting on a regular basis while using earmuffs participated in the study. She reported occasional noise exposures of other types including car races and demolition derbies but no hearing difficulties or symptoms such as tinnitus. Her auditory sensitivity was within normal limits. On each test-day, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were recorded in a sound-attenuated booth before and after a shooting practice session conducted while using earmuffs. Data were collected across six different days, across six weeks, to allow recovery from each of the six shooting practice sessions. The participant was requested to refrain from other noisy activities in between sessions. RESULT(S): Significant changes in DPOAE signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were apparent following the shooting sessions, at 1184 and 4761Hz in the left ear suggesting that the hearing protection worn by the individual was insufficient to completely protect her hearing. CONCLUSION(S): It is possible to assess the effectiveness of hearing protection worn by individual shooters using repeated measurements of DPOAEs embedded in a single case-research design.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health professionals working in the dental environment are potentially at risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to the use of clinical and laboratory equipment. Workplaces engaging in the practice of dentistry within the UK are subject to legislation from the Control of Noise at Work (CNW) regulations 2005. Clinicians working in the military are at further increased risk of NIHL due to exposure from additional risk factors such as rifles or aircraft engines. To our knowledge, no authors have previously studied the noise levels experienced in a military dental setting or compared noise levels in a typical dental practice with current UK legislation. METHOD(S): Measurements of noise levels experienced by a dentist, dental nurse and dental hygienist during a standard conservation procedure were assessed using wearable noise dose-badges. Furthermore, noise levels within a dental technician's work space were also assessed. Noise levels produced by representative clinical and laboratory equipment were assessed and compared with CNW legislation. RESULT(S): The highest level for clinical equipment was produced by the suction apparatus while aspirating up a cup of water at 76dB. For laboratory equipment, the lower exposure action value (LEAV) of 80dB would be exceeded in 2.1hours' use of the trimmer, 3.6hours' use of the vibrating table and 9 min use of the airline. CONCLUSION(S): Noise levels experienced by clinicians within the dental surgery were well below the legislative LEAV thresholds for both peak and continuous noise. However, noise levels produced by laboratory equipment were far higher and there is clearly the potential for excessive noise exposure for dental professional in the everyday setting. Dental professionals responsible for dental laboratory settings must be familiar with the CNW regulations and measures put in place that control the inadvertent breach of legislation. Hearing protection must be mandated when using equipment that exceeds the LEAV and an educational programme is required to explain both their correct use and the rationale behind it. Methods of mitigating that risk further require exploration such as alternative methods of completing the tasks performed by the airline or reducing the noise generated by it, such as by reducing the supply pressure or using an alternative nozzle design.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

AB  - Introduction: Sudden deafness is abrupt hearing loss, usually unilateral, with no well-defined etiological factor. The differential diagnosis includes some others diseases, such as infectious, hematological, neurological and most likely, the vestibular schawnnoma. Objective(s): To report the therapeutic difficulties through a case of sudden deafness associated with dizziness and tinnitus. Resumed report: Patient 36 years old, 70 kg, male, musician. Admitted to an otorhinolaryngological unit complaining that 4 days after a concert woke up with accusation in the left ear, accompanied by rotatory dizziness worse to the movement of the head to the left, besides episodes of nausea and vomiting and non-pulsatile tinnitus in the left ear of the whistle type. Otoscopy and radiological exams without alterations, thus excluding the main differential diagnoses. Patient was hospitalized for initiation of drug therapy and audiometric screening. He has been using Ceftriaxone, Valacyclovir, Pentoxifylline, Ginkgo Biloba Extract and symptomatic remedies. Fifteen days after hospitalization there was a slight improvement in the audiometric standard and the clinical picture. Patient was discharged through a new evaluation of otolaryngology and phonoaudiology. There was a need to use a hearing aid for unilateral deafness and earplugs for work activities. Patient was followed up in an outpatient setting, with no further changes. Conclusion(s): The uncertainty of the etiopathogenesis and the great controversy over the treatment of the affected patients represent the difficult decision making through sudden deafness. Therefore, it is essential to stimulate further research in this area. deafness.

AB  - Noise-induced auditory symptom (NIAS) refers to symptoms that develop after an exposure to loud noise, where common symptoms are tinnitus and hearing difficulty. If not detected early or prevented, NIAS may lead to the development of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). This is a cross-sectional study that aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of common NIAS and contributing occupational factors among manufacturing workers in Brunei Darussalam. The response rate for this study was 81.7%. The prevalence rate of NIAS was 18% and the most commonly-reported symptom was "ears feeling full after leaving a very noisy place" (10.5%). This study showed a strong association between absence of HPD (Hearing Protective Device) use (aOR= 2.118, P = 0.040) with having at-least one reported NIAS. The study findings can be used to plan, implement and evaluate policies where there is risk of occupational noise exposure to prevent NIAS and further development of NIHL.

AB  - Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) is the most reported occupational disease in Malaysia. ONIHL is aggravated by the presence of early hearing loss amongst the youth prior to entering a real working environment. At technical and vocational education training (TVET) institutions, students may develop early ONIHL because training workshops are designed imitating the industrial working environment to produce skilled workers. The exceeding noise level at workshops and recent risk of non-occupational noise can cause early ONIHL among these students. Therefore, ONIHL must be addressed at the early stage of producing skilled workers. Octa hearing conservation index (OHCI) system is developed as a management and monitoring tool for hearing conservation program (HCP) in TVET institutions. Six existing and two new HCP components were used to build the index system. A pilot test on the effectiveness of the OHCI system was conducted in a selected TVET institution for six months. The post-HCP shows a 52.6% improvement compared to the pre-HCP. The implementation of HCP has shown improved awareness on the hazards of loud noise exposure and active use of hearing protection devices among participants. The OHCI system has a great potential as a tool to improve HCP implementation in TVET institutions, and eventually, industry.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background An understanding of occupational characteristics of a worker is essential to establish policies, legislation in order to protect the health of the worker. The concept of Occupational Safety and Health is in initial stage in our country. Work-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is caused by occupational factors that increase the oxygen requirements of the heart or decrease the capacity of the heart to use oxygen. It can be very difficult to link a specific work-related exposure to the development of cardiovascular disease in an individual person. This is because of issues of latency, multiple possible risk factors, lack of specific work-related features and various factors that influence diagnosis. Objective To study occupational characteristics and their association with cardiovascular disease among relatively young male industrial workers between 20-59 years of age in Sunsari-Morang industrial corridor of Eastern Nepal. Method A cross sectional study was conducted among men between 20 -59 years of age in two randomly selected industries in the Sunsari-Morang corridor of Eastern Nepal from July 2012 to July 2013. The data was collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Systematic random sampling was done to select the required number of samples. Chi-square and Fisher Exact tests were used. Crude and adjusted analyses were done. Result Majority (85%) were day shift workers. About 40% of the workers worked for 70-80hrs/ week. Most of them have stress sometimes at work. Noise was experienced by 40.9% of the workers. Earplug was used by only 5% of the workers. Hypertriglyceridaemia was seen in 49.3% of the workers. Long working hours, not using earplug and financial stress were seen to be associated with cardiovascular disease on bi-variate analysis. However, only earplug was significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusion Risk of cardiovascular disease was seen more among those who worked for more hours; those who did not use earplug and those who had financial stress. The results need further exploration to establish a causal association between occupational characteristics of the workers and cardiovascular disease in industrial set-up of eastern Nepal.Copyright © 2018, Kathmandu University.

AB  - Introduction: Hypersensitivity to sound and tinnitus are often co-morbid and can influence emotional well-being, hearing, sleep, concentration, cause anxiety, and interfere with speech perception in noise. Purpose(s): A clear measure of sensitivity to sound is important as there is dearth in standard protocol for evaluating hyperacusis in individuals with tinnitus. Although there are a few questionnaires to assess hyperacusis, a direct application of these questionnaires in the Indian context would be unfavorable. Objective(s): The study attempts to develop and validate an indigenous Hyperacusis Handicap Questionnaire (HHQ) for individuals with tinnitus associated with hyperacusis. Method(s): A total of 25 questions were considered for validation. Further, 21 questions were subdivided into three sections of seven questions each, tapping, 'Functional,' 'Social,' and 'Emotional' aspects of the condition. It was administered on 77 individuals with tinnitus associated with hyperacusis in the age range of 20-55 years for further validation. A total score was obtained by adding all the three sub-scales. Result(s): The internal consistency of the questionnaire was determined by Cronbach's Alpha (alpha) was alpha = 0.85; and, alpha = 0.83 for Functional, alpha = 0.81 for Social, alpha = 0.7 for Emotional subscales suggesting that the questionnaire can be used for the assessment of handicap associated with hyperacusis in individuals with tinnitus. Also, no significant difference in terms of gender and duration of tinnitus comparisons were seen. Conclusion(s): The obtained results suggest that HHQ will aid in the characterization and quantification of the handicap associated with hyperacusis in individuals with tinnitus.Copyright © 2019 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uniform attenuation earplugs (UAE) theoretically provide near even attenuation across frequencies when built to a manufacturer's specifications. Unfortunately, there is no current research available confirming if custom-molded uniform attenuation earplugs (UAE) are made to specifications nor is there guidance available on clinical methods of measuring attenuation of uniform attenuation earplug (UAE) devices. The goal of this study was to evaluate different procedures for UAE verification and to determine the most accurate clinically accessible verification protocol. DESIGN: Attenuation was measured using probe microphone techniques, as well as real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements under circumaural earphones, soundfield speakers and supra-aural earphones. Comparisons were made to a reference system created in the laboratory. STUDY SAMPLE: Seventeen adult participants, totaling 30 ears. RESULT(S): The results of this study demonstrate that the REAT measured in the soundfield using a narrowband noise stimulus with masking in the contralateral ear is currently the most accurate and widely available method of verifying UAEs. CONCLUSION(S): Factoring in clinical efficiency, the authors of this study recommend verifying attenuation levels using a soundfield REAT procedure as best clinical practice. In addition, the data suggests that REAT measurements under circumaural earphones are an acceptable second choice method.

AB  - Background Industry's noise has long been an issue that cannot be resolved properly so it can be a serious threat to the workers's hearing function. In Indonesia, the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss is estimated between 20%-30% of the total working population in the formal sector who are productive, while the incidence of hearing loss due to noise in the informal sector is not yet known. Objective This study aims to determine the relation of noise and other risk factors for hearing loss on carpenters of informal sector in Duren Sawit district, East Jakarta in 2013. Method This study was an observational analytic with a cross sectional method. This research was carried out on 71 woodworkers in Duren Sawit districts, East Jakarta. Data were obtained from observations, additional physical examination, and an interview based on a questionnaire that has been made. Analysed using univariate and bivariate analysis. Results A total of 51 workers (71.8%) had subjective hearing loss. All workers have the perception that their workplace is quite noisy. In bivariate analysis, the use of Hearing Protection Devices has a significant effect on the occurrence of hearing loss, with a value of p=0.032, OR=8.824. Conclusion Noise has a considerable impact on the occurrence of hearing loss. In addition, workers who did not use Hearing Protection Devices have 8 times greater risk for hearing loss compared with workers who use Hearing Protection Devices.

AB  - A study of initial and repeat audiograms of 118 drop forge employees using fixed frequency selfrecording audiometry showed that the mean of the differences at the test frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 KHz ranges from -0.47 dB to +0.61 dB. The largest standard deviation was 6 dB at 6 kHz and the lowest 3 dB at 2 kHz. The results also confirmed that temporary threshold shift effects may be minimized if audiograms are obtained at the beginning of a shift or within 2 hr provided the subject is protected with ear muff defenders up to the time of the test. The practical advantages to industry of using self recording audiometry for audiometric screening and the reliability of single audiograms for threshold determination are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the ability of single-sided deaf listeners implanted with a cochlear implant (SSD-CI) to (1) determine the front-back and left-right location of sound sources presented from loudspeakers surrounding the listener and (2) use small head rotations to further improve their localization performance. The resulting behavioral data were used for further analyses investigating the value of so-called "monaural" spectral shape cues for front-back sound source localization. DESIGN: Eight SSD-CI patients were tested with their cochlear implant (CI) on and off. Eight normal-hearing (NH) listeners, with one ear plugged during the experiment, and another group of eight NH listeners, with neither ear plugged, were also tested. Gaussian noises of 3-sec duration were band-pass filtered to 2-8kHz and presented from 1 of 6 loudspeakers surrounding the listener, spaced 60degree apart. Perceived sound source localization was tested under conditions where the patients faced forward with the head stationary, and under conditions where they rotated their heads between (Equation is included in full-text article.). RESULT(S): (1) Under stationary listener conditions, unilaterally-plugged NH listeners and SSD-CI listeners (with their CIs both on and off) were nearly at chance in determining the front-back location of high-frequency sound sources. (2) Allowing rotational head movements improved performance in both the front-back and left-right dimensions for all listeners. (3) For SSD-CI patients with their CI turned off, head rotations substantially reduced front-back reversals, and the combination of turning on the CI with head rotations led to near-perfect resolution of front-back sound source location. (4) Turning on the CI also improved left-right localization performance. (5) As expected, NH listeners with both ears unplugged localized to the correct front-back and left-right hemifields both with and without head movements. CONCLUSION(S): Although SSD-CI listeners demonstrate a relatively poor ability to distinguish the front-back location of sound sources when their head is stationary, their performance is substantially improved with head movements. Most of this improvement occurs when the CI is off, suggesting that the NH ear does most of the "work" in this regard, though some additional gain is introduced with turning the CI on. During head turns, these listeners appear to primarily rely on comparing changes in head position to changes in monaural level cues produced by the direction-dependent attenuation of high-frequency sounds that result from acoustic head shadowing. In this way, SSD-CI listeners overcome limitations to the reliability of monaural spectral and level cues under stationary conditions. SSD-CI listeners may have learned, through chronic monaural experience before CI implantation, or with the relatively impoverished spatial cues provided by their CI-implanted ear, to exploit the monaural level cue. Unilaterally-plugged NH listeners were also able to use this cue during the experiment to realize approximately the same magnitude of benefit from head turns just minutes after plugging, though their performance was less accurate than that of the SSD-CI listeners, both with and without their CI turned on.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Noise exposure has long been an occupational health concern and has been an important area of focus of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) since its founding. Nevertheless, it remains unclear what effects OSHA's noise standards have had on employer efforts to reduce risks. Consequently, a review of OSHA noise standard violations was performed to clarify the violation trends between 1972 and 2019. METHOD(S): Using the OSHA Information System, researchers identified 119305 violations involving four noise standards between 1972 and 2019: 29 CFR 1910.95, occupational noise exposure in general industry; 1926.52, occupational noise exposure in construction; 1926.101, hearing protection in construction, and 1904.10, recording criteria for cases involving occupational hearing loss. Violation frequencies of noise standard subparagraphs and relationships to factors such as industry differences were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t tests. RESULT(S): The most commonly violated noise standard was 1910.95 in manufacturing. Such violations rose between 1972 and 1985 and then declined steadily. Whether in general industry or construction, four noise standards were most-frequently cited: lack of feasible administrative or engineering controls (1910.95[b] and 1926.52[d]) and inadequate hearing conservation program (1910.95[c] and 1926.52[b]). These violations were more highly penalized (mean=$1036.50) than other subparagraph violations (mean=$915.80). Programmed and unprogrammed inspections generated similar violation quantities except between 1980 and 1985, when programmed inspections exhibited a sharp spike in violations. CONCLUSION(S): The study identified trends in OSHA noise standard violations and possible explanations for those trends. The study findings can support development of more practical noise-exposure protection policy.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: MRI acoustic noise represents hazard to patients undergoing MRI and to staff present in the scanner room. The FDA considers A-weighted rootmean- square sound pressure level greater than 99 dBA in MRI to be of significant risk needing hearing protection. The goal of this study was to perform inter-vendor acoustic noise comparison on identical field strengths and bore sizes to evaluate appropriate baseline hearing protection requirements. Method(s): Acoustic noise measurements were performed on Siemens Skyra and GE 750w, both 3.0T wide-bore MRI scanners using an acoustic meter (3M Sound Examiner, Model SE-402). The measurements were made at three locations: 1) center of the scanner bore, 2) entrance of the bore and 3) at 200 G line (~ 1 meter from the bore entrance). Per IEC-601-2-33 recommendations, the sequences were run for at least 1 min and A-weighted sound pressure levels were measured to obtain dBA readings. Result(s): At the center of the bore, EPI and HASTE sequences recorded the highest noise values for Siemens Skyra, reaching 108.2 dBA and 107.2 dBA peak, respectively, and AX T2 FRFSE and CUBE T1 FSE sequences were the loudest for GE 750w, both reaching 145 dBA peak. All sequences measured between 100-110 dbA peak at the entrance of the bore and at 200 Gauss line on both the GE and Siemens scanner. Conclusion(s): MRI scanners produce noise levels that can exceed FDA significant risk threshold for both patients and staff. Sequences requiring high gradient performance and fast switching, e.g. EPI or TSE, produce the loudest noise levels. Acoustic noise peak for GE 750w was significantly higher (~30 dBA) at the center of the bore than Siemens. It is recommended that a facility with multiple vendor MRI scanners to measure acoustic noise levels on all vendors to determine adequate baseline hearing protection.

AB  - Noise may cause stress responses such as apnea, hypoxemia, changes in oxygen satura-tion and augmented oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates. Moreo-ver, stress results in increased intracranial pressure, abnormal sleep patterns, hearing impairment, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, periven-tricular leukomalacia, retardate development and alterations in the neuroendocrine system. Herein, this study aimed to discuss the effects of earmuffs on physiological parameters in preterm infants. The relevant and available peer-reviewed publications from 2012 to 2018 from various databases were analyzed. For the assessment of the studies, the full-text accessible studies were included for analysis. The retrieved documents were analyzed using VOSviewer regarding the geographical dis-tributions of the documents with their numbers and citations, keywords proposed by the research-ers. All records with the term "earmuffs OR earmuff" in the "article title, abstract, keywords" were retrieved from different databases. Accordingly, 396 documents containing the word "earmuffs OR earmuff" were recorded. The search was then restricted for publications that contain the words "noise AND nursing AND preterm" in the title and abstracts (TITLE-ABS-KEY (earmuffs OR ear-muff)) AND (noise AND nursing AND preterm) (Scopus=390; Web of Science=1, Medline=2; Cochrane=1; Embase=1= Pubmed=1=n=396). After inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 documents were recorded and then evaluated for the present study. As a conclusion, the effects of earmuffs on physiological parameters of preterm infants have not been clearly understood and reported yet. Along with the present documents, it is not clear that the use of earmuffs reduces stress and provides physiological stability in preterm infants born between approximately 28-32 weeks. The studies with a larger sample size are needed for validation of information reported in the articles analyzed herein.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Patients sleep poorly in ICU owing to multiple factors, including excessive noise. Many sources of disturbance, such as alarms and communication between staff, cannot be modified. Earplugs have been trialled and may offer some benefit; however, newer technologies such as active noise cancelling headphones with white noise masking (ANCH) have never been trialled in critical care patients. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of ANCH on the sleep of critical care patients, whilst assessing tolerability of equipment, and reliability of actigraphy bands. All critical care patients on the general ICU and HDU were screened daily for eligibility. Patients were excluded if they were receiving invasive or noninvasive ventilation, were delirious, were an infection risk, were expected to be discharged before study completion, did not have capacity to give consent, or refused consent. Patients were enrolled for two nights, spending one night wearing the headphones (intervention night), and one night receiving standard care (control night). Patients were randomised into group A or B, which determined the order of intervention night vs control night, to control for confounders. Primary outcome was the change in perceived sleep quality, measured by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, which is validated for use in ICU patients. Other data was collected using an actigraphy band (Xiaomi MiBand 2) worn by each participant, and a researcher composed a questionnaire capturing patient experience. Fourteen critical care patients in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh completed this randomised crossover trial within the first 5 weeks of recruitment. The mean difference in RCSQ score between intervention and control night was 5.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], -14.9-26.3). Although the mean difference suggested improved sleep, this finding was not statistically significant, with CIs overlapping 0, and P-value of 0.55. Data from the actigraphy bands was unreliable and often failed to collect any data. Overall, 76% of participants reported that caregiving activities disturbed their sleep, whereas as only 21% of participants reported that noise disturbed sleep. Active noise cancelling headphones with white noise masking did not improve all patients' sleep in critical care. Adequate noise attenuation may not be enough to improve sleep if other factors, such as pain and caregiving activities, are more disruptive. However some patients may benefit from this simple intervention.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Hearing impairment caused by noise, traditionally called - depending on the duration of exposure - acute or chronic acoustic trauma, includes, in addition to presbyacusis, the most common adult population of hearing impaired. In Poland - according to the report of the Central Statistical Office (GUS, 2011), the number of workers employed in NDN exceeded the noise level (85 dB) is about 200 thousand, the highest in the mining, metal and metal products production, textiles and wood production. According to the Regulation of the Council of Ministers of on June 30, 2009, on the list of occupational diseases (Journal of Laws No. 132, item 1115), it is defined as "bilateral permanent hearing loss of the cochlear or sensory-nerve type, expressed as an increase in hearing threshold of at least 45 dB in the ear better heard, calculated as an arithmetic mean for frequencies 1,2 and 3 kHz. Hearing impairments also occur in the military and police during field training and in combat where the source of acoustic injuries are firearms and pulse-inducing explosions (as in some industries) with high C peak levels (Lc peak) Time to rise to a maximum of <1 ms. The prevalence of loud music listening, particularly by personal stereo players, is also affecting children and adolescents with audiometric hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of around 15-20%. The preventive action strategy is defined by the European Union legislation and the national implementing legislation that reduces or eliminates the risk and reduces (if not eliminated), taking into account available technical and organizational solutions to minimize the risk of hearing damage. If you can not reduce the noise levels with technical and organizational methods, you need individual hearing protectors. Ear protectors may be equipped with electronic systems with active noise reduction (which can improve low and medium frequency performance), adjustable attenuation (improves speech intelligibility and perception of warning signals), and wireless communication for verbal communication.Copyright © 2017 Polish Society of Otorhinolaryngologists Head and Neck Surgeons.

AB  - Context: Hearing loss (HL) is a major health concern among military personnel due to noise from shooting, blasts, military vehicles, and noisy training environments. Nevertheless, one's exposure can be partially reduced by using personal protective equipment (PPE). The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of HL among military personnel, to analyse associations between HL and self-reported occupational and leisure noise exposure, and use of PPEs. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 military personnel during their routine medical examinations. First, all participants filled in a questionnaire about their exposure to noise and later the respondents went through an audiometric test. The diagnostic criteria for slight, moderate, and severe HL was HL of 25-40, 41-60, and >60dB at 4 and 6kHz, respectively. The associations between noise exposure and HL were studied with multinomial logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The prevalence of slight to severe HL in high frequencies (4 and 6kHz) among study participants was 62.7%. Nevertheless, the majority of it was slight, as the prevalence of severe HL was 9.3%. The prevalence of any kind of HL was highest in the Navy and the prevalence of severe HL was highest in the Central Command Units. The relative risk ratios (RRRs) for HL were higher among those who had been working for a long time in a noisy environment, working with noise-producing equipment, driving in a PASI or a Bandvagn or had been shooting with blanks at least once per week. It also appeared that military personnel who had HL, reported tinnitus more often. Respondents' previous health problems, music-listening habits, and amount of exposure to loud noise in non-military environments were not independently associated with HL, but in several cases it increased the RRRs together with military exposure. We also found significantly more frequent HL among those never using PPEs. Conclusion(s): HL loss was more prevalent among personnel who are more often exposed to military noise, especially among those who never use PPEs. The effect was enhanced by leisure time noise, but it was not independently associated to HL.

AB  - Purpose/Background: Hospitalization may severely disrupt sleep, which can worsen pain and the physiological and psychiatric health of acutely ill patients. Multiple factors lead to sleep disturbances in hospitalized surgical patients. Our aim was to measure the quality and perception of sleep on a single surgical ward, and then evaluate the efficacy of a dedicated "sleep bundle" on improving the patients' experiences and sleep. Methods/Interventions: We surveyed postoperative colorectal surgery patients at a single institution at the conclusion of their hospitalization. The St. Mary's Hospital and Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaires were used to assess sleep before and after the intervention. During institution of the bundle we surveyed patients on an adjacent surgical ward that did not use the bundle and hence served as a control. The sleep bundle was instituted on the evening of postoperative day #1 among consecutive patients. It consisted of dayshift nurse education, a sleep package offered to all patients (sleep mask, sound machine, and ear plugs), medication for sleep (melatonin or diphenhydramine), checking telemetry batteries, ensuring sufficient intravenous fluids to last the night, providing pain medication, bathroom use prior to sleep, and closing but not latching the room door. Results/Outcome(s): Of the pre-intervention cohort (n=51), most (76.5%) reported sleeping at least fairly well during their hospitalization and 62.7% were fairly to completely satisfied with their sleep (table 1). This was similar to the post-intervention cohort (n=26). Implementation of the sleep bundle resulted in a non-significant improvement in the domain of wakefulness after sleep (6.2 vs 5.3, p=0.11), but not in the getting to sleep (4.6 vs 4.9, p=0.65) or quality of sleep (4.7 vs. 4.1, p=0.32) domains. Patients reported similar times being awoken in both cohorts (4.6 vs. 4.9, p=0.52) and overall there was no difference in satisfaction related to sleep while in the hospital (3.5 of 5 for both groups, p=0.87). Conclusions/Discussion: The implementation of a simple bundle focused on minimizing overnight interruptions failed to significantly impact sleep quality and satisfaction on a dedicated colorectal surgery unit. These data suggest that the patient's overall medical condition and not the interruptions of staff may be the main contributor to the quality of postoperative sleep.

AB  - We assessed Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) regarding occupational noise exposure, Noise-induced hearing loss, audiometry and use of hearing protection devices among iron and steel factory workers exposed to high noise level. A modified, validated, structured questionnaire was used to collect information from 253 male workers randomly selected from the four factories. The sum scores for each domain of KAP were computed. Scores above 75% were defined as good knowledge and positive attitude. For practice, scores of >50% were defined as good. Independent samples t-test and Chi-squared test were used to analyze association between KAP and continuous/categorical variables respectively. Majority of workers displayed poor knowledge and poor practice (94%), but 76% displayed a positive attitude. Most of the workers (86%) had never been provided with hearing protection devices. The mean scores for attitude and practice differed significantly between the four factories (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Implementation of hearing conservation program with provision of hearing protection devices are suggested.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Occupational activities performed by sound engineers are associated with hearing loss. However, there is a dearth of research on the hearing functions and the related hearing loss for sound engineers. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the hearing function and early effects of noise on the hearing ability of sound engineers, and to establish whether there are hearing conservation programmes (HCPs) available for sound engineer participants in Johannesburg. METHOD(S): A quantitative cross-sectional design was used. Eight sound engineers from the Academy of Sound Engineering (ASE) participated in the study. The following data were collected from the participants: case history data, ear-related symptoms and hearing conservation data. Hearing screening followed by full diagnostic audiological assessments was conducted for each participant. Descriptive statistics and one-sample t-test were used to analyse the data (confidence interval [CI] = 95%). RESULT(S): Participants reported tinnitus and aural fullness as common complaints. Only one participant had a unilateral impacted cerumen. All the participants presented with hearing within normal limits bilaterally, with a percentage loss of hearing (PLH) of 1.1% for all the participants. However, five participants presented with a notched configuration that was >= 10 decibel (dB), in the high frequency region at 3000 Hz and 6000 Hz bilaterally. One-sample t-test (p = 0.001) inferred that at a mean age of 27.6 years (standard deviation [SD] = 3.85), a notch at 3000 Hz and 6000 Hz was associated with an early sign of a hearing loss for the study participants. An HCP was not in place at the study site. CONCLUSION(S): The study indicated a younger age as an associated early sign of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) for the study participants, and that audiologists' clinical practice needs to explore HCP strategies specific for the sound engineers in order to prevent hearing loss.

AB  - Aims and method Sleep disturbance is common in psychiatry wards despite poor sleep worsening mental health. Contributory factors include the ward environment, frequent nightly checks on patients and sleep disorders including sleep apnoea. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of a package of measures to improve sleep across a mental health trust, including removing hourly checks when safe, sleep disorder screening and improving the ward environment. Results During the pilot there were no serious adverse events; 50% of in-patients were able to have protected overnight sleep. Hypnotic issuing decreased, and feedback from patients and staff was positive. It was possible to offer cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia to selected patients. Clinical implications Many psychiatry wards perform standardised, overnight checks, which are one cause of sleep disruption. A protected sleep period was safe and well-tolerated alongside education about sleep disturbance and mental health. Future research should evaluate personalised care rather than blanket observation policies.Copyright © The Authors 2020.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Disturbed sleep and sleep deprivation are common complaints among inpatients; however, limited research has targeted this population to investigate primary causes and solutions, and no comprehensive guidelines address this widespread problem. Recent Findings: Many factors contribute to inpatient sleep difficulty. Key environmental sources are excess noise and light. The use of earplugs and eye masks are supported by some studies. Attempts to reduce disturbing light and noise on hospital units have been helpful. Schedule modifications that limit awakenings for measurements and medications also have been shown to be beneficial. Patients with inpatient sleep complaints are prescribed a wide range of medications, though little guidance is available to direct therapy with regard to pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features, adverse event risks, and potential interactions. Summary: A combination of environmental modifications and altered schedules for routine assessments, procedures, and treatments; individualized non-pharmacological interventions; and strategically chosen medications for selected patients should help minimize nighttime sleep disruption in hospitalized patients.Copyright © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: Musicians are known to be at risk for developing hearing sensitivity and hearing-related problems given their occupational exposure to high-level sound. Among options for hearing conservation, earplugs are an effective and inexpensive choice. Adoption rates for musicians' earplugs remains consistently low, however, given concerns about the impact of hearing protection on their own performance as well as concerns that the resultant music will be a negative experience for listeners. In fact, few studies have (1) examined musicians' attitudes about using hearing protection while performing themselves and (2) determined whether music played by musicians wearing hearing protection sounds different to listeners. Purpose(s): The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate how wearing musicians' earplugs affected musicians' perception of their performance while they were playing, and (2) to examine whether listeners can distinguish a difference between music recorded by musicians playing with and without earplugs. Research Design: Experiment 1: student musicians were recorded playing under two conditions (with and without wearing earplugs) and then were surveyed about their experience. Experiment 2: musically experienced and naive listeners were presented with musical samples played by musicians with and without earplugs in an ABX format. Listeners responded by indicating whether the third stimulus (X) was conditionally identical to the first (A) or second stimulus (B). Result(s): Experiment 1: while performing, musicians always preferred the no earplugs condition. The majority, however, rated the overall experience of playing with earplugs as generally positive. Experiment 2: listeners were unable to hear a difference between the two recordings. Discussion(s): In this experiment, musicians rated their experience playing without hearing protection more favorably than their experience playing with hearing protection, but most musicians rated their experience with hearing protection as generally positive. The inability of listeners to distinguish a difference in music played with and without hearing protection suggests that the listening experience may not be adversely impacted by hearing protection worn by the performers. Conclusion(s): Earplugs are an inexpensive, noninvasive strategy for hearing conservation for musicians, and this study indicates that barriers to wearing hearing protection might be less problematic than previously reported.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Audiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major contributor to disabling hearing loss. Engineering controls are superior to hearing protection devices (HPDs) in prevention of occupational noise induced hearing loss (ONIHL), although the latter are more commonly used. Effective use of audiometry requires quick categorization of audiograms. The UK Health and Safety Executive (UKHSE) scheme for the categorization of audiograms is a tool that accomplishes this. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the classification of audiograms and build a case for the preferential use of the UKHSE's scheme to achieve this. METHOD(S): The author provides a literature review of methods of classification for audiograms and uses a case study in a Tanzanian mining company to demonstrate how the UKHSE scheme was successfully used to enhance the existing hearing protection program. RESULT(S): The literature review identified several methods of classification based on a variation of threshold shifts from baseline. The difference was in the frequency and level of threshold shift used to determine hearing loss, and the recommended course of action once hearing loss is detected. The UKHSE scheme is simple and provides guidance on steps to be taken thereafter. This was demonstrated in a case study among miners in a mining company in Tanzania. CONCLUSION(S): The UKHSE audiogram classification scheme has the advantage of providing a straightforward, easy to determine classification that allows for intervention appropriate to the findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This article presents the details and findings of a practical implementation of a preliminary model for use in hearing conservation programmes (HCPs) in the mining sector in South Africa. OBJECTIVE(S): The implementation is based on a previously published model, called feedback-based noise monitoring model (FBNMM), and represents its implementation as a tool of predicting occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL), as well as monitoring and managing HCPs in the mining sector within the South African context. METHOD(S): The article, utilising real miners' data, demonstrates this basic static feedback model with its practical applications such as estimating, monitoring and providing quantitative information to aid miners, mining administrators and policymakers in decision-making around HCPs, as recommended in the previous 2019 publication by Moroe et al. This study was conducted in a South African platinum mine. Evidence on the model's sensitivity and practicability in early identification, intervention and management of ONIHL in the workplace is presented. RESULT(S): Findings show how the use of the model within an HCP viewed as a complex intervention can allow for early prediction of ONIHL, consequently affording more accurate early intervention as part of preventive audiology within the health and safety goals of mines. CONCLUSION(S): The feedback-based model should be a useful tool for successful implementation and monitoring of HCPs within South African mines.

AB  - All of us are recipients of health care, and most of the ICOH Congress participants also provide health services. As patients and providers we expect that the service being rendered stands on a solid scientific base. Nowadays, with the expansion of publications and communication channels, we hear a lot about evidence-based practice (EBP) and systematic reviews. Systematic reviews, are the most important type of scientific review because they are central to evidence-based practice, but they can be misunderstood or even intimidating to some. Examination of the contributions of systematic reviews to occupational health and the processes to get familiarised, became a user and participate in the implementation of evidence-based practices to prevent work-related disorders. Locating pertinent Cochrane resources and reviews, and defining what are answerable questions and eligible sources of evidence for a Cochrane Review. Examples will focus on a Cochrane review that examined the effectiveness of enforcement tools for preventing occupational diseases and injuries and a second one that examined interventions to promote the use of hearing protections and other efforts to control noise and promote hearing loss prevention. To be able to offer evidence- based practices, occupational health professional need to recognise the need and approaches that will allow him/her to be a lifelong learner, by keeping current with evidence-based professional practice, and engage in continuing competence and professional development activities.

AB  - Fluctuations in which spectral density are inversely proportional to frequency are called l/f fluctuations. This type of fluctuation has been found in a variety of phenomena. The l/f fluctuations are presumed to be comfortable because music and other comfortable phenomena have this type of fluctuation. The purpose of this study is to examine the comfortableness of the fluctuating air flow of an air-conditioner which fan speed was controlled by the l/f l/f fluctiation. 157 subjects (75 males and 82 females) participated in this experiment and half of them wore ear plugs to investigate the effect of the fan noise. Two types of fluctuating air flow of an air-conditioner (wide range fluctuation and narrow range fluctuation) and laminar air flow were evaluated by the rank order test, the open-ended method and the semantic differential method. Our results indicated that wide range fluctuating air flow was most uncomfortable because of its fluctuating fan noise. The comfortableness of the narrow range fluctuating air flow and the constant one are almost equal. Moreover, factors which affect the subjective comfortableness are discussed

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep disruption caused by a variety of conditions, such as staff activities, alarms on monitors, and overall noise. In this study, we explored the relationship between noise and other factors associated with poor sleep quality in patients. METHOD(S): This was a prospective cohort study. We used the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire to explore sleep quality in a sample of patients admitted to the ICU of a private hospital. We measured the noise levels within each ICU three times a day. After each night during their ICU stay, patients were asked to complete a survey about sleep disturbances. These disturbances were classified as biological (such as anxiety or pain) and environmental factors (such as lighting and ICU noise). RESULT(S): We interviewed 71 patients; 62% were men (mean age 54.46years) and the mean length of stay was 8days. Biological factors affected 36% and environmental factors affected 20% of the patients. The most common biological factor was anxiety symptoms, which affected 28% of the patients, and the most common environmental factor was noise, which affected 32.4%. The overall mean recorded noise level was 62.45dB. Based on the patients' responses, the environmental factors had a larger effect on patients' sleep quality than biological factors. Patients who stayed more than 5days reported less sleep disturbance. Patients younger than 55years were more affected by environmental and biological factors than were those older than 55years. CONCLUSION(S): Patient quality of sleep in the ICU is associated with environmental factors such as noise and artificial lighting, as well as biological factors related to anxiety and pain. The noise level in the ICU is twice that recommended by international guides. Given the stronger influence of environmental factors, the use of earplugs or sleeping masks is recommended. The longer the hospital stay, the less these factors seem to affect patients' sleep quality.

AB  - Objectives: MR compatible incubators (MRcI) offer the examination of preterm and critically ill infants in controlled environment. The aim of the study was to compare objective and subjective image quality as well as diagnostic value of MRI brain examinations with and without using the MRcI. Thus, predictive value of brain MRI at expected delivery date in general was investigated. Method(s): This retrospective study included MRI brain examinations conducted at patients' corrected age <=6 months and presence of four standard sequences (PD TSE transversal, T2 TSE transversal, T2 TSE sagittal and T1 SE transversal). Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) was calculated. Subjective image quality was estimated using a 5-point Likert scale. Findings of MRI were compared with those of previous transfontanellar ultrasound because of additional diagnostic information. Severe brain abnormality scaled by score of Kidokoro was related to results of Munich Functional Developmental Diagnostics (MFDD) within first year. Result(s): One hundred MRI brain examinations (76 with MRcI, 24 without MRcI) were performed in 79 patients. Using the MRcI SNR and CNR were significantly higher in PD- and in T2-weighted sequences (p<0.05). TSE PD transversal demonstrated a higher risk of non-diagnostic quality using MRcI (OR 5.23; 95%-CI 1.86-14.72). MRcI revealed additional diagnostic information (OR 5.69; 95%-CI 1.15-28.24). Severe brain abnormality was associated with walking deficits (r=0.570; p=0.021). Conclusion(s): The MRcI increased objective image quality and revealed additional diagnostic information to transfontanellar ultrasound. Nevertheless, prediction of infants' future development remains limited.Copyright © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation after major surgery is common and associated with worse outcome. Noise is one important reason for sleep fragmentation, which contributes to enhanced morbidity. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the impact of earplugs on patients' sleep quality during their first night after cardiothoracic surgery to eventually improve an existing fast-track concept. METHOD(S): Sixty-three patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery eligible for a postoperative fast-track regimen on our cardiothoracic post anesthesia care unit (C-PACU) were prospectively included. They were randomized to either sleep with or without earplugs. Quality of sleep was measured using questionnaires for patients and nurses. Required pain medications, pain intensity, and length of hospital stay were secondary outcome variables. RESULT(S): Twenty-seven patients were randomized to the intervention group (earplugs) and 36 to the control group. Mean (SD) age was 61 (12) years. Self-reported quality of sleep was better in the intervention group (median, IQR [range]: 3, 2-4 [1-5] vs. 4, 3-5 [1-5]; scale: 1, "excellent," to 5, "very poor"; P=0.025). Patients of the intervention group also experienced less severe pain (P=0.047) despite similar dosages of administered analgesics and expressed improved satisfaction regarding their C-PACU stay (P=0.032). CONCLUSION(S): Implementation of the use of earplugs in a fast-track concept following cardiothoracic surgery is efficient and easy. Earplugs improved the quality of sleep as well as patient satisfaction and attenuated pain intensity. They may thereby contribute to a faster recovery, less morbidity, and reduced costs.

AB  - In the United States and other parts of the world, recreational firearm shooting is a popular sport that puts the hearing of the shooter at risk. Peak sound pressure levels (SPLs) from firearms range from ~140 to 175 dB. The majority of recreational firearms (excluding small-caliber 0.17 and 0.22 rifles and air rifles) generate between 150 and 165 dB peak SPLs. High-intensity impulse sounds will permanently damage delicate cochlear structures, and thus individuals who shoot firearms are at a higher risk of bilateral, high-frequency, noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) than peer groups who do not shoot. In this article, we describe several factors that influence the risk of NIHL including the use of a muzzle brake, the number of shots fired, the distance between shooters, the shooting environment, the choice of ammunition, the use of a suppressor, and hearing protection fit and use. Prevention strategies that address these factors and recommendations for specialized hearing protectors designed for shooting sports are offered. Partnerships are needed between the hearing health community, shooting sport groups, and wildlife conservation organizations to develop and disseminate accurate information and promote organizational resources that support hearing loss prevention efforts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated clinical care delivered to musicians in Australia by audiologists and manufacturers of musicians' hearing protectors (MHP). DESIGN: Audiologists with experience treating musicians were invited to complete a survey on their service delivery. A second survey was administered to manufacturers of MHPs. STUDY SAMPLE: Four manufacturers of MHP and 31 audiologists completed the surveys. Post hoc analyses were performed comparing the responses of audiologists with more versus less clinical experience; and those with and without musical training. RESULT(S): There was considerable variation in the audiological care provided to musicians. Only one-third of audiologists performed pure-tone audiometry prior to MHP fitting, and there was little consistency across the sample in relation to impression taking, preferred attenuation or selection of canal length. There was also significant variation in the manufacturers' approach to MHP, each of whom provided different recommendations regarding preferred impression techniques and material viscosity. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study reveal lack of consistency across the hearing healthcare sector with respect to care of musicians' hearing, with potential to impact upon the satisfaction with, and usage of, MHP. There is need for evidence-based, best practice guidelines and training to support clinical audiologists in providing optimal care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise exposure and associated hearing loss affects an estimated 2 million farm youth who are exposed as farm residents, farm family workers, hired workers, children of migrant or seasonal workers, and farm visitors. Risk factors for farm youth include frequent exposure to high farm noise; farm work from an early age, and exposure to high recreational noise (e.g., firearms, ATVs, and personal listening devices). METHOD(S): This study compared the effectiveness of two interventions and control. The programs included a community-based interactive youth educational program alone (Group A), a community-based interactive youth educational program followed by an Internet-based booster (Group B), and a no-interaction control (Group C). The study used a cluster randomized control design, with equal allocation ratio to each cluster, without blinding. Inclusion criteria included enrollment in grade 4, parental consent, English speaking, and attending a community-based educational event included in the cluster sampling. A total of 1979 youth were enrolled at 36 sites distributed across the 3 study arms in the following distribution: N =662 in 13 sites (Group A), N =680 in 12 sites (Group B), and N =637 in 11 sites (Group C). RESULT(S): Comparison with pre-intervention data showed no difference in intent to use hearing conservation strategies in experimental groups. However, knowledge and attitudes toward hearing conservation were improved in the groups receiving the Internet-based booster. Participants reported frequent exposure to sources of hazardous noise (e.g., loud sporting events, firecrackers, personal listening devices). CONCLUSION(S): It is feasible and acceptable to incorporate hearing health education into an already existing system designed to deliver health and safety educational programming to farm and rural youth. The program was adopted by the partner agency for dissemination to up to 100,000 youth annually. Results of this study inform future intervention studies, interventions aimed at farm youth, and interventions to increase use of hearing conservation strategies, as well as offer a base for developing programs for non-English speaking children.

AB  - The relationship between incident sound level and acoustic attenutation for four types of earplug and four types of earmuff have been investigated using freshly prepared and instrumented cadaver ears. Pure tones and 1/3 octave bands of random noise in the frequency range 125-8000 Hz were employed as steady-state stimuli with sound pressure levels between 75 and 125 dB. Impulses with peak sound levels in the range 135-175 dB(P) were also presented. For the steady-state signals employed, the eight hearing protectors have been shown to have constant attenuation characteristics over the range of incident sound levels investigated. This was also the case for the six conventional protectors (with intentionally linear characteristics) for the impulse stimuli. The two intentionally amplitude-sensitive protectors provided attenuation which increased with incident sound level for impulse noises. Comparison of the protector attenuation-frequency characteristics determined for steady-state sounds shows good agreement with those obtained from subjective (threshold-shift) national standard measurement procedures. It may be concluded, therefore, that the six conventional hearing protectors studied here have attenuation characteristics that are equal for incident sound levels at about 40 and 75 dB, and that they are constant for levels between 75 and 175 dB. Consequently, the results of national standard threshold-shift procedures, although measured at low sound levels, may be applied with confidence to occupations where hazardous high-level noises are present.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Safety prequalification assessing contractors' safety management systems and safety programs lack validation in predicting construction worker injuries. METHOD(S): Safety assessments of leading indicators from 2198 construction contractors, including Safety Management Systems (SMS), Safety Programs (e.g., falls, hearing protection), and Special Elements (drug testing, return to work) scales as well as the history of citations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were compared to contractors' lagging indicators of recordable injury case rates (RC) and rates of injuries involving days away, restricted, or transferred (DART). RESULT(S): Increased SMS scores were related to lower injury rates. Each one-point increase in SMS values was associated with 34% reduced odds of a recordable case rate greater than zero (Odds ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): (0.57, 0.79)), and a 9% reduced recordable case rate, if one occurs (Risk Ratio (RR): 0.91, 95% CI: (0.88, 0.94)). A one-point increase in SMS was associated with 28% reduced odds of a DART (OR=0.72, 95%CI (0.56, 0.91)), and 9% reduced DART rate, if one occurs (RR=0.91, 95%CI (0.87, 0.95)). Safety programs did not show consistent associations with injury outcomes. Having additional Special Elements related to drug and alcohol programs was associated with lower injury rates while the Special Element related to return to work showed no consistent associations with injury. Having more OSHA Citations was associated with lower injury rates for companies with injuries. CONCLUSION(S): These results support pre-qualification methods based on SMS and suggest the need for safety management systems in contractors.Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing loss and tinnitus are global concerns that can be reduced through hearing protection behaviors (e.g., earplug use). Little is known about the effectiveness of interventions to increase hearing protection use in recreational domains. For the first time we review systematically the effectiveness of such interventions. METHOD(S): Systematic searches of nine databases, as well as grey literature and hand-searching, were conducted. Any study design was included if it assessed quantitatively a purposeful attempt to increase hearing protection in recreational settings. Studies were excluded if they assessed noise exposure from occupational sources and headphones/earphones, as these have been reviewed elsewhere. PROSPERO protocol: CRD42018098573. RESULT(S): Eight studies were retrieved following the screening of 1908 articles. Two pretest-posttest studies detected a small to medium effect (d>=0.3<=0.5), one a small effect (d~=0.2) and two no real effect. Three posttest experimental studies detected small to medium effects (d>=0.3<=0.5). Studies were rated as "poor quality" and 17 out of a possible 93 behavior change techniques were coded, with the majority targeting the intervention function 'education'. CONCLUSION(S): Hearing loss and tinnitus due to recreational noise exposure are major public health concerns yet very few studies have examined preventive interventions. The present systematic review sets the agenda for the future development and testing of evidence-based interventions designed to prevent future hearing loss and tinnitus caused by noise in recreational settings, by recommending systematic approaches to intervention design, and implementation of intervention functions beyond education, such as incentivization, enablement and modeling.

AB  - Purpose. Laffrey's Health Conception Scale (LHCS), an instrument designed to measure personal definitions of health, was reduced with the intent of creating a useful yet less cumbersome version of the LHCS. Design. The original form of the LHCS was tested in a preliminary study, and results were used as a basis for the reduction of the instrument. The original clinical and new overall wellness subscales were subsequently tested with a larger population of manufacturing plant workers. Setting. One chemical plant and three Midwestern manufacturing plants. Subjects. The sample for the preliminary study comprised 94 chemical plant workers. For the larger study, the sample comprised 892 subjects; because this instrument was part of a larger questionnaire to identify predictors of workers' use of hearing protection, only those workers who spent some part of their work time in areas of the plant which required hearing protection use were eligible to participate. Measures. The original LHCS was used in the preliminary study. The reduced LHCS was used in the larger study and psychometrically evaluated. Results. The reduced LHCS accounted for 51% of the variance in definition of health; all but one item had loaded on one of the two factors with a loading of .41 or greater. The revised LHCS demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Two distinct factors, the clinical subscale and the overall wellness subscale, were isolated. Conclusions. The researchers recommend the reduced LHCS be used for assessing subjects' definition of health; the reduced instrument requires fewer items, and therefore less time, to measure individuals' definitions of health with excellent reliability.

AB  - Objective: The way food is perceived is influenced by various factors such as smell, taste and other sensory inputs like visual and external auditory sensations. In this study we examined whether the sound intensity of the chewing sounds themselves influences the perception of food. Method(s): Nineteen normogeusic, normal-hearing subjects (12 female, 7 male, mean age 22.6 years) participated in two randomized test sessions with open and closed (earplug ER 3, Etymotic) auditory canal. In both sessions, they ate eight different food samples of various textures i.e. potato chips, salted pretzels, banana, apple, tomato, carrot or soft and crunchy cereal bars. Subjects were asked to rate the foods' freshness, taste, pleasantness and whether they would like to eat more of the respective item. While chewing, the mastication sound was measured with a probe microphone (ER 7C, Etymotic) in the ear canal. Result(s): There are tendencies showing that the rating of freshness of potato chips, salted pretzels, apple and the soft cereal bar seem to increase when the ear canals are closed with earplugs. Tomatoes, carrots and the crunchy cereal bar were rated less fresh by trend (differences not yet significant). The flavor of carrots was rated significantly less tasteful with earplugs (p = 0.046). Crunchy cereal bars were rated significantly more pleasant with closed ear canals (p = 0.028). Conclusion(s): Preliminary results indicate potential differences in food perception dependent on the intensity of chewing sounds. Hard textures tend to be rated more pleasant when the chewing sound is amplified by earplugs and seemed to be preferred in the ear closed condition. Testing is ongoing to confirm these first pilot data in a larger sample size.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Defence Forces' members are exposed to high-level noise that increases their risk of hearing loss (HL). Besides military noise, the other risk factors include age and gender, ototoxic chemicals, vibration, and chronic stress. The current study was designed to study the effects of personal, work conditions-related risk factors, and other health-related traits on the presence of hearing problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study among active military service members was carried out. Altogether, 807 respondents completed a questionnaire about their health and personal and work-related risk factors in indoor and outdoor environments. The statistical analysis was performed using statistical package of social sciences (descriptive statistics) and R (correlation and regression analysis) software. RESULT(S): Almost half of the active service members reported HL during their service period. The most important risk factors predicting HL in the military appeared to be age, gender, and service duration. Also, working in a noisy environment with exposure to technological, vehicle, and impulse noise shows a statistically significant effect on hearing health. Moreover, we could identify the effect of stress on tinnitus and HL during the service period. Most importantly, active service members not using hearing protectors, tend to have more tinnitus than those who use it. CONCLUSION(S): The members of the Defence Forces experience noise from various sources, most of it resulting from outdoor activities. Personal and work conditions-related risk factors as well as stress increase the risk of hearing problems.Copyright © Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The use of hearing protectors is one of the alternatives that help soften the risk that music at high intensity can cause to a musician's hearing. Objective(s): To analyze the perception of comfort reported by musicians who use specific hearing protectors. Method(s): 43 subjects participated in this study. They were divided into three groups: 11 music students; 7 musicians from a symphony orchestra, and a group of 25 musicians from a military police band. All participants were tested with Hi-FiTM Plug (E-A-R Plugs) hearing protectors during music practices. They also answered a questionnaire about the perception of comfort provided in relation to "attenuation," "pressure in the ear canal," "texture," "instrument handling," "placement," and "verbal communication." The participants also expressed the importance they gave to each of these aspects. Result(s): The lowest score given by the students was to the "placement of the protectors" question. The "attenuation", "pressure in the auditory canal", and "texture" questions obtained a lower score among the orchestra musicians. The "instrument handling" and "verbal communication" questions obtained a lower score among the band musicians. For students, the most important aspect was "instrument handling." For the orchestra musicians, the most important aspects were "attenuation", "pressure in the auditory canal", and "verbal communication." And for the band musicians, the "sonorous attenuation" aspect was the most important. Conclusion(s): The music students were the subjects that evaluated the hearing protectors the highest, followed by the band musicians, and lastly the orchestra musicians. Devices.

AB  - Introduction: Loud music can cause hearing loss and symptoms such as tinnitus. That can lead to the end of a musician's professional career. Objective(s): To analyze the sound exposure and the auditory profile of musicians from a Military Police band. Method(s): 34 musicians (31 men and three women) participated in the study, with an average age of 33.21; and an average time in the band of 7.38 years. Auditory symptoms and knowledge of hearing protection were ascertained. The sound pressure level was evaluated in five trials. Conventional threshold and high frequency tone audiometry were also performed. Result(s): The average sound pressure levels assessed during the five trials ranged from 93.2 to 98.5 dB LAeq for three hours of testing. Six musicians (17.64%) reported tinnitus, which was also reported as most frequent complaint after band practices (11.76%). Only one musician always used hearing protection and 10 musicians (29.41%) never wear hearing protection. Relative to the audiometric profile, eight (23.52%) musicians had thresholds higher than 25 dB HL in one or both ears. The worst average of tonal thresholds, even within normality, occurred at frequencies of 6000 Hz and 11,200 Hz, in both ears. Conclusion(s): The sound exposure of the musicians in a threehour practice exceeds the limits proposed in Brazilian Legislation. Thus, there is a negative impact on the hearing of its participants since audiological losses and presence of tinnitus were diagnosed.

AB  - A hearing protection fit testing was conducted on workers (n = 189) in a textile factory in southern China. The 3M E-A-Rfit Dual-Ear Validation System was used to measure the personal attenuation rating (PAR) on an over-the-head style earmuff at the work site. In addition, PARs were obtained several times throughout the same work shift to capture different fits on 39 workers. Follow-up visits were conducted in approximate 6-month or 12-month intervals to repeat the fit testing. Both the immediate and residual effects of training on the field attenuation of hearing protection devices obtained by workers, and the effects of training toward improving the attenuation and protection of earmuffs after a period of daily use, were observed. A questionnaire survey was used to assess the awareness of hearing health and motivation toward the use of earmuffs in a high temperature environment. The results showed that there were wide variations in PARs among the workers tested. The one-on-one training together with fit testing improved PAR and helped to reduce the negative impact caused by use of protective hair covers. Since earmuffs are often used for long periods of time (>1 year), repeating fit tests could be helpful in order to verify the attenuation received throughout their useful life.

AB  - Objectives: To use clinically accessible tools to determine unitlevel and individual patient factors associated with sound levels and sleep disruption in a range of representative ICUs. Design(s): A cross-sectional, observational study. Setting(s): Australian and New Zealand ICUs. Patient(s): All patients 16 years or over occupying an ICU bed on one of two Point Prevalence study days in 2015. Intervention(s): Ambient sound was measured for 1 minute using an application downloaded to a personal mobile device. Bedside nurses also recorded the total time and number of awakening for each patient overnight. Measurements and Main Results: The study included 539 participants with sound level recorded using an application downloaded to a personal mobile device from 39 ICUs. Maximum and mean sound levels were 78 dB (sd, 9) and 62 dB (sd, 8), respectively. Maximum sound levels were higher in ICUs with a sleep policy or protocol compared with those without maximum sound levels 81 dB (95% CI, 79-83) versus 77 dB (95% CI, 77-78), mean difference 4 dB (95% CI, 0-2), p < 0.001. There was no significant difference in sound levels regardless of single room occupancy, mechanical ventilation status, or illness severity. Clinical nursing staff in all 39 ICUs were able to record sleep assessment in 15-minute intervals. The median time awake and number of prolonged disruptions were 3 hours (interquartile range, 1-4) and three (interquartile range, 2-5), respectively. Conclusion(s): Across a large number of ICUs, patients were exposed to high sound levels and substantial sleep disruption irrespective of factors including previous implementation of a sleep policy. Sound and sleep measurement using simple and accessible tools can facilitate future studies and could feasibly be implemented into clinical practice.Copyright © 2017 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Objectives Exposure to environmental noise has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, but evidence for occupational noise is limited and conflicting, especially related to pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the association of occupational noise exposure with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes. Methods Our population-based cohort study utilized data on 1 109 516 singletons born to working mothers in Sweden between 1994-2014 from the Medical Birth Register and the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies. Noise exposure came from a job exposure matrix (JEM) in five categories <70, 70-74, 75-80, 80-85, >85 dB(A). Relative risks (RR), adjusted for confounders and other job exposures, were calculated by modified Poisson regressions for the full sample and a subsample of first-time mothers reporting full-time work. Results Exposure to 80-85 dB(A) of noise was associated with an increased risk of all HDP [RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.18] and preeclampsia alone (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.22) in the full sample. Results were similar for first-pregnancy, full-time workers. Exposure to >85 dB(A) of noise was also associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.10-2.24) in the analysis restricted to first-time mothers working full-time. Conclusion In this study, exposure to noise was associated with an increased risk for HDP and gestational diabetes, particularly in first-time mothers who work full-time. Further research is needed to confirm findings and identify the role of hearing protection on this association so prevention policies can be implemented.Copyright © 2021, Nordic Association of Occupational Safety and Health.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to synthesize available cohorts about the relationship between various types of noise and hypertension, and to explore the potential dose-response relationship between them in an updated meta-analysis. Method(s): PubMed and Embase were searched through October 2019 to identify cohort studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria. A random-effects model was used to combine the results of included studies. Dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to examine the potential dose-response relationship. Result(s): Eleven cohort studies involving 224,829 participants were included in this systematic review. Pooled result showed that living or working in environment with noise exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of hypertension (RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.32), with low heterogeneity (P = 0.098, I2 = 42.1%). We found no evidence of a nonlinear association of elevated noise with hypertension risk (P = 0.443). The summary risk ratio of hypertension for an increment of per 10 dB(A) of noise was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.28), with moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.003, I2 = 72.1%). Conclusion(s): Integrated evidence from cohort studies supports the hypothesis that exposure to noise may be a risk factor of hypertension.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Background/Objectives: MRI is a popular method in modern diagnostic medicine. However, MRI equipment produces 65 to 130 kHz noise when operated, which can cause patients to feel anxious or fear enclosed spaces. To lower the level of noise, method such as earplugs and headsets have been used. Method/Statistical Analysis: In this study, the researchers tried to find out the effective sound insulation method by measuring the degree of noise heard by the patients and evaluating the difference of noise by sound insulation material. A sound meter was placed in a water phantom made outside the magnetic field of the MRI to measure the noise using four sequences (EPI, T1, T2, GRE) and compared it to the sound felt by the patient. Finding(s): As a result, the average noise felt by the patient was measured to be 92.5 dB at EPI, 73.1 dB at T1, 87.4 dB at T2, and finally 74.4 dB at GRE. The average noise when the earplug was worn was measured to be 84.4 dB at EPI, 66.3 dB at T1, 79.4 dB at T2, and 67.7 dB at GRE. The average noise value when the headset was worn was measured to be 78.2 dB at EPI, 61.3 dB at T1, 74.4 dB at T2, and 65.3 dB at GRE. Finally, the average noise when both earplug and headset were simultaneously worn was measured to be 77.4 dB at EPI, 60.5 dB at T1, 73.3 dB at T2, and 63.4 dB at GRE respectively. Based on the above result, the most effective sound insulation was made when both earplug and headset were worn at the same time, the next effective sound insulation method was headset wearing, and the least sound insulation method was earplug wearing. Improvements/Applications: If it is not possible to apply a fundamental management method to eliminate the causes of noise, which is difficult to practice in actual clinical practice, it is suggested that hearing protection gear should be actively used to reduce the degree of noise-exposed to patients.Copyright © 2020, World Informations Syndicate.

AB  - Frontline military personnel are at high risk of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) caused by impulse noise, such as weapon firing or blast. This can result in anatomic disruption of the tympanic membrane and damage to the middle and inner ear, leading to conductive, sensorineural, or mixed hearing loss that may be temporary or permanent. AAT reduces warfighters' operational effectiveness and has implications for future quality of life. Hearing protection devices can mitigate AAT but are not completely protective. Novel therapeutic options now exist; therefore, identification of AAT as soon as possible from point of injury is vital to ensure optimal treatment and fulfillment of the duty of care. Early recognition and treatment of frontline AAT can maintain the deployed team's capabilities, avoid unnecessary case evacuation (CASEVAC), and raise awareness of military occupational AAT. This will help prioritize hearing preservation, maintain the fighting force, and ultimately retain personnel in service. The UK Defence hearWELL research collaboration has developed a frontline protocol for the assessment of AAT utilizing future-facing technology developed by the US Department of Defense: the Downrange Acoustic Toolbox (DAT). The DAT has been operationally deployed since 2019 and has successfully identified AAT requiring treatment, thereby improving casualties' hearing and reducing unnecessary repatriation.Copyright 2020.

AB  - Background: Many public health professionals have expressed concern that regular participation in recreational settings with high noise levels might induce hearing loss. This study measures the noise levels in a baseball stadium and analyzes baseball fans' attitude of effect of recreational noise exposure on their hearing. Method(s): In the baseball stadium, noise levels from the beginning to the end of four games were measured in four seating sections, the red, blue, navy, and outfield sections using a sound level meter. For the survey sample, 344 randomly selected participants who visited the stadium and/or were baseball fans completed a 16-question survey on their noise exposure during the game and on the potential risk of hearing loss. Result(s): The LAeq average of the 16 measures produced 91.7 dBA, showing a significantly high noise level in the red and navy sections. As a function of frequency by LZeq analysis, the noise levels of low frequencies between 0.05 and 1kHz were significantly higher than other frequencies except for the outfield section, but the levels abruptly decreased above 1kHz. Despite the very high noise levels, 70% of the respondents preferred sitting in either the red or the navy section to be closer to the cheerleaders and to obtain a good view. Most respondents reported that they did not consider wearing earplugs, and one-third experienced hearing muffled speech after the game. Notably, they agreed that an information announcement regarding loud noise and hearing protection was needed at the stadium. Conclusion(s): We conclude that the noise levels in baseball stadiums are high enough to cause hearing damage and/or tinnitus later when applying a rule of 85dB LAeq for 8 hours with a 3-dB exchange rate. We expect these results to improve public education regarding safe noise exposure during popular sports activities.

AB  - Hearing loss has become the most common disability among veterans. Understanding how blast waves propagate through the human ear is a necessary step in the development of effective hearing protection devices (HPDs). This article presents the first 3D finite element (FE) model of the human ear to simulate blast wave transmission through the ear. The 3D FE model of the human ear consisting of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, and middle ear cavity was imported into ANSYS Workbench for coupled fluid-structure interaction analysis in the time domain. Blast pressure waveforms recorded external to the ear in human cadaver temporal bone tests were applied at the entrance of the ear canal in the model. The pressure waveforms near the tympanic membrane (TM) in the canal (P1) and behind the TM in the middle ear cavity (P2) were calculated. The model-predicted results were then compared with measured P1 and P2 waveforms recorded in human cadaver ears during blast tests. Results show that the model-derived P1 waveforms were in an agreement with the experimentally recorded waveforms with statistic Kurtosis analysis. The FE model will be used for the evaluation of HPDs in future studies.

AB  - Speech communication often takes place in noisy environments; this is an urgent issue for military personnel who must communicate in high-noise environments. The effects of noise on speech recognition vary significantly according to the sources of noise, the number and types of talkers, and the listener's hearing ability. In this review, speech communication is first described as it relates to current standards of hearing assessment for military and civilian populations. The next section categorizes types of noise (also called maskers) according to their temporal characteristics (steady or fluctuating) and perceptive effects (energetic or informational masking). Next, speech recognition difficulties experienced by listeners with hearing loss and by older listeners are summarized, and questions on the possible causes of speech-in-noise difficulty are discussed, including recent suggestions of "hidden hearing loss". The final section describes tests used by military and civilian researchers, audiologists, and hearing technicians to assess performance of an individual in recognizing speech in background noise, as well as metrics that predict performance based on a listener and background noise profile. This article provides readers with an overview of the challenges associated with speech communication in noisy backgrounds, as well as its assessment and potential impact on functional performance, and provides guidance for important new research directions relevant not only to military personnel, but also to employees who work in high noise environments.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effects of hearing protection devices (HPDs) and head protection on the ability of normal-hearing individuals to localize reverse alarms in background noise. BACKGROUND: Among factors potentially contributing to accidents involving heavy vehicles, reverse alarms can be difficult to localize in space, leading to errors in identifying the source of danger. Previous studies have shown that traditional tonal alarms are more difficult to localize than broadband alarms. In addition, HPDs and safety helmets may further impair localization. METHOD(S): Standing in the middle of an array of eight loudspeakers, participants with and without HPDs (passive and level-dependent) had to identify the loudspeaker emitting a single cycle of the alarm while performing a task on a tablet computer. RESULT(S): The broadband alarm was easier to localize than the tonal alarm. Passive HPDs had a significant impact on sound localization (earmuffs generally more so than earplugs), particularly double hearing protection, and level-dependent HPDs did not fully restore sound localization abilities. The safety helmet had a much lesser impact on performance than HPDs. CONCLUSION(S): Where good sound localization abilities are essential in noisy workplaces, the broadband alarm should be used, double hearing protection should be avoided, and earplug-style passive or level-dependent devices may be a better choice than earmuff-style devices. Construction safety helmets, however, seem to have only a minimal effect on sound localization. APPLICATION: Results of this study will help stakeholders make decisions that are more informed in promoting safer workplaces.

AB  - To determine if conventional audiometry, EHFA, and pDPOAEs are useful as early indicators of cochlear damage from recreational firearm impulse noise exposure in youth firearm users. Quantitative cross-sectional descriptive pilot study. Descriptive statistics and MANOVA with post hoc Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test were used to compare pDPOAEs (1-10kHz), conventional audiometry (0.25-8kHz), and EHFA (10-16kHz) in YFUs. 25 YFUs (n=11 7-12 years; n=14 13-17 years) with self-reported poor compliance with hearing protector device wear. Conventional audiometric thresholds at 2-, 3- and 4kHz were significantly poorer than normal but did not distinguish between older and younger YFUs or between the GBE and the contralateral ear. EHFA thresholds at 14- and 16kHz were significantly poorer than for other frequencies, and differentiate between older and younger youths, but do not distinguish the GBE from the contralateral ear. Finally, pDPOAE levels were significantly reduced at 8- and 10kHz but did not show any differences for the younger versus older YFUs or for the GBE from the contralateral ear. Conclusion(s): Both EHFA and pDPOAEs provide early evidence of NIHL in YFUs, and may be useful for the early detection of NIHL in YFUs.

AB  - Hearing protectors are selected for the workstation noise using octave bands (OB), HML and SNR methods. The purpose of the study was to determine how the frequency components in the noise can affect the result of the selection of hearing protectors. In total, 55 hearing protectors were selected for four types of real occurred noise, high-frequency noise, low-frequency noise and eight simulated noises. An analysis showed that the noise type affects the accuracy of selection carried out using HML and SNR methods. For a noise with the presence of dominant frequency components, the result of the selection carried out using the HML method deviates from the result of the OB method by 7 dB and 9 dB for earmuffs and earplugs, respectively. The study shows that the use of HML and SNR methods may lead to wrong assessment as to the effectiveness of hearing protection with the selected hearing protectors.

AB  - In a work environment, in addition to noise, people may be exposed to other harmful factors. Therefore, they wear both hearing protectors and other personal protective equipment (OPPE). Incorrect use of such a combination may increase the risk of hearing loss. The aim of this study was to determine whether the simultaneous use of earmuffs and other personal protective equipment could affect the effectiveness of hearing protection. The study was carried out under laboratory conditions using an acoustic test fixture. This fixture replicated the anatomical shapes of the head and the pinnae, and was also equipped with ear simulators. The study was carried out for five models of earmuffs and eight models of other personal protection equipment. We found that a change in the sound pressure level (SPL) under the earmuffs when using a full face respirator could reach up to 40 dB. On the other hand, the use of a half respirator had practically no adverse impact on the efficiency of hearing protection. In the selection process, it is recommended to consider safety spectacles equipped with thin temples, and half respirators equipped with band adjustment elements positioned on the facial part, rather than the back, of the user's head.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces brief but very loud sound impulses-the TMS "coil click". This sound causes several side effects of TMS, ranging from confounds in simultaneous functional brain imaging data to potential hearing safety risks for the subject and operator. Accurate data on the sound emitted by TMS coils is lacking, however. Objective(s): We aim to accurately characterize the sound emitted by seven TMS coils from three manufacturers and compare the sound to hearing safety standards. Material(s) and Method(s): We recorded a database of sound waveforms from the seven coils with 300-50,000 Hz bandwidth. To compare the coils, we also measured their induced electric field and estimated their neural stimulation strength by applying a strength-duration model to account for different waveforms. Result(s): For single TMS pulses, the peak sound pressure level (SPL) was between 98-125 dB(Z) for operators and 112-139 dB(Z) for subjects at maximum stimulator output across the coils. For repetitive TMS (rTMS), the continuous sound level was 76-95 dB(A) for the operator and 90-109 dB(A) for the subject during a 20 Hz rTMS pulse train at 120% motor threshold of a representative high-threshold subject. Conclusion(s): TMS noise level has large variability between coils; the difference between loudest and quietest coil is comparable to difference between no hearing protection and properly worn earplugs. The rTMS sound level can exceed several regulatory exposure limits (MIL-STD-1474E, ACGIH, and some near-ultrasound limits) for TMS subjects and, in some cases, for operators. For the subjects there may be additional sources of risk such as skull conduction and near-field sound pressure peaks. These findings are consistent with the current TMS safety guidelines that recommend the use of hearing protection. For operators these concerns could be addressed alternatively with noise monitoring or increased distance from the coil (Fig. 1).Copyright © 2020

AB  - Introduction: Due to electromagnetic forces within the coil, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) generates brief but very loud ([Formula presented]100 dB) clicking sound. Consequently, each TMS pulse delivers acoustic stimulation of auditory brain circuits. This compromises the quality of simultaneous recordings of brain activity and may have unintended neuromodulatory effects. Objective(s): We aim to reduce the acoustic noise of TMS coils by >40 phon (perceptual dB) by acoustic optimization of the coils and by power electronics capable of ultra-brief TMS pulses (<50 [Formula presented] total pulse duration). Material(s) and Method(s): We have developed a model of the mechanical vibrations in TMS coils with time-dependent finite element method. The model allows predicting acoustic properties of TMS coils. We have further incorporated this model into our computational coil-optimization pipeline to optimize the structure of a TMS coil, including its windings, for minimum acoustic noise. Result(s): We have fabricated prototypes of such quiet TMS (qTMS) coils, one of which is shown in Fig. 1, for benchtop measurements with conventional TMS devices. Our preliminary results with first two prototype coils indicate sound pressure level reductions in excess of 25 dB (a factor of 300 in sound power) with conventional biphasic TMS pulses. This reduction is already larger than the difference between use of no hearing protection and the use of properly worn earplugs. Conclusion(s): We present a first systematic approach to mitigate the coil click. The obtained sound reduction from the qTMS coils could make coil click inaudible with moderate noise masking, and consequently could remove the acoustic artifact from simultaneous functional imaging data.Copyright © 2020

AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe health problems experience a high rate of sleep deprivation that harms their psychological and physiological health. Environmental factors are considered to be the greatest cause of sleep deprivation in the ICU, and noise and light are leading among these factors. This study aimed to investigate the effect of eye masks and earplugs on the sleep quality and vital signs of conscious ICU patients. METHOD(S): This study used a quasi-experimental, in similar groups, pretest-posttest design with a control group. The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) was used to collect data, and vital signs were recorded every 2 hours. On day 1, standard care was provided to the experimental group (n = 32), and they were provided with eye masks and earplugs on day 2. The control group (n = 32) was provided with standard care on both days. Chi-square, t, and McNemar and McNemar-Bowker tests were used to analyze the data. Multiple regression analysis was used for predictive analysis. RESULT(S): The RCSQ mean (SD) pretest and posttest scores were 50.21 (16.02) and 68.50 (17.57), respectively, for the experimental group and 55.34 (16.62) and 49.03 (15.53), respectively, for the control group. In the experimental group, the posttest RCSQ score was significantly higher than the pretest RCSQ score (P < .01). No differences in vital signs were observed in the control group. All the vital signs were found to be similar in the experimental group, except for the mean daily pulse rate. CONCLUSION(S): The use of earplugs and eye masks may help reduce sleep deprivation. Eye masks and earplugs can be used by nurses to improve the sleep quality of patients in ICUs.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Neuroscience Nurses.

AB  - Welding light can cause photic retinal injury. We report binocular maculopathy induced by a brief exposure to electric arc welding light in a patient who could not equipped with protective device because of narrow space. A 47-year-old man performed electric arc welding for approximately 10-15 min without wearing protective device because of narrow space and subsequently experienced eye discomfort and decreased visual acuity. At the initial visit, his best corrected visual acuity was 0.5. Fundus examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) were performed. OCT showed disruption in the ellipsoid zone, and mfERG amplitudes in the central 10degree were markedly reduced in both eyes. The decrease in visual acuity had been noted for at least 18 months. Using the proper protective device is essential in welding, despite short time periods of work. For patients with welding-induced photokeratitis, doctors should also consider the possibility of photic retinal injury.Copyright © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adolescent farmworkers are exposed to loud noise during farm activities. We present a prospective study that evaluated the efficacy of low-cost, technology-based intervention approaches in high schools to enhance the use of hearing protection among adolescent farmworkers. DESIGN: Six high schools in Iowa that agreed to participate in the study were divided into three equal groups through cluster-randomisation with each group receiving one of the three formats of hearing protection intervention: (a) classroom training, (b) classroom training coupled with smartphone app training and (c) computer training. Participants completed baseline (pre-training) and six-week post-intervention surveys for assessing hearing protection knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. STUDY SAMPLE: Seventy participants from six schools were initially enrolled but 50 completed both pre- and post-intervention surveys. RESULT(S): In most cases, all three groups showed significant improvement in hearing protection knowledge, attitude and frequency of use from pre- to post-intervention. However, changes between groups were statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION(S): Although all three formats led to improvements on hearing protection knowledge, attitude and behaviour, the findings of the study, perhaps due to the small sample size, did not allow us to detect whether technology-based hearing protection interventions were more effective than the traditional face-to-face training for adolescent farmworkers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of hearing protection devices (HPDs) on speech intelligibility in Persian work environments. Three current earmuffs and three earplugs and one of the prototypes of molded earplug were tested on 15 male subjects which were randomly selected. The noise reduction of HPDs was measured based on the Real Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) method. Speech intelligibility during using HPDs was determined based on the speech discrimination score (SDS) at two signal to noise (S/N) ratios (0 and+5). Data were analyzed using SPSS 22. RESULT(S): The actual to nominal noise reduction rating values were from 47 to 84% for HPDs. At two S/N ratios, no significant differences were observed in speech intelligibility using HPDs (p>0.05). At S/N ratio=0, the speech intelligibility descriptively has been only improved by using common earmuffs up to 9.07%. There was a significant difference up to 21.27% in speech intelligibility for proposed molded earplugs at S/N ratio=0 (p<0.05). Increasing the HPDs' noise attenuation values led to an increase in speech interference (p<0.05). The HPDs with the minimum required noise attenuation while maintaining acceptable speech intelligibility should be worn by employees exposed to medium noise levels.

AB  - PURPOSE: The current study aimed to investigate the knowledge of mineworkers regarding noise-induced hearing loss in the South African gold and non-ferrous mining subsectors. METHOD(S): A descriptive research design was adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 90 participants who comprised managers, supervisors and miners. Data were analysed qualitatively. RESULT(S): The majority of participants (97%) acknowledged working in a noisy environment and demonstrated knowledge of the consequences of this exposure on their hearing function. Although all but one participant indicated having known the importance of using hearing protection devices (HPDs), less than 50% reported consistent use of HPDs. This highlights gaps in education and training, as well as implementation monitoring. All participants reported knowledge regarding the importance of hearing monitoring, but a lack of understanding of their test results. CONCLUSION(S): Current findings contribute towards evidence regarding internal barriers to effective application of best practice in hearing conservation programmes (HCPs). Findings highlight the important role of occupational audiologists in South African mines and the need for individualized education during medical surveillance to enhance efficacy of HCPs. Comprehensive education and training programmes regarding noise exposure and exposure measurements with consistent HPD efficiency assessments are recommendations emanating from these findings.

AB  - RESULTS: Measurements reported here show noise levels of 105 dB or greater in all operating conditions. The fueling location at the left rear of the aircraft near the auxiliary power unit (APU) is the area of greatest risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Additionally, sound field contours indicate noise hazard areas (>85 dBA SPL) can extend beyond 100 ft from the helicopter., CONCLUSIONS: This report details the areas of greatest risk for auditory injury around the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. Our findings suggest the area of hazardous noise levels around the aircraft can extend to neighboring aircraft, particularly on the side of the aircraft where the APU is located. Hearing protection should be worn whenever the aircraft is operating, even if working at a distance.Jones HG, Greene NT, Chen MR, Azcona CM, Archer BJ, Reeves ER. The danger zone for noise hazards around the Black Hawk helicopter. Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2018; 89(6):547-551., BACKGROUND: During ground operations, rotary-wing aircraft engines and subsystems produce noise hazards that place airfield personnel at risk for hearing damage. The noise exposure levels outside the aircraft during various operating conditions, and the distances from aircraft at which they drop to safe levels, are not readily available. The current study measured noise levels at various positions around the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter for three operating conditions typically used when the aircraft is on the ground., METHODS: Microphones were positioned systematically around the helicopter and A-weighted sound pressure levels (SPLs) were computed from the recordings. In addition, the 85-dBA SPL contour around the aircraft was mapped. The resulting A-weighted SPLs and contour mapping were used to determine the noise hazard area around the helicopter.

AB  - Background: Gas-fired electric plants are equipped with heavy machines, which produce hazards including noise pollution. Exposure to high level of noise of above 85dB(A) is known to bring about Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). This study aimed to assess noise exposure level and reported prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among workers in gas-fired electric plants. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted in three gas-fired electric plants in Dar es Salaam (Plant A, Plant B and Plant C) from July to August 2017. A noise logging dosimeter was used to measure personal noise exposure level. A questionnaire was used to collect information on managerial factors, individual factors, socio-demographic factors and history of the participants. A short screening validated questionnaire was used to obtain noise exposure score. Frequency distribution, Chi-square test and Regression analyses were done using SPSS version 20. Result(s): One hundred and six participants were involved in the study. Noise exposure level among gas-fired electric plant workers was above 85dB(A), n = 37. The equivalent sound level (LAeq) measured over 8 hours was (98.6 +/- 9.7) dB(A). The mean noise peak level was (139.5 +/- 9.4) dB(A). Plant C had higher mean noise exposure level (TWA) of (96.9 +/- 5.1) dB(A) compared to plant B 96.4 +/- 3.7dB(A) and plant A 78.7 +/- 11.9dB(A). Participants in both operation and maintenance had higher equivalent sound level (LAeq) measured over eight hours of 101.980 +/- 3.6dB(A) compared to maintenance alone 98.5 +/- 12.4dB (A) or operation 97.7 +/- 8.8dB (A). Proportion of participants with reported hearing loss was 57(53.8%) where 44(41.5%) participants reported difficulty hearing people during conversations. Hearing protective devices (HPDs) were reported to be used by a majority, 101(95.3%). Conclusion(s): Workers in gas-fired plants are exposed to high noise levels that could damage their hearing. Hearing conservation programs should be established and maintained in this work environment.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To determine whether a single 51-minute exposure to acoustic noise during 3-T multisequence magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging could affect the hearing threshold of healthy adults with earplugs and sponge mats as hearing protection. Material(s) and Method(s): With earplugs and motion-refraining sponge mats as hearing protection, 26 healthy young adults underwent 3-T MR neuroimaging imaging that included T1-weighted three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence, T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequence, diffusion-tensor imaging, diffusion- kurtosis imaging, T2*-weighted three-dimensional multiecho gradient-echo sequence, and blood oxygen level-dependent imaging. Automated auditory brainstem response (ABR) was used to measure the hearing thresholds within 24 hours before, within 20 minutes after, and 25 days after the MR examination. One-way repeatedmeasure analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment was used to compare automated ABR results among the three tests and partial h2 (hp 2) was reported as a measure of effect size. Result(s): Automated ABR results showed significantly increased mean threshold shift of 5.0 dB 6 8.1 (standard deviation) (left ear: 4.8 dB 6 9.2 [95% confidence interval: 1.09, 8.53], hp 2 = 0.221, P = .013; right ear: 5.2 dB 6 6.9 [95% confidence interval: 2.36, 8.02], hp 2 = 0.364, P = .001) immediately after the MR examination compared with the baseline study. This shift is below the temporary threshold shift of 40-50 dB that is associated with cochlea nerve changes. Automated ABR obtained at day 25 after MR imaging showed no significant differences from baseline (left ear: 22.3 dB 6 8.6 [95% confidence interval: 25.79, 1.78], hp 2 = 0.069, P = .185; right ear: 0.4 dB 6 7.3 [95% confidence interval: 23.35, 2.58], hp 2 = 0.003, P = .791). Conclusion(s): A 3-T MR neuroimaging examination with the acoustic noise at equivalent sound pressure level of 103.5-111.3 dBA lasting 51 minutes can cause temporary hearing threshold shift in healthy volunteers with hearing protection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION. Sleep is one of the most basic physiological needs of human beings. One third of life is spent in sleep. Sufficient sleep can make people relieve fatigue, better restore their mental and physical strength, maintain a good awakening state after sleep, improve work efficiency, and is also a necessary condition for the rehabilitation of patients in intensive care unit. However, a large number of studies have shown that ICU patients suffer from sleep disturbances due to various factors, and more than 80% of ICU patients have sleep disorders. Sleep disorders or sleep cycle disturbances cause great damage to the body, especially for ICU critically ill patients. Therefore, it is very important to find interventions to improve sleep disorders in ICU patients. At present, the commonly used interventions in clinical practice are divided into drug therapy and non-drug intervention. Drug therapy includes sedative drugs, analgesic drugs and hypnotic drugs. Although the use of sedative analgesic hypnotics is quickly and effective, it is easy to cause different degrees adverse reactions and drug dependence, so non-pharmacological interventions are receiving more and more attention. At present, the study on the effect of non-drug intervention on improving sleep quality in ICU patients has been started in clinical practice, but the results are not the same, and there is no reliable clinical research literature support. Network meta-analysis is a method developed from traditional meta-analysis. Its greatest advantage is that it can summarize the different interventions for treating similar diseases and perform quantitative statistical analysis according to a certain result. OBJECTIVES. To study the effect of non-drug intervention on improving sleep quality in ICU patients by network meta-analysis. METHODS. Computer search database The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Database (WanFang Data), VIP Database (VIP) and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), search and construction The library reviewed the RCT literature on nonpharmaceutical interventions to improve the sleep quality of ICU patients in December 2018, using the Stata13.0 software for network meta-analysis. RESULTS. This study included 18 RCTs with a total of 1720 patients and 11 non-pharmacological interventions. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) network meta-analysis showed that non-drug interventions improved sleep quality in ICU patients, and comprehensive nursing interventions, lavender essential oil aromatherapy, eye masks, eye masks and earplugs were statistically different from conventional care. There was no significant difference between the Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale and the VSH sleep scale. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ranked as follows: eye mask and earplugs > eye mask > comprehensive nursing intervention > lavender essential oil aromatherapy > routine care. CONCLUSION. Based on the results of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) network meta-analysis and ranking results, non-drug intervention eye mask and earplugs were the best in improving sleep quality in ICU patients compared with other interventions.

AB  - Background: Listening to music as a means of relieving anxiety has been examined in several studies, but the results are contradictory and inconclusive. Aim(s): We aimed to investigate if music could reduce anxiety prior to and during bronchoscopy, and whether this reduction is influenced by personal preference in music. Method(s): In this randomised controlled trial, we included 300 patients undergoing investigation for suspected lung cancer from October 2016 until November 2017. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: selfselected music, specially designed music (MusiCureTM), or control (no music). All patients wore earplugs during the procedure, to ensure blinding of the staff. Spielberger's StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered three times: at admission, after 20 minutes with or without music, (before bronchoscopy), and shortly before discharge. The primary outcome was change in the STAI score from admission to 20 minutes with or without music. Result(s): On average, music reduced the STAI score by 2.7 (95%CI: 1.1 to 4.2; p<0.01) compared with the control group; this reduction was greatest in the self-selected music group (3.3; 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.4; p<0.01). In contrast, specially designed music did not significantly reduce the STAI score (1.9; 95% CI: 0.2 to 4.1; p=0.09), with no significant differences between the two music groups (p=0.3). Upon discharge, the anxiety levels were similar in all groups (p=0.4). Conclusion(s): Listening to music reduces anxiety in patients undergoing bronchoscopy. This reduction is likely affected by personal preferences and further work is now needed to determine the optimal use of music in this patient population.

AB  - Background. 270 million workplace accidents occur annually. In Uganda, Kampala district has the highest workplace injury and fatality rates. However, information on personal protective equipment (PPE) - hand gloves, hardhats, overalls, safety boots, earplugs, safety harness with lanyard, and face shields - utilization among building construction workers remains scarce. We assessed PPE utilization and determinants among building construction workers in Kampala, Uganda. Methods. This cross-sectional study involved 385 respondents. Data collected by structured questionnaire was double-entered in EpiData and analyzed in STATA at 5% significance level. Independent determinants of PPE use were established by a stepwise backward logistic regression analysis. Results. 305 (79.2%) respondents were males, 290 (75.3%) were 18-30 years, 285 (74.0%) completed secondary education, and 197 (51.2%) were temporary employees. 60 (15.6%) respondents used PPE. Female sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 6.64; 95% CI: 1.55-28.46; P=0.011), temporary (AOR = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01-0.27; P<0.001) and casual (AOR = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.001-0.071; P<0.001) employment, and previous knowledge of safety measures (AOR = 100.72; 95% CI: 26.00-390.16; P<0.001) were associated with PPE use. Conclusion. PPE use was low in Kampala, Uganda. Building construction companies should implement measures of the Uganda Occupational Health and Safety Act.Copyright © 2017 Jonathan Izudi et al.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Introduction: Increasing technological development and the expansion of market demand have meant that industrial activity has needed to extend production to 24 hours a day, resulting in multiple work shifts. In order to stay in the market, the worker needs to adapt to this reality by performing work in shifts, along with their possible health implications. Objective(s): To analyze the impact of rotating shifts on the hearing health of workers exposed to noise. Method(s): A questionnaire and audiometry were performed with the workers. They were separated into two groups: Rotating Shift and Day Shift. Result(s): It was verified that audiometric results depend on the shift (p = 0.0089). The workers in the Rotating Shift group presented 2.76 times the chance of presenting NIHL, and the shift was considered a risk factor. A predominance of auditory and extraauditory symptoms/complaints was found in the Rotating Shift Group in relation to the Day Shift Group, but without a significant statistical relationship, except for headache and sleep disturbance. There were fewer occurrences of alterations and symptoms/complaints in these workers than the ones reported in the literature. This may be justified by the use of hearing protection and by the actions performed in the hearing conservation program (HCP). Conclusion(s): There is a necessity to implement a HCP that contains a systematic follow-up of the auditory health of the workers from the rotating shift.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing problems among young adults are increasing due to participation in loud activities. This study explored attitudes towards leisure noise, hearing protection, and perceived susceptibility to noise damage in young adults with no diagnosed hearing problems. Understanding attitudes and behaviours will assist with the future development of strategies to improve awareness and use of hearing protection. DESIGN: A qualitative study. STUDY SAMPLE: Four focus groups, with 28 adults aged 18-35 years (6 male; 22 female; mean age 23 years). RESULT(S): Using framework analysis, five themes emerged. Earplug use occurred when participants had experienced previous temporary hearing damage (i.e. short-lived tinnitus or hearing loss). Others chose not to use earplugs because music venues are expected to be loud. Peer behaviours and opinions also had a strong influence over earplug use. A lack of knowledge of hearing-related damage resulted in a lack of concern for hearing health and other health conditions taking priority. CONCLUSION(S): The challenge is to present hearing health messages that are relevant and accessible to young adults. Music and entertainment venues must also take greater responsibility to protect the hearing of its customers by at least informing visitors of the dangers of loud music.

AB  - This study explored attitudes toward leisure noise, use of hearing protection, and perceived susceptibility to leisure-noise damage in young adults with hearing problems. Twelve participants aged between 18 and 35 years took part in a semistructured interview. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. The results showed that a positive attitude to noise, a passion for loud music, a lack of knowledge of the consequences of noise damage, and perceived low risk of hearing problems were associated with people not using earplugs. The aesthetics, comfort, perceived effects on music quality and attitude of others were all barriers to earplug use. Of those who had used earplugs, previous hearing-related symptoms and concern about future hearing damage were the main motivators for use. Four types of people were identified to describe the variation in attitudes and behaviors: those who had no change in behavior or concern about damage; those who were concerned and used earplugs; those who were concerned and avoided loud venues; and those who were concerned about communication difficulties only. Considering the wide variability, it may be more effective to shift attention from trying to change individual attitudes and behaviors to considering systemic changes to protect hearing, through ensuring the music industry and relevant authorities take greater responsibility.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Poor sleep is common among post-cardiac surgery inpatients. Cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) and cardiac ward nurses are well positioned to ensure that adequate sleep is promoted and sleep disturbing factors are lessened. However, little is known about the sleep promotion practices used by nurses and the factors influencing their use in post-cardiac surgery inpatients. Our purpose was to determine: (1) the type and extent of sleep promotion practices used by cardiac nurses, (2) the barriers and facilitators influencing their use, and (3) whether there is a difference between the CSICU and ward settings. Methods/Results: A cross-sectional online survey was used, which was accessible on REDCap. This survey was guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework and created by the researchers. The target population was cardiac nurses at a cardiac care center in eastern Ontario. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics for Mac. The survey yielded 106 respondents (51.2% response rate). Of those, 91 completed the survey (n=41 CSICU and n=50 ward). The most commonly reported sleep promotion practices were helping the patient achieve a comfortable position in bed, providing additional bedding and clustering care. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between the ward and CISCU existed across multiple items, including: providing headphones (p=0.001), providing earplugs (p=0.003), room temperature adjustments (p=0.002), and talking in quiet voices (p=0.035). The most common sleep promotion practice facilitators across both settings were knowledge regarding its health benefits and an understanding of its importance. The most common sleep promotion practice barriers across both settings were encountering problems when promoting sleep and an absence of recognition from important healthcare professionals. Factors influencing sleep promotion practice usage were similar across settings, yet differences existed. For instance, ward nurses labelled the following items as barriers, however in the CSICU they were labelled as facilitators: the amount of time to promote sleep, being trained on how to promote sleep in general, and emotional exhaustion affecting one's ability to promote sleep. In addition, and the ease of promoting sleep and sleep promotion being a part of the unit routine were labelled as facilitators by ward nurses and barriers by CSICU nurses. Conclusion/Implications for Practice: Multiple barriers and facilitators influence cardiac nurses' use of sleep promotion practices. These findings can be used to inform the development of interventions to promote nurses' use of sleep promotion practices for this population, to improve the quality of inpatients' sleep, and promote recovery.Copyright © 2020

AB  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances were reported in 36% of hospitalized patients. While sleep-aids could increase delirium, there is some evidence of non-pharmacological interventions with ear plugs, eye masks and provision of quiet times in promoting sleep in patients in the intensive care unit. However, literature on whether those methods could improve patients' sleep in a general medical ward is limited. Method(s): This is a non-randomized single center pilot study. We recruited consecutive patients who were admitted to general medical floor in a community hospital. Exclusion criteria include altered mental status, dementia, non-English speakers. Pre-intervention group was recruited in the first month and intervention group was recruited in the subsequent month. All patients in the intervention group were given ear plugs and eye masks, given verbal instruction on how to use them. They were also informed on routine blood draw and vital sign check time range and were provided quiet time from 4pm to 5pm and 10 PM to 5AM. All patients were given survey with insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaire on discharge. Primary outcome is the percentage of patients with insomnia at the time of discharge. Results Out of 350 screened patients, there were a total of 106 recruited patients in the pre-intervention group and 109 recruited patients in the intervention group who we were able to obtain survey on discharge. Demographic characteristics (age, sex) were not different between the two groups. 49.1% patients in the pre-intervention group and 42.2% patients in the intervention group were found to have insomnia (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.44-1.30, p=0.31). After adjusted for age, history of insomnia, use of sedatives, adjusted odds ratio was 0.8 (95% CI 0.34-1.87, p 0.61). Mean ISI score were 7.54 +/- 6.17 in the intervention group and 8.1 +/- 6.71 in the pre-intervention group (p=0.17). Moderate and severe insomnia presented in 14.7% patients in the intervention group and 18% of patients in the pre-intervention group (p= 0.42). Satisfaction score (4.22 +/- 1.08 vs 4.36 +/- 0.86, p>0.05) and duration of stay (5.14 +/- 6.75 vs 5.47 +/- 6.08, p>0.05) did not have a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Interventions to reduce noise, light and providing quiet time in general medical wards did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in self-reported insomnia, as well as patients' satisfaction score and length of stay. Nevertheless, there was a trend toward numerically improvements in those 3 categories.

AB  - Video-fluoroscopic analysis can provide important insights for the evaluation of outcome and functionality after total knee arthroplasty, allowing the in vivo assessment of tibiofemoral kinematics without soft tissue artefacts. To enable measurement of the knee throughout activities of daily living such as gait, robotic systems like the moving fluoroscope have been developed that follow the knee movement and maintain the joint in front of the image intensifier. Since it is unclear whether walking while being accompanied by moving fluoroscope affects normal gait, the objective of this study was to investigate its influence on gait characteristics in healthy subjects. In addition, the impact of the motors' noise was analysed. By means of skin markers analysis (VICON MX system, Oxford Metrics Group, UK) and simultaneous measurement of ground reaction forces (Kistler force plates, Kistler, Switzerland), gait characteristics when walking with and without the moving fluoroscope as well as with and without ear protectors in combination with the moving fluoroscope, were obtained in young (n = 10, 24.5y +/- 3.0y) and elderly (n = 9, 61.6y +/- 5.3y) subjects during level gait and stair descent. Walking with the moving fluoroscope significantly decreased gait velocity in level gait and stair descent over the respective movement without the fluoroscope. Statistical analysis, including gait velocity as a covariate, resulted in no differences on the ground reaction force parameters. However, some kinematic parameters (ankle, knee and hip ranges of motion, minimal knee angle in late stance phase, maximal knee angles in stance and swing phase) seemed to be modified by the presence of the moving fluoroscope, but statistical comparison was limited due to velocity differences between the conditions. Wearing ear protectors to avoid the influence of motor sound during walking with the moving fluoroscope caused no significant difference. Walking with the moving fluoroscope has been shown to decrease gait velocity and small alterations in kinematic parameters were observed. Therefore, gait and movement alterations due to the moving fluoroscope cannot completely be excluded. However, based on the absence of differences in ground reaction force parameters (when adjusted for velocity within ANCOVA), as well as based on the comparable shape of the angular curves to the slow control condition, it can be concluded that changes in gait when walking with the moving fluoroscope are small, especially in comparison to natural slow walking. In order to allow assessment of joint replacement with the moving fluoroscope, including an understanding of the effects of joint pain, clinical analyses can only be compared to gait activities showing similarly reduced velocities. Importantly, the reduced gait speeds observed in this study are similar to those observed after total knee arthroplasty, suggesting that analyses in such subjects are appropriate. However, the moving fluoroscope would likely need to be optimized in order to detect natural gait characteristics at the higher gait velocities of healthy young subjects. The moving fluoroscope can be applied for comparisons between groups measured with the moving fluoroscope, but care should be taken when comparing data to subjects walking at self-selected speed without the moving fluoroscope.Copyright © 2018 Hitz et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of bilateral bone conduction amplification in patients with bilateral conductive hearing loss is unclear because cranial attenuation is usually considered negligible, and both cochleae can be stimulated with similar efficacy by each device. The aim of the study was to determine if bilateral bone-conduction hearing aids can improve hearing in noise in a homogeneous group of normal-hearing subjects with bilateral pseudo-conductive hearing loss. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, comparative. SETTING: Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders in University of Haifa, Israel. SUBJECTS: Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders in University of Haifa, Israel. INTERVENTIONS: Induction of bilateral pseudo-conductive hearing loss of more than 35 dB using earplugs and earmuffs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing quality on blinded comparison of unilateral versus bilateral amplification with bone-conduction hearing aids under different locations of noise. RESULT(S): Unilateral and bilateral amplification had similar efficacy when both signal and noise were presented from the front. However, bilateral amplification was significantly better when signals were presented from the front and noise was presented from both sides (SNR -10: 92% vs. 84%, p = 0.001; SNR -15: 84% vs. 78%, p = 0.005). Analysis of subject responses on blinded questionnaires revealed that 81% found hearing easier with bilateral amplification. Noise was reported to be more disturbing with unilateral amplification by 55% of the subjects and with bilateral amplification, by 9%. CONCLUSION(S): Bilateral amplification with bone conduction devices can improve understanding in noise in the binaural squelch setting. Subjective improvements with bilateral bone-conduction aids included better sound quality and reduced noise disturbance. These findings are consistent with the binaural mechanism of spectral release from masking.

AB  - In this review the indications for surgery are discussed, based on the literature and own publications. In 185 ears of children up to 14 years, 9.1% recurrent perforations were found. Ostitis of the ossicles is rarer than in adults and in cholesteatoma in children. Tubal function seems to influence the results. These factors are discussed. Surgery is indicated to improve and to prevent ossicular destruction; furthermore, the children are able to participate in swimming and sports without ear protection. Delay of tympanoplasty is recommended if bad cooperation makes pre- and postoperative treatment difficult, and in cases where a secretory otitis media on the contralateral ear indicates poor tubal function. A persisting perforation after extrusion of a grommet should not be closed immediately.

AB  - Until recently, most hearing conservation programs, including those in the military, have used permanent shifts in the pure-tone audiometric threshold as the gold standard for measuring hearing impairment in noise-exposed populations. However, recent results from animal studies suggest that high-level noise exposures can cause the permanent destruction of synapses between the inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers, even in cases where pure-tone audiometric thresholds eventually return to their normal pre-exposure baselines. This has created a dilemma for researchers, who are now increasingly interested in studying the long-term effects that temporary hearing shifts might have on hearing function, but are also concerned about the ethical considerations of exposing human listeners to high levels of noise for research purposes. One method that remains viable to study the effects of high noise exposures on human listeners, or to evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent noise-related inner ear damage, is to identify individuals in occupations with unavoidable noise exposures and measure hearing before and as soon as possible after exposure. This paper discusses some of the important factors to be considered in studies that attempt to measure acute hearing changes in noise-exposed military populations.

AB  - Cognitive and neurobehavioral problems are among the most severe adverse outcomes in very preterm infants. Such neurodevelopmental impairments may be mitigated through nonpharmacological interventions such as creative music therapy (CMT), an interactive, resource- and needs-oriented approach that provides individual social contact and musical stimulation. The aim was to test the feasibility of a study investigating the role of CMT and to measure the short- and medium-term effects of CMT on structural and functional brain connectivity with MRI. In this randomized, controlled clinical pilot feasibility trial, 82 infants were randomized to either CMT or standard care. A specially trained music therapist provided CMT via infant-directed humming and singing in lullaby style. To test the short-term effects of CMT on brain structure and function, diffusion tensor imaging data and resting-state functional imaging data were acquired. Clinical feasibility was achieved despite moderate parental refusal mainly in the control group after randomization. 40 infants remained as final cohort for the MRI analysis. Structural brain connectivity appears to be moderately affected by CMT, structural connectomic analysis revealed increased integration in the posterior cingulate cortex only. Lagged resting-state MRI analysis showed lower thalamocortical processing delay, stronger functional networks, and higher functional integration in predominantly left prefrontal, supplementary motor, and inferior temporal brain regions in infants treated with CMT. This trial provides unique evidence that CMT has beneficial effects on functional brain activity and connectivity in networks underlying higher-order cognitive, socio-emotional, and motor functions in preterm infants. Our results indicate the potential of CMT to improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born very preterm.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Introduction: The children of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from various complications. Auditory hypersensitivity (AH) is one of them. The mechanism is not clear and effective treatments are not found. Some reports suggest that AH is caused by decreased inhibitory processing resulting from abnormal sensory gating system or dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons, and the abnormalities in the GABAergic interneurons and/or in the serotonin/dopamine system. We report here our experience to treat AH in ASD children by a small dose of valproic acid (VPA). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of seven children (two males, M: 1 and 2? and five females, F, 1-5) of ASD with severe AH from the age of 5 to 11 years. They were suffered from noises of vacuum cleaner, noises at platform, echo in a pool, siren of ambulance etc. Six cases took Yokukansan (Japanese herbal medicine with serotonergic functions) at first, as emotional stabilizer, but not effective for AH. F-2 took VPA as the initial treatment for AH. VPA was used with the dose of 5.1 to 8.3 mg/kg/day. Result(s): In all cases, AH phenomena became milder (F-3,-4,-5) or disappeared (F-1,-2, M1,2). F-1 who suffered from various noises, especially sound to wash out in a lavatory became free from earmuffs, the monthly panic in F-2 triggered by a chime of microwave oven, sound of boiled water, etc., disappeared within a month. Conclusion(s): The treatment by small dose of VPA for AH in ASD showed successful effects, This treatment has a value to be tried.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the hearing protection practice of Chinese workers and the value of hearing protection fit testing. DESIGN: The Field Attenuation Estimation System (FAES) was used to measure the personal attenuation ratings (PARs) of one foam earplug used at the work sites in China. Intervention was provided to workers who needed it. Follow-up fit testing was conducted approximately six months later. Paired t-tests were conducted to compare the baseline, post-intervention and follow-up visit PARs. STUDY SAMPLE: Fit testing was conducted on 335 workers in four factories with 269 workers intervened. Follow-up visit was conducted on 97 intervened workers in three factories. RESULT(S): The mean PAR baseline was 10 dB. Significant improvement was shown on post-intervention PARs (p < 0.05) as well as follow-up visit PARs (p < 0.05). Comparing follow-up visit PARs to post-intervention PARs, good sustainability was shown in two factories (p > 0.05), while a significant decline (p < 0.05) was observed in another. CONCLUSION(S): Hearing protection fit testing demonstrated value for verifying sufficiency of attenuation. The training along with fit testing contributed to improve PARs and maintaining effectiveness over time. Employer's attention and follow-up actions are important in sustaining the training effectiveness.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the field efficacy of an earmuff used by the employees of a private company. METHOD(S): Measurements were performed using a double-channel noise dosimeter. Noise levels collected in one-third-octave bands were corrected with the frequency response for diffuse sound field and attenuation was compared with values provided by the manufacturer of the hearing protection device (HPD). RESULT(S): Comparisons between the corrected noise reduction and the attenuation provided by the manufacturer of the HPD show no statistically significant differences in attenuation for most frequency bands, with higher mean values for the observed corrected noise reduction. However, despite the fact that the field attenuation values are above those obtained in the laboratory, when individual attenuation values were compared with expected attenuation values it was found that the employees have below-expected noise attenuation in all frequency bands. CONCLUSION(S): The fact that over 60% of the employees had frequency band attenuations below that expected for most frequency bands underscores the need for individual assessment of attenuation provided by the HPD in the workplace, to assess whether the HPD is functional and what provisions should be implemented in a specific workplace.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at analyzing the effect of music on pain and anxiety felt by women in labor during their first pregnancy., METHOD: When the pregnant women in the experimental group progressed into the active phase of the labor, they were made to listen to music in Acemasiran mode with earplugs for 3h (20min of listening with 10-min breaks)., FINDINGS: It was observed that after the first-hour women indicated that their pain was statistically less in the experimental group. Trait anxiety scores of the women in labor were similar for experimental and control groups. Following the practice, state anxiety average scores became lower in favor of the experimental group and the correlation was statistically significant., CONCLUSION: In order to facilitate women's coping with labor pain and improve their wellbeing with the activity during the labor, musicotherapy, a non-pharmacological method, is an effective, simple and economical method.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to determine if noise-canceling headphones (NCHs) with music supersedes pain reduction of other hearing protection for patients transported by Guardian Air Transport via rotor or fixed wing aircraft from 2017 to 2019. Method(s): We designed a randomized pilot study in which patients who received NCHs with or without music were compared with controls who received non-NCH hearing protection alone. Four hundred fifty-four adults 19 to 64 years of age and 36 pediatric patients 4 to 18 years old who received >= 1 dose of opioids were included. Result(s): In the aggregate population, opioid use was reduced by 31% from 14.3 to 10.0 morphine milligram equivalent/h transport (P =.131) with music compared with controls. The mean total pain reduction in the aggregate population from -2.5 (standard deviation [SD] = 3.2) to -4.0 (SD = 2.9) was 1.6-fold more than controls compared with NCH and music (P =.008). This effect was most profound in the pediatric population where the mean total pain reduction with NCHs and music (-5.4, SD = 3.1) was 3.4-fold more than controls (-1.6, SD = 2.7, P =.021). Conclusion(s): Music may provide greater subjective pain relief when combined with NCHs in the air transport environment; further research is required.Copyright © 2020 Air Medical Journal Associates

AB  - Hazards associated with grain storage facilities are a contributing factor to agricultural injuries and are a perpetual problem for Ohio farmers, especially as on-farm grain storage facilities continue to grow in popularity with producers. To establish effective injury prevention programs, safety professionals must first understand how the industry operates, the culture of the workers, and the current practices used to avoid injuries. This research project was designed to bridge the gap between what is currently known about the hazards that exist on Ohio's farms, specifically how safety and health information is incorporated at the grain handling and storage facilities. Using a four-part survey, 182 cash grain operators, comprising a convenience sample of farmers attending educational events, were surveyed to determine the type of grain storage and handling facilities used on their farms, the occurrence of out-of-condition grain, and the health and safety factors practiced at these facilities, including their knowledge about potential hazards. Results indicated that the farmers preferred to get safety knowledge from a course or seminar (53.6%) or by reading a magazine or periodical (38.8%). The surveyed farmers indicated that they had higher knowledge of the safety risks of out-of-condition grain than of the health effects from exposure to out-of-condition grain (p < 0.01). They identified personal protective equipment (PPE) as their primary measure to prevent injuries, with the top PPE items being respirators, safety glasses, hearing protection, and gloves. Farmers who encountered out-of-condition grain reported more employees on their farms compared to the other farmers in the sample and reported higher use of PPE. While these results cannot be generalized to Ohio's entire population of cash grain farmers, they provide a good understanding of the on-farm grain storage and management practices, which will allow a more targeted intervention plan, both in better engineering controls and in future outreach programs.Copyright© by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

AB  - Introduction Hearing loss and tinnitus are common in most populations, although few data have addressed hearing-related health among tribal members and the need for public health interventions. Methods This cross-sectional study examined prevalence and risk factors for hearing loss and tinnitus among 217 adults in a Pacific Northwest tribe. Frequency measures were conducted for difficulty hearing certain sounds and hearing aid use. In 2006, risk factors were examined for two outcomes-hearing loss and tinnitus-with analysis conducted in the same year. Results Although self-reported hearing loss was more common in men (24%) than women (13%), a larger percentage of women compared with men reported difficulty hearing certain sounds. Only 8% of study participants reported hearing aid use. After age adjustment, significant noise exposure was associated with hearing loss (OR=8.30, 95% CI=1.84, 37.52). The overall prevalence of tinnitus was 33% (similar in men and women). After adjusting for age, the odds of tinnitus in individuals with more than four ear infections was 4.77 (95% CI=1.89, 12.02) times the odds in those who never had an ear infection. Tinnitus was also associated with significant noise exposure (OR=2.24, 95% CI=1.28, 6.73) even after age adjustment. Conclusions Increasing age and significant noise exposure were associated with hearing loss in this tribe. Tinnitus was associated with significant noise exposure and history of otitis media, even after age adjustment. Public health efforts are needed to improve hearing-related health in this tribe through messages about noise exposure and use of hearing protection.Copyright © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB  - AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of a Video Eyeglasses/Earphones System (VEES) as distracting device in reducing anxiety in children during dental procedures carried out under local anaesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this crossover clinical trial, 36 Frankl scale II and III children aged 5-8 years received different dental procedures in two sessions, with and without the VEES system. In the control visit, they were not exposed to this distraction stimulus, but traditional non-aversive behaviour management was applied. Each dental session was divided into four phases (explanation, anaesthetic injection, rubber-dam/clamp placement, and high-speed hand piece work for 5 min). Pain in each treatment phase was assessed by the following measurements: the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale. Pulse rate, and oxygen saturation measurements were employed to evaluate the state of anxiety. Comparison of the outcomes of two interventions were statistically analysed through the Wilcoxon Signed-rank Test. RESULT(S): There were no statistical differences between the results of the two interventions (VEES vs. no VEES/behavioural management) during the four treatment phases on assessment by any of the measurements employed. CONCLUSION(S): The VEES method was not more effective than traditional non-aversive behavioural techniques for reducing anxiety and pain perception in children undergoing dental treatment.

AB  - Objectives: (1) Characterize the different types of otologic symptoms in frontline staff with prolonged powered airpurifying respirator (PAPR) use. (2) Quantify changes in hearing thresholds as determined by audiometry in frontline staff with prolonged PAPR use. (3) Evaluate the effect of aural protection on both symptom persistence and reversal of audiometric threshold shifts. Method(s): This is a prospective study of hearing loss in hospital staff wearing PAPR, occurring from May 2020 to June 2020. Subjects underwent audiograms, as well as an otologic exam to detail their symptoms, time wearing PAPR, and use of ear plugs. Outcome measures were hearing changes on audiogram and symptoms of tinnitus, increased hearing difficulty, or aural fullness. Result(s): Eight staff members with PAPR exposure underwent a standard audiometric evaluation. Tinnitus was reported by 6 staff members, aural fullness by 4, and temporary hearing loss by 3. PAPR noise levels measured inside and outside the hood were 87 dB HL and 78 dB HL, respectively. The longest continuous use was 5 hours and the longest cumulative daily use was 10 hours. Three staff had evidence of mild sensorineural noise notch or hearing loss. Afterwards, staff members were counseled to reduce length of PAPR use and commence ear plug use. Decreased symptoms and improvement in hearing were noted on repeat evaluation. Conclusion(s): Extended PAPR use without aural protection may be associated with the development of tinnitus and possibly temporary threshold shifts. Health care professionals should be counseled appropriately for the duration of the pandemic to prevent permanent hearing loss.

AB  - Objectives: Noise-induced hearing loss from firearm use is a major cause of hearing disability in the military. According to the Census for the Bureau, the prevalence of severe hearing impairment among veterans was 10.4% in 2010. Hearing protection devices such as earplugs are the primary means of military hearing protection, but they can hinder communication during training/combat. Firearm suppressors (silencers) are capable of reducing 20-35 dB impulse. Despite this benefit, they are rarely used because of purchase restrictions. Advocates urge to ease restrictions, arguing that it will preserve hearing. Critics argue that it would allow criminal use. However, the benefits of silencers within the military outweigh any possibilities of misuse. We investigate whether silencers could supplement/replace earplugs in the military. Method(s): We performed a literature search using 5 databases from 1995 through December 2017 following guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Result(s): The literature shows that silencers offered 50% more noise reduction than earplugs alone. Earplugs are unable to reduce the impulse sound level of common firearms (140 dB). Silencers are able to reduce levels to 140 dB or less in certain weapons. Conclusion(s): Compared with earplugs alone, silencers offer superior noise reduction when combined with earplugs. Silencers also offer tactical benefits allowing communication during training/missions. In the military, silencers can reduce hearing impairment, promoting military readiness and decreasing hearing impairment disability compensation.

AB  - Dentists' workplace require various biohazard safety measures, including those related to noise exposure, for many of their equipment produce intense noise and, in addition, are positioned close to the professional's ears. This exposure may cause irreversible High Sound Pressure Noise Induced Hearing Loss, with progression liable on both time of exposure to noise and no use of hearing protection. This study, without human participation, approved by the CAPI of Unoeste under the ID 3063, aimed to analyse the sound pressure levels produced by high rotation pens. Two types of pen, composed by different metals and alloys, were evaluated using Digital Minipa MSL-1325 Decibelimeter. Measuring was developed in two different contexts: in a silent workplace or amongst other active equipment, in various materials (teeth, resin, metal and porcelain). Both pens produced higher sound pressure levels than referred in their instruction booklets. The medium of values when in silence, without contact to materials as porcelain, teeth, resin and metal was 79, 73 dB (A) for pen no1 and 77, 77 dB (A) for pen no2. With other equipment were active as well, values rose to 87,8 dB (A) and 80,7 dB (A), respectively, no1 and no2. When referred materials were involved, values surpassed the level preconized by law for an eight-hour daily working shift, that of 85dB NPS. In conclusion, the older technology pen, in aluminium (pen no2), showed itself less noisy and kept a more steady sound level in the different materials evaluated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this fit-testing study in the field was to systematically compare three Hearing Protection Device (HPD) fit-training methods and determine whether they differ in the acquisition of HPD fitting skill and resulting amount of earplug attenuation. DESIGN: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive HPD fit-training using one of three training methods: current, experiential HPD (eHPD), and integrated. Personal Attenuation Ratings (PARs) were acquired via HPD fit-testing and used to verify attenuations pre- and post-training. STUDY SAMPLE: US Marine training recruits (n=341) identified via HPD fit-testing for remedial HPD fit-training and assigned to three cohorts. RESULT(S): The post-training HPD fit-test passing rate differed by training method, with pass rates ranging from 50% (current) to nearly 92% (eHPD). The difference between group delta PAR values were significantly higher (>9dB) in both the eHPD and integrated methods compared to the current method. CONCLUSION(S): The HPD fit-training methods that teach "what right feels like" (eHPD and integrated) provided a greater number of trainees with the skill to achieve noise attenuation values required for impulse noise exposures encountered during basic training. The attenuation achieved by those methods was significantly greater than the current training method.

AB  - Introduction: Hearing loss affects people's quality of life. If we consider that hearing loss is the triggering factor, the positive correlation with tinnitus can be justified, since damage or degeneration of the inner ear and the vestibulocochlear nerve can be the cause of tinnitus. Objective(s): To evaluate the impact on the quality of life of people with ages 40 to 60 years who present tinnitus. Evaluate if there is a higher prevalence in relation to gender. Method(s): This is an individual, analytical, observational, cross-sectional, uncontrolled study. The study was carried out in the city of Pouso Alegre, MG, at the Samuel Libanio Clinical Hospital, in the 40-60 age group. Made with 93 people randomly selected. An anamnesis was made and sent to the otology and a threshold tonal audiometry. The data were organized and tabulated in the Microsoft Excel 2013 program and analyzed using the SPSS 18 software. Result(s): The Chi-square test, shows that there was statistical significance in the variables alcoholic beverage (p = 0.016) and chronic disease (p = 0.021). It was possible to correlate the tinnitus symptom and hearing loss in workers from noisy places who did not use or used ear protectors. Conclusion(s): It is concluded that the tinnitus symptom, when comparing the variables gender with the use of alcoholic beverage with the presence of chronic diseases, is more prevalent. The use of the ear protector in noisy environments is associated with complaints of hearing loss and tinnitus.

AB  - Hospital workers are exposed to many occupational hazards that may threaten their health and safety. Physical hazards encountered in hospital working environment include temperature, illumination, noise, electrical injuries, and radiation. To assess the awareness of healthcare workers (HCWs) about physical hazards in Tanta university hospitals, this cross-sectional study included 401 HCWs (physicians, nurses, technicians, and workers) from seven departments (general surgery, orthopedics, radiology, ophthalmology, kitchen, incinerator, and laundry). Data were collected through interview questionnaire to assess six types of physical hazards (noise, electric hazards, temperature, radiation, fire, and lighting,). Most of the physicians (63.7%) were aware of the level of noise. All physicians, nurses, technicians, and majority of workers reported that hearing protective devices were not available, and all HCWs reported that periodic hearing examination was not performed. Most of the nurses (75.2%) and workers (68.5%) did not attended emergency training, and more than two thirds of all HCWs were not briefed about emergency evacuation. Most HCWs were not given appropriate radiation safety training before starting work (88% of workers, 73.7% of nurses, 65.7% of physicians, and 68.3% of technicians). The majority of physicians, nurses, and technicians (70.5, 65.4, and 53.7%) denied regular environmental monitoring for radiation level inside work place. Health education programs on health and safety issues regarding physical hazards should be mandatory to all healthcare workers to improve their awareness and protect them from undue exposures they may face due to lack of adequate awareness and knowledge. There is urgent need of expanding the occupational healthcare services in Egypt to cover all the employees as indicated by the international recommendations and the Egyptian Constitution, legislation, and community necessity.

AB  - Tens of millions of U.S. residents have a range of adverse health outcomes caused by noise exposure (1). During 2011-2012, 21 million U.S. adults who reported no exposure to loud or very loud noise at work exhibited hearing damage suggestive of noise-induced hearing loss (2). In addition to the known risk for hearing damage, nonauditory adverse health outcomes and health risks from excessive environmental sound exposure can include effects on the cardiovascular system, metabolism, blood pressure, body weight, cognition, sleep, mental health, quality of life, and overall well-being (1,3,4). CDC analyzed a representative sample of the U.S. adult population (aged >=18 years) from a 2018 national marketing survey (50 states and the District of Columbia) that included questions about use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) (e.g., ear plugs or ear muffs) during recreational exposure to loud athletic and entertainment events; approximately 8% of respondents reported consistent use of an HPD at these types of events. Among those adults more likely to wear an HPD, 63.8% had at least some college education, and 49.1% had higher income levels. Women and older adults were significantly less likely to use HPDs. These findings suggest a need to strengthen a public health focus on the adverse health effects of excessive noise exposure at home and in recreational settings as well as a need for continued efforts to raise public awareness about the protective value of HPDs.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss associated with the workplace has been well described. Far less is known, however, about the risks to hearing from recreational sources of noise. We investigated the popular sport of stock car racing as a potentially significant source of noise exposure, and we conducted a sound-level survey at a National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) event. Noise levels measured during the race ranged from 96.5 to 104 dB(A) at 46 meters (~150 feet) from the track and 99 to 109 dB (A) at 6 meters (~20 feet) from the track. The peak sound pressure level at 6 meters was 109 dB(A). Although significantly less than that associated with an immediate permanent threshold shift, such an exposure could cause a temporary threshold shift. Alhough hearing protection is recommended, particularly for track employees with longer periods of exposure, racing fans with only occasional exposure to such noise levels are unlikely to develop a permanent noise-induced hearing loss. © 2009, Vendome Group, LLC.

AB  - Hearing conservation programs (HCPs) mandated by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cost about $350/worker/year. Are they cost-effective? A cross-sectional model of the US adult population with and without HCPs incorporates (1) the American Medical Association's method for estimating binaural hearing impairment and whole-person impairment; (2) the model of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for estimating both age-related and noise-induced hearing loss; and (3) an acceptable cost of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. The ISO model's outputs were audiometric thresholds for groups of people with different age, sex, and noise exposure history. These thresholds were used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life year saved for people in HCPs with different noise exposure levels. Model simulations suggest that HCPs may be cost-effective only when time-weighted average (TWA) noise exposures are >= 90 dBA. Enforcing existing regulations, requiring engineering noise control at high exposure levels, and using new methods that can document hearing protection device performance could improve cost-effectiveness. If the OSHA action level remains at 85 dBA-TWA, reducing the permissible exposure limit to the same level would simplify management and slightly improve cost-effectiveness. Research should evaluate employer compliance across industries, determine whether workers currently excluded from HCP regulations are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss, and develop cost-effective HCPs for mobile workers in construction, agriculture, and oil and gas drilling and servicing. Research on HCP cost-effectiveness could be extended to incorporate sensitivity analyses of the effects of a wider range of assumptions.

AB  - Context: Young people expose themselves to high noise levels during leisure activities, and might thus be at risk of acquiring hearing-related problems. Therefore, information regarding risk-taking behavior is necessary to prevent future hearing problems and to optimize future preventive campaigns. Aim(s): This study evaluated the test-retest reliability of the Youth Attitude to Noise Scale (YANS) and beliefs about hearing protection and hearing loss (BAHPHL) instrument. Settings and Design: Forty-three young adults between 18 and 29 years filled in a questionnaire at two test moments. Material(s) and Method(s): The YANS and BAHPHL instrument were used to evaluate the attitudes toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protection. Each participant completed the retest within 21-55 days after the first administration of the questionnaire. Result(s): Paired Student's t-tests showed no significant differences in mean scores between test and retest for both the entire YANS and BAHPHL instrument as well as their factors. Furthermore, a good agreement between test and retest scores was seen by Bland-Altman analyses. Intraclass correlation coefficients were above 0.70 for the entire YANS and the factor related to youth culture as well as for the entire BAHPHL and all the factors of the BAHPHL instrument, except for the factor related to the severity of the consequences of hearing loss. Conclusion(s): Reliable test-retest measurements of the YANS and BAHPHL instrument can be performed. Hence, these questionnaires can be used in longitudinal studies to explore young adults' changes in attitudes toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protection, with or without an educational intervention.

AB  - Recently, the importance of the ICU environment as a potential modifiable factor for improvement of patient care has become more clear. In this review, we describe the effects of light and noise exposure on ICU patients. In ICU patients circadian rhythms and sleep are severely disturbed, which may increase the risk of delirium. Realignment of circadian rhythmicity by means of artificial light therapy has not been shown to reduce the incidence or duration of delirium. Prudent use of nighttime light may be a first step in improvement of patient sleep. Eye masks appear to improve sleep although they are only applicable for a selected group of patients. Noise levels in the ICU are above recommended standards. Negative effects include disturbances of sleep, as often encountered in ICU patients. Staff activity and talking contribute substantially to the total acoustic energy, providing opportunities to adapt behaviour and/or workflow in order to reduce noise pollution.Copyright © 2019, Netherlands Society of Intensive Care.

AB  - This study explored the effects of sound loudness on human nervous system from four aspects: regional spontaneous brain activity, cognition performance, sympathovagal balance of the autonomic nervous system and subjective feelings. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrocardiogram were measured in 12 volunteered students under three noise conditions. Mental performance, fatigue, noise sensation, annoyance and subjective distraction were also investigated. Earplugs were found invalid to improve annoyance and distraction in a common office condition (45 dB(A)), although noisy feeling was alleviated. Possible under-stimulated effects were observed with enhanced stress according to functional magnetic resonance and heart rate variability results. Annoyance, distraction, heart rate and heart rate variability increased significantly in a louder noise condition (65 dB(A)). Correlation analysis shows that heart rate is significantly correlated with either noise sensation, annoyance or distraction while heart rate variability presents significant correlations only with annoyance. Mental performance of calculation and reaction is moderately correlated with annoyance, while no significant differences of performance were observed between the three noise conditions. Constant office work with noise exposure will cause changes in the limbic gyrus and adherent regions. Parahippocampal gyrus is the only region with significantly different brain activity in three noise conditions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - One company that has a risk of hearing loss is PT. X engaged in the supply, processing and distribution of steel and ready-mixed materials for construction, electricity, mining, telecommunication and transportation industries. Location of noise intensity there are 4 parts that is part of iron pole, elbow, pipe and work shop. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of individual characteristics and noise intensity with subjective hearing loss to workers in PT. X..The type of this research is analytic research with cross sectional design. Population in this study are all workers in unit production of PT. X as many as 157 people with a sample of 61 people. The sampling technique is simple random sampling. The study was conducted in January -October. The data were analyzed univariate using frequency and bivariate distribution using Chi-Square statistical test with significance level 95% alpha = 0,05. The results showed less than half (49.2% of respondents subjected to subjective hearing loss. Less than half (39.3%) of respondents were at risk. More than half (68.9%) of respondents have long worked. More than half (68.9%) had less intensity than NAB (<85 dB). More than half (60.7%) of respondents did not use ear protective equipment. There is a significant relationship of age, length of service, noise intensity, ear protection with subjective hearing loss in PT. X .It is expected that the company minimizes noise intensity by using silencers. The sound-proofing device can use the barrier wall between the machine and the worker or the silencer can be mounted on the sound source on the machine and it is expected that the company provides clear rules with sanctions for workers who do not use ear protection.Copyright © 2020, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Celebrate Safe approach is a collaboration between public health organisations and music event/venue organisers to encourage health promotion interventions in nightlife settings and at music events. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Celebrate Safe approach with regard to its impact on use of ear plugs among visitors of music events. DESIGN: A pre-registered cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted at music events throughout the Netherlands (k=15). In the experimental condition, event organisers were asked to share an online pre-event message about ear plugs, clearly indicate where visitors could buy ear plugs, and sell ear plugs at busy locations on the premises. Visitors were encouraged to wear ear plugs by means of an 'ear check' at the beginning of the event.Study sample: Observations to assess whether event visitors wear ear plugs (N=3836). RESULT(S): A multilevel model, taking into account nesting of visitors within events, revealed that use of ear plugs at music events in the experimental condition was higher in comparison to events in the control condition (23% vs. 14%, OR = 1.9, 95%CI 1.2-3.0, p=0.004). CONCLUSION(S): The Celebrate Safe approach has a positive impact on use of ear plugs among visitors of music events.

AB  - Background: Recently, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)-based resting state (RS) functional connectivity features have identified distinct biotypes in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that may predict treatment efficacy. However, there are practical barriers for the clinical implementation of fMRI biomarkers. The neurochemical underpinnings of RS connectivity features are also incompletely understood. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an inexpensive, noninvasive technique to assess cortical physiology at the bedside. TMS indirectly measures GABAB receptor mediated tone via long interval cortical inhibition (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). In adolescents with MDD, deficits of LICI may be markers of treatment resistance and suicide risk. The purpose of this study was to pilot methodology focused on examining associations with LICI and CSP and functional connectivity measures in adolescents with MDD. This work could inform common substrates for specific TMS and RS fMRI based biomarkers and provide opportunities for pragmatic biomarker development. Method(s): Six participants with MDD (mean age 16.7+1.7 years, 4 females) underwent MRI sessions and TMS testing (LICI and CSP). For MRI sessions, participants were instructed to keep their eyes open and focus on a spot, and their respiration and cardiac pulse were also recorded. T1 anatomy (MPRAGE, TR/TE = 7.37/3.04ms, inversion time = 900ms, flip angle = 8degree, voxel size= 1 x 1 x 1.2mm3) and RS fMRI (GE EPI, 3.3mm isocubic voxel size, 48 slices, total acquisition time = 448 s, TR/TE = 2900/30ms, flip angle = 90degree) data were collected using a GE 3 Tesla scanner equipped with 8-ch head-coil array. All imaging data were aligned with the N27 brain template and RS fMRI data were preprocessed with ANATICOR and PESTICA. For each participant, a connectivity matrix was obtained from correlations between timeseries separately averaged within FreeSurfer's regions of interest (ROIs), and standardized via Fisher transformation. During concurrent CSP and LICI testing sessions, participants wore earplugs and were seated comfortably. Motor evoked potential (MEP) data were collected with surface electromyography. Participants were instructed to maintain muscle relaxation, which was monitored with audio feedback. The TMS coil was placed tangentially the participant's head at a 45-degree angle over the motor hotspot. Cortical silent period measures were collected during muscle contraction at 20% of the participant's maximum with a TMS pulse intensity 140% motor threshold. LICI measures were collected with interstimulus intervals of 100 ms, 150 ms, and 200 ms. Correlation coefficients between connectivity matrices and LICI/CSP scores were generated for each participant and their statistical significance was corrected by false discovery rate control (FDR q<0.05). Result(s): Means (SD) of cortical inhibition measures in this sample reflected prior reports of cortical inhibition in adolescents with MDD: LICI 100= 0.142 (0.086); LICI 150 =0.238 (0.141), LICI 200 =0.406 (0.42), CSp =0.158 (0.022). Heat maps demonstrated correlations between connectivity patterns and LICI 100, LICI 150, LIC 200, and CSP. Generally, impaired cortical inhibition as determined by higher LICI values was associated with an increased number of strong correlations with connectivity patterns. Notably, LICI 200 demonstrated the largest number of correlations and the strongest correlations as compared to the other measures tested. For LICI 200, the left lingual gyrus had the highest number of correlated connectivity patterns. The number of correlated connectivity patterns was greatest for LICI 100, LICI 150, and CSP in the right precentral gyrus, left declive, and left declive, respectively. Conclusion(s): These correlations between deficits in LICI and discrete RS connectivity features demonstrate that concurrent measurement of GABAergic neurotransmission and RS functional connectivity may have utility in biomarker studies of adolescent MDD. Although the small sample size is a limitation in the int rpretation of these preliminary results, these data suggest the feasibility and utility of this approach. RS studies may further validate TMS measures of cortical inhibition such as LICI and CSP, enhancing our understanding of the neurochemical substrate for functional connectivity. An efficient and accessible proxy for RS studies would have great utility in future clinical research and practice.

AB  - Background: Hearing protection devices (HPDs) are often used in the workplace to prevent hearing damage caused by noise. However, a factor that can lead to hearing loss in the workplace is improper HPD fitting, and the previous literature has shown that instructing workers on how to properly insert their HPDs can make a significant difference in the degree of attenuation. Method(s): Two studies were completed on a total of 33 Hydro One workers. A FitCheck Solo field attenuation estimation system was used to measure the personal attenuation rating (PAR) before and after providing one-on-one fitting instructions. In addition, external ear canal diameters were measured, and a questionnaire with items related to frequency of use, confidence, and discomfort was administered. Result(s): Training led to an improvement in HPD attenuation, particularly for participants with poorer PARs before training. The questionnaire results indicated that much HPD discomfort is caused by heat, humidity, and communication difficulties. External ear canal asymmetry did not appear to significantly influence the measured PAR. Conclusion(s): In accordance with the previous literature, our studies suggest that one-on-one instruction is an effective training method for HPD use. Addressing discomfort issues from heat, humidity, and communication issues could help to improve the use of HPDs in the workplace. Further research into the effects of canal asymmetry on the PAR is needed.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effects of earplugs on acoustical and perceptual measures of choral and solo sound. Method(s): The researcher tested the effects of musician's earplugs on choral and solo timbre and singer perceptions. Members of an intact women's university choir recorded Dona Nobis Pacem under two conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs over time. Approximately half of the choir members also participated as soloists, recording Over the Rainbow under the same two conditions. All recordings were analyzed using long-term average spectra (LTAS). After participating in each recording session, the participants responded to a questionnaire about ability to hear self (solo and choral context) and ability to hear others (choral context) under two conditions, no earplugs and with earplugs. Result(s): LTAS results revealed that wearing earplugs in a choral setting caused decreased mean signal energy (>1 dB), resulting in less resonant singing. LTAS results also indicated that wearing earplugs in a solo setting had less effect on mean signal energy, resulting in a mean difference <1 dB in 3 of the 4 weeks studied. Singer questionnaire responses showed that wearing earplugs had a greater effect on participants' ability to hear others than it did on their ability to hear themselves. Conclusion(s): In the context of this study, it seems that wearing earplugs had more effect on timbre and the ability to receive sufficient auditory feedback in a choral setting than it did in a solo setting. Findings from this study could provide important information when structuring hearing conservation strategies.Copyright © 2019 The Voice Foundation

AB  - Objectives: To compare the effect of ear plug and music in reducing anxiety in patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia Design: A randomized, single-blind, prospective study Setting: Imam Reza Hospital, Kermanshah, Iran Subjects: Ninety pregnant women undergoing elective caesarian section using spinal anesthesia Intervention: The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: music group, ear plug group and control group, each including 30 individuals. Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate the individuals' anxiety before and after the intervention. SPSS version 20 was used to analyze the data. One-way analysis of variance, Chi square, and paired samples t-test were used to compare the data. Main outcome measure(s): Anxiety Results: There were significant differences between the mean scores of the STAI questionnaire in music (21.83 +/- 11.9 vs. 13 +/- 8.02) and control groups (24.4 +/- 11.89 vs. 16.6 +/- 8.14) pre and post-test (p = 0.001) but not in ear plug group (p = 0.327). There were significant differences between the mean scores of the STAI questionnaire in music (21.83 +/- 11.9 vs. 13 +/- 8.02) and control (24.4 +/- 11.89 vs. 16.6 +/- 8.14) groups pre and post-test (p = 0.001) in parity I group. For individuals with under diploma level of education, there were significant differences between the mean scores of the STAI questionnaire in music (21.23 +/- 11.78 vs. 13.55 +/- 8.17) and control (24.96 +/- 11.61 vs. 16.17 +/- 7.45) groups pre and post-test (p < 0.05). For individuals under 30 years of age, there were significant differences between the mean scores of the STAI questionnaire in music group pre (21.60 +/- 12.51) and post-test (13.30 +/- 7.66) (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Only music has effect on reducing anxiety in parity I group and those with under diploma level of education.Copyright © The Kuwait Medical Journal. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hearing-protection devices (HPDs) are particularly important in protecting the hearing of workers. The aim of this study was to prevent hearing damage in workplaces in Taiwan. It was conducted to determine the actual sound attenuation of the personal attenuation rating (PAR) values when wearing HPDs via measurements from field microphones in workers' real ears (F-MIRE). Across 105 measurement trials for the ClassicTM roll-down foam earplug HPDs worn by the workers, there were 23 cases of ineffective protection (including caution and fail); the proportion was 20% (including the first measurement and re-wear of HPDs after education and training). In addition, re-education and training in how to wear the HPDs was provided, improving wearing skills. A total of 29 testees wearing the ClassicTM roll-down foam earplug HPDs failed to meet the pass standard for the first PAR test, and 6 of them improved and subsequently passed the PAR test. The improvement rate was 20%. These 23 testees switched to another HPD, namely Kneading-Free Push-InsTM earplugs. From this group, 16 effective sound attenuation values were obtained, with an improvement rate of 70%. However, seven testees failed to pass the PAR test, and after education, training, and replacement of HPDs with different types, they still could not pass the PAR test. At that time, even if the UltraFitTM pre-molded earplugs were adopted again for wear and replacement, they were still unable to pass the PAR test. This HPD was eventually replaced with the PELTOR X4A Earmuff HPD and then tested again, with these HPDs finally passing the PAR test. In Taiwan, the use of fit testing has been increasing but it is not a common practice, and few studies on hearing-protection fit testing have been conducted in this country. The goal of this study was to gain more insight into the current hearing protection situation, including field attenuation of HPDs obtained by workers, the effects of training on improving the attenuation of HPDs after F-MIRE measurements, and the awareness of hearing health and motivation on the use of HPDs in a high-noise-level environment.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data on noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in the automotive industry are rare. This pilot study aimed to investigate the prevalence and determinants of NIHL among workers in the automotive industry in China. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 6557 participants from the automotive industry. The questionnaire survey was administered, and individual noise exposure level (LAeq.8h ) and hearing loss level were measured. RESULT(S): Of participants, 96.43% were male; the median age was 27.0 years and 28.82% had NIHL defined as adjusted high-frequency noise-induced hearing loss (AHFNIHL). Concerning individual noise levels (LAeq.8h ), 62.53% exceeded 85 dB(A), which were mainly concentrated in various jobs, including metal cutting, surface treatment, stamping, welding, grinding, assembly, plastic molding, and forging. Each typical noise source generated its own unique temporal waveform shape with the type of non-Gaussian noise. Of workers, 53.15% regularly used hearing protector devices (HPD), and the proportion of regular HPD use increased with LAeq.8h . The trend test showed that the prevalence of AHFNIHL in male workers significantly increased with an increase in LAeq.8h at <94 dB(A) and cumulative noise exposure (CNE) in each age group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). A logistic regression analysis showed that CNE and HPD usage frequency were important factors contributing to AHFNIHL. CONCLUSION(S): CNE and HPD usage frequency were the determinants for NIHL. Much more human surveys are needed to understand the prevalence and determinants of NIHL in the automotive industry in China.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Through the investigation of the injured persons in explosion accidents, the impact of wearing the ear protectors device (anti-noise earplugs) on the auditory organs and hearing loss of the injured person was understood, which could provide reference for the clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the explosive hearing impairment. Method(s): A retrospective survey was conducted on 39 directly injured persons who were injured in 23 explosion accidents involving a steel plant from 1990 to 2016 as the explosive hearing loss, taking the time of the patient's injury and 3-6 months after the injury as the time of investigation and evidence collection, and according to whether to wear the ear protectors device for group comparison and statistical analysis. Result(s): There was no significant difference between the two groups in hearing loss, tinnitus, earache, headache, some patients with dizziness and craniocerebral injury, regardless of whether the injured person wore anti-noise earplugs or not (P=0.444-1) , the shock (coma) patients in the non-protected group were more common (34.8%, 8/23) , and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.012) ; Although auricle injury was detected in both groups and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P=1) , but the external ear canal injury, tympanic membrane perforation were more common in the non-protected group, and there was no external ear canal and tympanic membrane perforation in the wearing earplug group, and the difference between the two groups was significant (P=0.000) . After 3-6 months, the rehabilitation of auditory system and other symptoms in patients showed that the hearing loss, tinnitus, earache, headache, dizziness and other symptoms all disappeared in patients wearing earplugs, while the above symptoms in the non-protected group were improved but more persisted, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.000-0.012) , and there was no significant difference in rehabilitation conditions such as craniocerebral injury between the two groups (P=1) ; There were patients with unhealed auricle injury in both groups in 3-6 months after the injury, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P=1) , however, in the non-protected group, 69.57% (16/23) of the patients with external auditory canal injury were still unhealed and none of the patients with tympanic membrane perforation recovered, and the difference between the two groups was obvious (P=0.000~0.001) ; Pure tone air conduction examination showed that the hearing of the earplugs wearers was well recovered at the time of the explosion, while irreversible hearing impairment was common in the non-protective group, the difference was statistically significant (P=0.000) . Conclusion(s): Ear protector plays an important role in protecting the auditory organs and hearing of workers in explosion accident, and it is an effective protective measure to prevent and reduce the damage of external ear canal, perforation of tympanic membrane and explosive hearing loss caused by explosion accidents.

AB  - Objective: Design an optimised auditory azimuth localisation training protocol by: (1) differing the number of training stimuli presentations to determine the highest angular accuracy achieved in the fewest training sessions, (2) evaluating the presence of training transfer from a broadband stimulus to untrained military-relevant stimuli and (3) measuring the effect of differing training strategies on localisation accuracy. Design(s): Two pilot studies of 18 and six subjects, respectively, determined the number of presentations and type of stimuli to be included in a localisation training experiment that evaluated different training strategies. In the pilot studies, participants trained using eight Learning Units (LU) and then tested using untrained stimuli. In the main experiment, 40 participants completed eight LUs using four different learning strategies, with 10 participants randomly assigned to each condition.Sample: All participants were ages 18-42 normal-hearing listeners with thresholds not exceeding 25dB HL and asymmetry not exceeding 15dB HL. Result(s): Transfer of training occurred using three of the four untrained stimuli. The training strategy that resulted in the highest localisation accuracy involved active participation. Conclusion(s): Training with a broadband stimulus transfers to untrained broadband stimuli. Training involving the active participation strategy resulted in the greatest localisation accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to understand workplace factors including safety climate that influence hearing protection device (HPD) use. We sought to investigate the association between HPD use, safety climate, and hearing climate, a new measure specific to hearing. METHOD(S): A survey was developed and distributed among transportation "maintainers" who perform road maintenance and repair. A new hearing climate measure was designed by adapting a safety climate measure. HPD use was assessed by asking workers how often they wear HPD while in noise. The differences in safety climate and hearing climate were compared by the frequency of HPD use using analysis of variance. RESULT(S): Among 166 maintainers, 54% reported always or almost always wearing HPD while noise exposed. High-frequency HPD users reported a statistically significant higher safety climate (P=0.004) and hearing climate (P=0.003). CONCLUSION(S): Hearing climate predicts the frequency of HPD use and may be a useful measure when assessing and improving hearing conservation programs.Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transportation road maintenance and repair workers, or "maintainers," are exposed to hazardous and variable noise levels and often rely on hearing protection devices (HPD) to reduce noise-exposure levels. We aimed to improve upon HPD use as part of the HearWell program that used a Total Worker Health, participatory approach to hearing conservation. METHOD(S): Full-shift, personal noise sampling was performed during the routine task of brush cutting. Work activities and equipment were recorded and combined with 1-min noise measures to summarize personal noise-exposure levels by equipment. Using noise-monitoring results, HPD noise reduction ratings, and input from worker-based design teams, a noise-hazard scheme was developed and applied to the task and equipment used during brush cutting. RESULT(S): Average (standard deviation) and maximum Leq 1-minute, personal noise-exposure levels recorded during brush cutting included chainsaws at 92.1 (7.6) and max of 111dBA, leaf blowers at 91.2 (7.5) and max 107dBA, and wood chipper at 90.3 (7.3) and max of 104dBA. The worker-designed noise-hazard scheme breaks down noise exposures into one of three color bands and exposure ranges: red (over 105dBA), orange (90-105dBA), or yellow (85-90dBA). The scheme simplifies the identification of noise levels, assessment of noise-hazard, and choice of appropriate hearing protection for workers. CONCLUSION(S): Combining noise-exposure assessment with intervention development using participatory methods, we characterized noise exposure and developed an intervention to educate and assist in protecting workers as they perform noisy tasks.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Tinnitus is defined as a phantom sound (ringing in the ears), and can significantly reduce the quality of life for those who suffer its effects. Ten to fifteen percent of the general adult population report symptoms of tinnitus with 1-2% reporting that tinnitus negatively impacts their quality of life. Noise exposure is the most common cause of tinnitus and the military environment presents many challenging high-noise situations. Military noise levels can be so intense that standard hearing protection is not adequate. Recent studies suggest a role for inhibitory neurotransmitter dysfunction in response to noise-induced peripheral deafferentation as a key element in the pathology of tinnitus. The auditory thalamus, or medial geniculate body (MGB), is an obligate auditory brain center in a unique position to gate the percept of sound as it projects to auditory cortex and to limbic structures. Both areas are thought to be involved in those individuals most impacted by tinnitus. For MGB, opposing hypotheses have posited either a tinnitus-related pathologic decrease or pathologic increase in GABAergic inhibition. In sensory thalamus, GABA mediates fast synaptic inhibition via synaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) as well as a persistent tonic inhibition via high-affinity extrasynaptic GABAARs and slow synaptic inhibition via GABABRs. Down-regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission, related to partial peripheral deafferentation, is consistently presented as partially underpinning neuronal hyperactivity seen in animal models of tinnitus. This maladaptive plasticity/Gain Control Theory of tinnitus pathology (see Auerbach et al., 2014; Richardson et al., 2012) is characterized by reduced inhibition associated with increased spontaneous and abnormal neuronal activity, including bursting and increased synchrony throughout much of the central auditory pathway. A competing hypothesis suggests that maladaptive oscillations between the MGB and auditory cortex, thalamocortical dysrhythmia, predict tinnitus pathology (De Ridder et al., 2015). These unusual oscillations/rhythms reflect net increased tonic inhibition in a subset of thalamocortical projection neurons resulting in abnormal bursting. Hyperpolarizing de-inactivation of T-type Ca2+ channels switches thalamocortical projection neurons into burst mode. Thalamocortical dysrhythmia originating in sensory thalamus has been postulated to underpin neuropathies including tinnitus and chronic pain. Here we review the relationship between noise-induced tinnitus and altered inhibition in the MGB.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the attitudes and behaviors of young adults with hearing impairment (HI), in relation to leisure noise. It was hypothesized that young people with HI would have more negative perceptions of noise exposure than their peers with nonimpaired (normal) hearing (NH) and would engage more frequently in self-protective behaviors. Questionnaires were administered as part of a larger study of young Australians with: (1) preadult onset HI and (2) NH. Data from adults (age range 18 to 24 years; n = 79 with HI, n = 131 with NH) were selected for the current analysis. Attitudes data for HI and NH groups were compared using chi-square tests, and the reported use of hearing aids and personal hearing protectors (PHPs) in leisure environments was quantified. Most participants with HI and NH regarded leisure noise as a health hazard but rated their own noise-injury risk as lower than that of their peer group. The use of PHPs was low overall, and many participants with HI reported using hearing aids (switched on) during noisy leisure activities. An equal and substantial proportion of participants with HI and NH reported dislike and avoidance of loud activities. Systematic noise management in leisure environments would address noise-injury risk and also enhance social participation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians and dancers can be considered an at-risk population for developing noise-induced hearing loss. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the audiological profile of members of a folklore-related music group and quantify noise exposure at their rehearsal venue. METHOD(S): This was a quantitative and descriptive study. The musicians and dancers were evaluated in two stages: an interview about their working life, followed by high frequency tonal audiometry. The sound pressure level in the group's rehearsal venue was measured using a BEK 2270 Noise Analyzer. RESULT(S): A total of 7.2% of the subjects had noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and 39% of the audiometric tests were notch type. During the interview 31.7% of the subjects mentioned discomfort from loud noise, although none of them used ear protection. The environmental assessment showed inadequate humidity and oscillating temperature. Twenty sound pressure level measurements were performed for Leq (equivalent sound pressure levels) and the results ranged from 88 dB (A) to 99 dB (A) with a mean of 97.05. CONCLUSION(S): Exposure to high levels of sound pressure has led to NIHL in some members of the group. Some of those with normal hearing also presented a notch configuration characteristic of NIHL. Tinnitus, indicating that a change in hearing has occurred, was the most frequent auditory symptom.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Few epidemiological studies have examined the relationship between earphone usage and hearing loss in adolescents. This study identified the prevalence of hearing loss in South Korean adolescents using representative national survey data and evaluated the relationship between earphone usage in a noisy environment and hearing loss. This study analyzed 532 subjects (12-19 years) who participated in a 2012 national survey and completed health and noise environment exposure questionnaires and pure tone audiometry (PTA) test. Hearing loss was defined as an average hearing threshold of 26 Decibel-A (dBA) or higher in PTA. The relationship between earphone usage and hearing loss was analyzed using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Adolescents who were exposed to high noise levels via headphones in a noisy environment had a hearing loss prevalence of 22.6% and adolescents who used earphones 80 minutes or more per day on average had the hearing loss prevalence of 22.3%. The results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that adolescents who used earphones in a noisy environment had a 4.5-fold higher risk of hearing loss and an 8.4 times higher risk of having a subjective hearing problem than those who did not use earphones (prevalence odds ratio (pOR) = 4.54, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-15.24; pOR = 8.39, 95% CI: 1.12-62.83, respectively). Additionally, adolescents who used earphones more than 80 minutes per day in a noisy environment had a 4.7 times higher risk of hearing loss than those who used them less than 80 minutes per day (pOR = 4.68, 95% CI: 1.08-20.22). Longitudinal studies are needed to provide evidence of causality between earphone usage and hearing loss.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Wildland firefighters are exposed to numerous noise sources that may be hazardous to their hearing. This study examined the noise exposure profiles for 264 wildland firefighters across 15 job categories. All 264 firefighters completed questionnaires to assess their use of hearing protection devices, enrollment in hearing conservation programs, and their overall perception of their noise exposure. Roughly 54% of firefighters' noise exposures exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommended exposure limit of 85 decibels, A-weighted, over 8hr, and 32% exceeded the Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit of 90 decibels, A-weighted, over 8hr. Questionnaire results indicated good agreement between noise exposures and firefighters' perceptions of the noise hazard. Approximately 65% reported that they used some form of hearing protection; however, only 19% reported receiving any proper training regarding the use of hearing protection devices, with the majority of those firefighters relying on earplugs, including electronic and level-dependent earplugs, over earmuffs or other forms of hearing protectors. The results also suggest that improved communication and situational awareness play a greater role in the consistent use of hearing protection devices than other factors such as risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss. The study highlighted the challenges facing wildland firefighters and their management and the need for a comprehensive wildland fire agencies' hearing conservation program especially for firefighters who were exempt based on their occupational designations.

AB  - Mechanosensory hair cells are the receptor cells of hearing and balance. Hair cells are susceptible to death from a variety of insults, including aging, noise trauma, and treatment with therapeutic drugs with ototoxic side effects. Two important classes of ototoxic drugs are the aminoglycoside antibiotics (i.e., neomycin, gentamicin) and platinum based anti-cancer drugs (i.e., cisplatin, carboplatin). These lifesaving drugs result in significant permanent hearing loss for many patients who receive them. Sensory hair cells are surrounded by a type of specialized glia called supporting cells. Supporting cells serve a number of functions, including providing structural and trophic support to hair cells. We showed previously that supporting cells can protect hair cells from death caused by exposure to the ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin. Here we show that the mechanism by which supporting cells protect hair cells is via release of secretory exosomes. Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle that can carry a variety of protein and nucleic acid cargo. Exosomes can mediate intercellular signaling and alter function in recipient cells that either internalize the exosomes or interact with exosomes at the plasma membrane. Our data demonstrate a mechanism by which glial cells promote the survival of sensory cells under stress via a mechanism of intercellular signaling via exosomes.

AB  - Background: Machines, processes, and tasks in the iron and steel factories may produce noise levels that are harmful to hearing if not properly controlled. Studies documenting noise exposure levels and related determinants in sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania are lacking. The aim of this study was to document noise exposure and to identify determinants of noise exposure with a view to establishing an effective hearing conservation programme. Method(s): A walk-through survey was conducted to describe the working environment in terms of noise sources in four metal factories (A-D) in Tanzania. Noise measurements were conducted by both personal, full-shift noise measurements (8 h) using dosimeters and area measurements (10-s measurements) using a sound level meter. A total of 163 participants had repeated personal noise measurements (Factory A: 46 participants, B: 43, C: 34, and D: 40). Workers were randomly selected and categorized into 13 exposure groups according to their job. Linear mixed effects models were used to identify significant determinants of noise exposure in the furnace section and the rolling mill section. Result(s): The average personal noise exposure in the four factories was 92.0 dB(A) (range of job group means; 85.4-96.2 dB(A)) (n = 326). Personal exposure was significantly higher in the rolling mill section (93.0 dB(A)) than in the furnace section (89.6 dB(A)). Among the job groups, the cutters located in the rolling mill section had the highest noise exposure (96.2 dB(A)). In the furnace section, furnace installation (below the ground floor), manual handling of raw materials/billets/crowbars, and billet weighing/transfer were significant determinants explaining 40% of the total variance in personal noise exposure. In the rolling mill section, the size of the cutting machine, steel billet weight and feeding re-heating furnace explained 46% of the total variance in personal noise exposure. The mean noise level of the area measurements was 90.5 dB(A) (n = 376). Conclusion(s): Workers in the four iron and steel factories in Tanzania were exposed to average noise of 92.0 dB(A), without using hearing protection, implying a high risk of developing hearing loss. Task and factory level determinants were identified in the furnace and the rolling mill sections of the plant, which can inform noise control in factories with similar characteristics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Effective voice communication is essential when operating aircraft. Because of the loud operating environment in fighter cockpits, it has been a challenge to provide effective communication while simultaneously protecting the hearing sense. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using bone conducting transducers (BCT) in place of legacy communications systems in fighter cockpits. METHOD(S): A military flight helmet was modified and outfitted with BCT and air-conducting speakers. BCT were independently tested against air-conducting speakers using a clinical audiometer under three conditions: without earplugs, with earplugs, and with earplugs in the presence of 100-dB broad-spectrum noise. Three test subjects were given an audiological examination using tones of varying intensity ranging from 100 Hz to 8000 Hz. The lowest hearable intensity indicated by button press was recorded for each frequency. RESULT(S): In the presence of 100-dB ambient noise, bone conducting transducers performed better than air-conducting speakers at all frequencies. Hearability of BCT by audiogram was, on average, 10-20% lower intensity (dB) than air-conducting speakers. DISCUSSION: Currently, USAF pilots wear two layers of hearing protection; i.e., the helmet's integrated earcup and some form of ear plug (e.g., foam earplug or custom-molded earbud). Our results suggest that bone conducting audio transducers may be better for layered hearing protection than air-conducting speakers when used with foam earplugs. Given the cost, complexity, and non-interoperability of custom-molded earphones, helmet-integrated bone conducting transducers and foam earplugs may be a better option for sustained airborne operations.Bradke BS, White Z, Poston J.

AB  - Over the last century, hearing research has repeatedly reported differences in loudness perception when different types of transducers are being used. One of the effects of using different transducers is that listening may be performed via an open ear (loudspeaker), a cushioned ear (headphones), or an occluded ear (hearing aid receivers, insert earphones). The question of whether varying the acoustic load applied to the ear canal might impact hearing sensitivity has therefore become essential given the need to establish realistic noise damage risk criteria in an attempt to prevent noise-induced hearing loss for any given listening condition. Although such loudness discrepancies in the cushioned ear have been recently proven to be caused by loudness measurement artifacts, currently available data do not exclude a possible impact of ear canal occlusion on loudness perception. This paper presents the results of a loudness balance test carried out on 18 normal-hearing listeners. Using an earplug to occlude the canal, in-ear sound pressure levels were compared between the occluded ear and the cushioned ear at equal loudness. The results show agreement within 1dB between the two listening conditions, and support the conclusion that loudness does not depend on the type of acoustic load applied to the ear canal.

AB  - Sleep is important for human neurocog-nitive, emotional and physical health. Increasing evidence shows that the intensive care unit environment is disruptive to sleep patterns. Such disruption is unpleasant to patients, but mounting evidence suggests that it may also worsen outcome. However, improvements in the patient experience are readily obtained through simple measures such as the use of eye-pads and earplugs. Early data suggest that such interventions are not only kind, but may impact on patient outcomes such as delirium rates.Copyright © 2017, Pharmamed Mado Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the ongoing challenges for hearing researchers is successful protection of the ear from noise injury. For decades, the most effective methods have been based on modifying the acoustic properties of the noise, either by reducing noise output from various sources, interfering in the acoustic exposure path with environmental controls, or altering the noise dose for the individual with personal hearing protection devices. Because of the inefficiencies of some of the acoustic modification procedures, pharmaceutical otoprotection is targeted at making the cochlea less susceptible to injury. Short-duration, high-level impulse noises, typically caused by small-scale explosions, cause different sets of injuries in the ear than long-duration, low-variance noise exposures. Therefore, the expectation is that the ears exposed to impulse noise may need different pharmaceutical interventions, both in type of compounds used and the time course of administration of the compounds. The current review discusses four different classes of compounds that have been tested as impulse noise otoprotectants. In the process of describing those experiments, particular emphasis is placed on the acoustic properties of the impulses used, with the goal of providing context for evaluating the relevance of these different models to human impulse noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Background Labeled noise reduction (NR) data presented by manufacturers are considered one of the main challenging issues for occupational experts in employing hearing protection devices (HPDs). This study aimed to determine the actual NR data of typical HPDs using the objective fit testing method with a microphone in real ear (MIRE) method. Methods Five available commercially earmuff protectors were investigated in 30 workers exposed to reference noise source according to the standard method, ISO 11904-1. Personal attenuation rating (PAR) of the earmuffs was measured based on the MIRE method using a noise dosimeter (SVANTEK, model SV 102). Results The results showed that means of PAR of the earmuffs are from 49% to 86% of the nominal NR rating. The PAR values of earmuffs when a typical eyewear was worn differed statistically (p < 0.05). It is revealed that a typical safety eyewear can reduce the mean of the PAR value by approximately 2.5 dB. The results also showed that measurements based on the MIRE method resulted in low variability. The variability in NR values between individuals, within individuals, and within earmuffs was not the statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion This study could provide local individual fit data. Ergonomic aspects of the earmuffs and different levels of users experience and awareness can be considered the main factors affecting individual fitting compared with the laboratory condition for acquiring the labeled NR data. Based on the obtained fit testing results, the field application of MIRE can be employed for complementary studies in real workstations while workers perform their regular work duties.Copyright © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Introduction. At present, it is estimated that more than one million workers are employed as welders worldwide with more than three million performing welding as part of their work duties. Objectives. The aim of this study was to assess workers' level of awareness towards occupational hazards and their adherence to safety measures. Methodology. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 25 to March 10, 2013 among welding factory workers. The study included 278 workers selected by simple random sampling, and data were collected by using structured and pretested questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 16 statistical package. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to found the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variables. Result. One hundred thirty-five (51.9%) respondents had knowledge on occupational hazards and 225 (86.5%) workers used personal protective equipments. Variables such as work experience, work type, safety training, work regulation, and guideline had significant association with the knowledge of respondents: (AOR: 0.44 (0.19, 0.99)), (AOR: 0.38 (0.22, 0.65)), (AOR: 0.33 (0.17, 0.63)), and (AOR: 0.31 (0.15, 0.67)), respectively. Educational status, work experience, safety training, and availability of work regulation were found to be associated with PPE use (AOR: 13.20 (10.65, 16.46)), (AOR: 0.03 (0.003, 0.34)), (AOR: 0.02 (0.01, 0.09)), and (AOR: 0.06 (0.02, 0.21)), respectively. Conclusion and Recommendation. Nearly half of respondents had knowledge about occupational hazards and high proportion of study subjects were used personal protective equipments. Safety and health training was the common factor to increase knowledge and personal protective usage practicing habits. Employers and other responsible bodies should encourage training and regular supervision should be made including on workers' safety and well-being.Copyright © 2019 Berhe Beyene Gebrezgiabher et al.

AB  - Background: The role of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) as a source of income is rapidly gaining importance in the economically difficult times in Zimbabwe. Small-scale miners are now responsible for over 50% of the Zimbabwean gold production. However, the sector is still characterised by high labour-intensity, low productivity and capital, limited mechanisation and outdated technologies. Since increasing efforts in recent years to improve miners' health while reducing the exposure to mercury have not been effective, a more sustainable approach is needed to identify interventions targeting the health of artisanal and small-scale miners and the mining communities. Objective(s): The main objective of this study was the accurate and extensive empirical identification of the determinants of health in ASGM and of the miners' health needs. In tandem with these needs, topics which generate more effective, sustainable, and feasible future health interventions targeting occupational health should be identified. Method(s): Based on the identification of determinants of health, a health needs assessment (HNA) was used to conduct miners' needs by applying a mixed methods approach and triangulation. This included qualitative and quantitative interviews with individuals, group interviews, focus group discussions, observations and informal conversations. Result(s): There were 85 structured and 84 semi-structured interviews, a focus group discussion, and observations conducted. Six main themes were identified around which miners' health needs can be aggregated as follows: living conditions, nutrition and hygiene; safe work environment and mining processes; financial support; health care services; formalisation and education. Discussion(s): The following aspects were considered most important for sustainable interventions: possible health impacts, feasibility, value for miners and their willingness to adapt. Accordingly, interventions aiming at increasing education, knowledge and awareness of miners were identified as most promising in improving occupational health.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians are at risk of hearing loss from sound exposure, and earplugs form part of many musicians' hearing conservation practices. Although musicians typically report a range of difficulties when wearing earplugs, there are many who have managed to successfully incorporate earplugs into their practice of music. OBJECTIVE(S): The study aim was to provide a detailed account of earplug usage from the perspective of the musician, including motivating factors, practical strategies, and attitudes. METHOD(S): In-depth interviews with 23 musicians were transcribed and content analysis was performed. Responses were coded and classified into three main themes: advantages, disadvantages, and usage patterns and strategies, together with an overlapping fourth theme, youth perspectives. RESULT(S): Several positive aspects of wearing earplugs were identified, including long-term hearing protection and reduced levels of fatigue and pain. Musicians reported that earplugs present few problems for communication, improve sound clarity in ensembles, are discreet, and are easy to handle. However, earplugs also present challenges, including an overall dullness of sound, reduced immediacy, and an impaired ability to judge balance and intonation due to the occlusion effect, all of which influence usage habits and patterns. CONCLUSION(S): The experiences of the younger musicians and long-term users of earplugs indicate that practice, persistence, and a flexible approach are required for successful earplug usage. In time, there may be greater acceptance of earplugs, particularly amongst a new generation of musicians, some of whom regard the earplugs as a performance enhancement tool as well as a protective device.

AB  - Background: Loud noises in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) exacerbate patient cardiac and respiratory activity, disrupt sleep, and may contribute to hearing deficits, speech and language disorders, and neurodevelopmental delays among NICU graduates. Aim(s): This study evaluated infant-patient tolerance and nurse ease of use of a novel frequency-selective hearing protection device, DREAMIES (NEATCap Medical, LLC). Study design and subjects: Fifty neonates receiving care in a Level III NICU participated in a 2-phase prospective study. In Phase 1, 25 infants (mean 36.6 wks GA) wore DREAMIES for two consecutive 30-min periods. In Phase 2, 25 infants (mean 34.8 wks GA) wore DREAMIES between care and feeding times during an 8-h Device-On period followed by an 8-h Device-Off period for three consecutive days. Outcome measures: Subject tolerance was defined by device-related skin irritation, vital sign measurements, and behavioral state. Device fit and ease of use were also evaluated by NICU nurses. Result(s): No skin breakdown was reported in any infant in either phase. Only transient skin erythema was observed. Periods when infants wore DREAMIES resulted in lower heart and respiratory rates and increased sleep (P < 0.001). Nurses reported little to no difficulty in applying or removing the device. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest DREAMIES are a safe, easy to use, and effective device that reduces exposure to NICU noise, and may improve cardio-respiratory activity and promote sleep among neonatal patients. Further studies are warranted to examine longer term use and potential benefits of DREAMIES for improving outcomes in infants receiving NICU care.

AB  - Introduction: Occupational noise exposure is one of the main risk factor that affects the health and sleeping pattern of the workers. Textile machines produce a high level of noise that can cause adverse health effects in workers. Aim(s): This study was conducted to investigate the effects of occupational noise exposure on sleep among the workers of textile industry. Material(s) and Method(s): The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 60 workers of textile industry located in the Savadkuh city, Iran. In this study, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and an author-developed questionnaire was used to collect the data. Eight-hour equivalent noise level was measured to assess worker's noise exposure based on ISO 9612:2009. Data were examined by Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test, simple liner regression and stepwise multiple regression test. Result(s): The mean+/-SD of equivalent sound level, age and experience was 94+/-4.1 dB, 35+/-7.6 years and 10+/-6.2 years, respectively. The results of Kruskal-Wallis test showed that higher age and duration of work experience were significantly associated with sleep disturbance. The results of Mann-Whitney test showed that history of sedative drug use, marital status and use of Hearing Protective Devices (HPDs) were significantly associated with sleep disturbance. The mean sleep disturbance was significantly different between history of hypnotic drug use, marital status and HPDs. The stepwise multiple regression test showed that age, noise exposure, marital status, use of HPDs and history of sedative drug use could predict 87% of sleep changes. Conclusion(s): The results of the present study confirm that, among many factors affecting worker's sleep, noise exposure plays an important role. It is suggested that the managers and the manufacturers should motivate the workers to use HPDs, thereby controlling the noise exposure and subsequently sleep disturbance in the workers.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Noise is the most common environmental stressor source for premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Venous sampling is one of the most painful-causing actions in newborns. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of voice loss using ear protector on pain caused by intravenous sampling and heart rate of premature infants. METHOD(S): This randomized clinical trial study was performed on 112 premature infants aged between 28-36 weeks who were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (56 subjects) and control (n=56). The ear protector was used for the intervention group when the baby was subjected to intravenous sampling. Neonatal pain was measured by PIPP instrument (premature infant pain measuring instrument) in five steps (2 minutes before the needle penetration), (moment of needle penetration), (pump time), (moment of needle withdrawal) and (5 minutes after needle withdrawal). Heart rate was measured with a pulse oximeter (8 times every 30 minutes during 4 hours after using the ear protector) and compared. (IRCT: 2015210828925N1). FINDINGS: The mean changes in PIPP score were in the intervention and control groups (1.6+/-5.6 and 4.6+/-1.6), second (12.1+/-3.3, and 12.6+/-2.8), third (13.5+/-2.7 and 13.4+/-2.9), fourth (6.4+/-2.6 and 8.5+/-2.8), and fifth (5.1+/-4.2) and 1.6+/-6.2) respectively. Scores in all states except for the second and third stages were statistically significant in both groups (p<0.05). In addition, the mean of heart rate in the fifth stage in the intervention group (145.8+/-16.6) was significantly higher than the control group (138.1+/-21.1) (p=0.03). CONCLUSION(S): The results of the study showed that the ear protector used for premature infants is effective in reducing pain during venipuncture.Copyright © 2017, Babol University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: Exposure to recreational noise, particularly music exposure, is considered one of the biggest public health hazards of our time. Some important influencing factors such as socioeconomic status, educational background, and cross-cultural perspectives have previously been found to be associated with attitudes toward loud music and the use of hearing protection. Although culture seems to play an important role, there is relatively little known about how it influences perceptions regarding loud music exposure in young adults. Purpose(s): The present study was aimed to explore cross-cultural perceptions of and reactions to loud music in young adults (18-25 yr) using the theory of social representations. Research Design: The study used a cross-sectional survey design. Study Sample: The study sample included young adults (n5534) fromfive different countries (India, Iran, Portugal, the United States, and the United Kingdom) who were recruited using convenience sampling. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using a content analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and also X2 analysis. Result(s): Fairly equal numbers of positive and negative connotations (z40%) were noted in all countries. However, the x2 analysis showed significant differences between the countries (most positive connotations were found in India and Iran, whereas the most negative connotations were found in the United Kingdom and Portugal) regarding the informants' perception of loud music. The co-occurrence analysis results generally indicate that the category ''negative emotions and actions'' occurred most frequently, immediately followed by the category ''positive emotions and actions.'' The other most frequently occurring categories included ''acoustics,'' ''physical aliment,'' ''location,'' and ''ear and hearing problems.'' These six categories formed the central nodes of the social representation of loud music exposure in the global index. Although some similarities and differences were noted among the social representations toward loud music among countries, it is noteworthy that more similarities than differences were noted among countries. Conclusion(s): The study results suggest that ''loud music'' is perceived to have both positive and negative aspects within society and culture. We suggest that the health promotion strategies should focus on changing societal norms and regulations to be more effective in decreasing the noise-and/or musicinduced auditory symptoms among young adults.

AB  - Purpose: Poor sleep quality in intensive care unit (ICU) can be associated with poor outcome. Excessive noise and lights in ICU are known to disrupt patients' sleep by causing arousals. Study design: A prospective randomized controlled study. Material(s) and Method(s): The patients admitted to the medical ICU were prospectively included and randomized to receive earplugs and eye masks or no intervention during their first 5 nights in ICU. Their arousal index and other sleep parameters were measured during the first night by polysomnography. Secondary outcomes including wrist actigraphy profiles and subjective sleep quality were recorded during all study nights. Result(s): Seventeen patients were enrolled. Eight patients were randomized to earplugs and eye masks group and nine patients were randomized to control group during their first 5 nights in the ICU. The use of earplugs and eye masks demonstrated the trend toward lower arousal index during the first night (21.15 (14.60) vs 42.10 (18.20) events per hour, p = 0.086) and increased activity index (activity count/hour) (16.12 (7.99) vs 10.84 (10.39) count/hour, p = 0.059) compared to control group. Polysomnography and actigraphy did not demonstrate good agreement. Conclusion(s): The use of earplugs and eye masks has a trend toward reduction in arousal index and increased activity in patients admitted to ICU. Limited sample size most likely explained insignificant difference in outcomes. Wrist actigraphy did not accurately measure sleep parameters in ICU patients.Copyright © TheAuthor(s). 2020.

Aim and Objectives: To determine the efficacy of the use of earplugs and eye mask to improve sleep quality in ICU patients. Method(s): 15 medical ICU patients were randomized to sleep with or without earplugs and eye mask during their first five nights. Seven patients were in the intervention group and 8 patients were in the control group. Arousal index and other sleep parameters were measured during the first night in ICU using attended polysomnography. Wrist actigraphy and Richard-Campbell sleep questionnaire were utilized to determine daytime activity and sleep quality during all study nights, respectively. Correlation between actigraphy and polysomnography measurements of sleep data were compared. Result(s): The use of earplugs and eye mask during the first night was associated with a trend towards lower arousal index compared to control (29.05 (23.71) vs 35.34 (18.86) events per hour, p=0.197), improvement in sleep quality (59.17 (5.98) vs 56.5 (5.23), p= 0.185) and higher daytime activity in the intervention group compared to the control group (7806 [7003] vs 1556 [3889] counts, p =0.067). Wrist actigraphy and polysomnography data demonstrated only fair agreement in all sleep parameters. Conclusion(s): The use of earplugs and eye mask in medical ICU patients demonstrated a trend towards reduction in arousal index and improvement in sleep quality and daytime activity. Wrist actigraphy did not accurately measure sleep parameters in ICU patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is prevalent and disabling, yet little is known about the extent of recreational noise exposure and hearing protection use. The aim of the present research was to estimate the extent of recreational noise exposure and hearing protection use in a sample representative of the UK adult population. METHOD(S): We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 10,401 UK adults who were representative of the population. RESULT(S): More than 7000 people (n =7590, 73.0%) reported exposure to recreational noise excluding headphone and earphone use in the last 12months. Just 158 people (2.1%) reported wearing hearing protection for every noisy recreational activity. Age (younger people) and beliefs of a behavioral (as opposed to genetic) cause of hearing loss were predictive of both higher recreational noise exposure and greater hearing protection use. Men were more exposed to recreational noise but women were less likely to use hearing protection. CONCLUSION(S): For the first time, the present research quantifies the recreational noise exposure and low levels of hearing protection use in a representative sample of the UK population. The biggest public health gains are likely to be achieved through interventions targeted at younger people and in explaining behavioral (as opposed to genetic) causes of hearing loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is essential for the physical and psychological restoration of inpatients, and lack of sleep results in sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality, with potentially harmful consequences. AIM: To summarise sleep-promoting interventions in the Intensive care unit (ICU) and acute ward setting. METHOD AND RESULTS: Six databases were searched to obtain studies for review and eight studies were selected, appraised, analysed and produced two themes: sleep-disturbing factors and sleep-promoting strategies. Sleep-disturbing factors included environmental factors (such as light and noise), illness-related factors (such as pain, anxiety and discomfort), clinical care and diagnostics. Sleep-promoting strategies included using pharmacological aids (medication) and non-pharmacological aids (reducing noise and disturbances, eye masks, earplugs and educational and behavioural changes). CONCLUSION(S): The literature review showed that both ICU and acute ward settings affect patients' sleep and both use similar strategies to improve this. Nevertheless, noise and sleep disturbances remain the most critical sleep-inhibiting factors in both settings. The review recommended future research should focus on behavioural changes among health professionals to reduce noise and improve patients' sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural stability might be influenced by auditory input as humans utilize spatiotemporal information to localise sound sources. Earlier studies investigated the acoustic influence on posture but unfortunately experimental setup, room acoustics and conditions of participants varied widely. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed at recording body sway velocity under clearly defined acoustic conditions in a homogenous group of young healthy participants. METHOD(S): Thirty participants performed five stance tasks (standing eyes open/closed, standing on a foam support eyes open/closed, Tandem Romberg test eyes closed) under four acoustic conditions (in quiet, with a loudspeaker presenting continuous/interrupted noise, with ear protectors) in two different rooms (long/short reverberation time). Body sway velocity was determined close to body's centre of gravity. RESULT(S): Postural stability decreased significantly when continuous noise was applied and increased significantly when interrupted noise was presented in the reverberant room. The usage of ear protectors increased body sway velocity compared to quietness in both rooms. CONCLUSION(S): An impaired auditory input by plugging/acoustic masking reduced postural control. Interrupted noise seems to provide a continuously repeated feedback about the postural position in a reverberant room. Hence, the effect of hearing on posture highly depends on the structure of the auditory signal, the sensorimotor condition and the acoustic environment.

AB  - Introduction: The development of modern automated machines in industries has considerably decreased the physical burden of workers in addition to increasing the productivity of the industries resulting in noise pollution. Noise exposure above the limit value of 90 dB (A) is known to cause temporary hearing loss among exposed workers. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional-based cross-sectional study design was employed for a total of 406 study participants using a simple random sampling technique from January 15 to April 30, 2019. The data collection methods were observational checklist and a selfadministered questionnaire. The collected data were entered into EpiData software version 4.2 and exported to SPSS software version 21 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic analyses wwere used to identify the associated factors. Statistical significance was declared using a 95% confidence interval and a p-value of less than 0.05. Result(s): A total of 388 study participants were included in the study with a response rate of 95.6%, of which 254 (65.5%) were females. The overall temporary hearing loss among the textile factory workers was found to be 49% with COR=1.53; 95% CI (1.15-2.03). The workers from the spinning department were 2.38 times more likely to develop temporary hearing loss after exiting from work than workers from the dyeing department (95% CI=(1.16-4.90). Similarly, workers from the knitting department were 3.67 times more likely to develop temporary hearing loss after exiting from work than workers from the dyeing department (95% CI=1.42-9.47). Conclusion(s): The present study demonstrated that the workforce in the spinning and knitting departments of the textile factory had a high prevalence of temporary hearing loss than the workers in dyeing and garment working sections. Therefore, the textile factory should provide hearing protection devices to the workers.Copyright © 2021 Angaw et al.

AB  - Occupational voice users are at a higher risk for developing voice disorders due to their vocal demands, such as prolonged periods of work-related voice use and nonideal environmental factors, such as speaking above background noise. The current study focused on the effects of background noise and hearing protection on acoustic-perceptual correlates of voice among steam train engineers. Fourteen participants phonated vowel /a/, read a phrase, and described a map under different noise and hearing protection conditions. Relative sound pressure level, relative fundamental frequency, and perceived vocal effort and disturbance decreased in the presence of hearing protection for all noise conditions. In contrast, these acoustic measures increased in the absence of hearing protection supporting Lombard effect. Overall, results of the current study provide insight into possible risks to vocal health in workers exposed to high levels of background noise and use hearing protection.Copyright © 2021 The Voice Foundation

AB  - Investigation of the brain's functional connectome can improve our understanding of how an individual brain's organizational changes influence cognitive function and could result in improved individual risk stratification. Brain connectome studies in adults and older children have shown that abnormal network properties may be useful as discriminative features and have exploited machine learning models for early diagnosis in a variety of neurological conditions. However, analogous studies in neonates are rare and with limited significant findings. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) framework for early prediction of cognitive deficits in very preterm infants based on functional connectome data from resting state fMRI. Specifically, we conducted feature selection via stacked sparse autoencoder and outcome prediction via support vector machine (SVM). The proposed ANN model was unsupervised learned using brain connectome data from 884 subjects in autism brain imaging data exchange database and SVM was cross-validated on 28 very preterm infants (born at 23-31 weeks of gestation and without brain injury; scanned at term-equivalent postmenstrual age). Using 90 regions of interests, we found that the ANN model applied to functional connectome data from very premature infants can predict cognitive outcome at 2 years of corrected age with an accuracy of 70.6% and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76. We also noted that several frontal lobe and somatosensory regions, significantly contributed to prediction of cognitive deficits 2 years later. Our work can be considered as a proof of concept for utilizing ANN models on functional connectome data to capture the individual variability inherent in the developing brains of preterm infants. The full potential of ANN will be realized and more robust conclusions drawn when applied to much larger neuroimaging datasets, as we plan to do.Copyright © 2018 The Authors

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to examine hearing thresholds among dental personnel. The secondary aim was to evaluate sound levels among dental equipment that dental personnel are exposed to. METHOD(S): Two hundred forty-four dentists, dental technicians, dental assistants, and dental students participated. Sixty-two participated as a control group. Audiological thresholds for the test groups were compared to the control group. All participants were from Jordan University Hospital. Participants completed a questionnaire in addition to their audiometric testing. Otoscopy, tympanometry, and pure tone audiometry were included in their assessment. Three-factor ANOVA and t tests were utilized to assess the statistical differences of hearing thresholds among the groups and between the two ears. Pearson correlation test was used to assess the effect of age, experience, and duration of exposure on the degree of hearing loss in the test groups for both ears. RESULT(S): The authors reported statistically significant differences among hearing thresholds between the control group and others. Left hearing thresholds were noted to be significantly poorer in the left versus right ear at 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz in dental assistants. The authors also reported a significant relationship between the degree of hearing impairment among dental assistants and the daily duration of exposure to dental occupational noise, followed by age. CONCLUSION(S): Hearing impairment was higher among dental professionals than the control group and especially among dental assistants and technicians. The authors recommended screening guidelines and adapting hearing protection methods for dental professionals and particularly for dental assistants and technicians.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Military pilots are exposed to harmful noise levels, and the two possible effects of this are hearing loss and tinnitus. Objective(s): This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among Saudi military pilots and to determine its association with total flight hours and aircraft type (i.e., fixed and rotary wing). Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Armed Forces Aeromedical Centre, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, between November 2015 and October 2016. A total of 150 Saudi military pilots were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Pure-tone audiometry was used to measure hearing thresholds. Hearing threshold levels were compared between age groups and aircraft category. The association between total flying hours and the development of noise-induced hearing loss was analyzed. Result(s): The overall prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss in the military pilots was 18.4%, with a higher prevalence among fixed-wing pilots (42%) as compared with rotary-wing pilots (23%). Pilots with >=2000 flying hours had a significantly higher hearing threshold compared with those in other categories. Age was a statistically significant risk factor. Conclusion(s): This study found that active pilots of both fixed- and rotary-wing aircrafts are at a high risk of noise-induced hearing loss; however, fixed-wing pilots with >=2000 flying hours are at a higher risk. These findings support recommendations requiring instructions on the proper use of hearing protection devices to avoid noise-induced hearing loss.Copyright © 2018 Saudi Journal of Medicine & Medical Sciences Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Action to prevent noise-induced hearing loss is necessary, especially because many causes of permanent hearing loss are preventable. The aim of this study is to identify and raise awareness of the effect of loud sounds on hearing and effective ways to protect ears among young adults in Jordan. Using non-probability and convenience sampling, 245 students (113 female and 132 males, aged 21.5 years +/- 2.18) from three universities participated in the study and filled the questionnaire completely. The questionnaire consisted of 19 questions targeting hearing health. The answers were analyzed statistically, and comparisons were made using the t-test. Hearing loss was regarded as an important issue by 64.1% of the participants. Among the participants, 58% already suffered from at least one hearing symptom, even though only 9.8% used earplugs to protect their hearing. After receiving information on noise-induced hearing loss, 56.3% were likely or somewhat likely to use earplugs in the future (p < 0.01). This indicates that education and knowledge have a strong influence on student attitudes. It is obvious that the awareness of noise-induced hearing loss among adults in Jordan is very low. The authorities, policymakers, media, and educational institutes should recognize their responsibility in raising the awareness of the danger of loud music among young adults.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The ADHEAR device, a new nonsurgical bone conduction hearing device, has been developed for patients with conductive hearing loss. Objective(s): This study aims to assess the impact of the ADHEAR device on the audiological performance and satisfaction level in subjects with conductive hearing loss. Method(s): Twelve patients with conductive hearing loss were included. All patients received the device for 3 months. The audiological outcomes were determined using basic audiological assessments, including pure tone audiometry and sound field measurements of pure tone and speech audiometry with the contralateral ear occluded with a specific earplug. Additionally, the patients were subjectively evaluated using (1) the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities Questionnaire (SSQ), and (2) the custom-made ADHEAR questionnaire. Result(s): Analysis of the measured audiological outcomes revealed an average improvement in pure tone thresholds (functional gain) of 23 (+/- 4.4) dB HL when the ADHEAR system was used compared to the unaided condition in the sound field. Moreover, speech reception thresholds improved by an average of 23 (+/- 15.3) dB SPL in the aided condition with plugged contralateral ear. Additionally, when using ADHEAR in the sound field, subjects' speech recognition scores improved by 32% (+/- 17.7) in quiet and 21% (+/- 15.1) in the presence of interfering noise. The average SSQ questionnaire scores improved from 3.9 at the study initiation to 6.6 after 3 months of device usage. ADHEAR custom questionnaire assessments revealed high satisfaction and acceptance of the device with no pain or skin irritation. Conclusion(s): During the study period, this new adhesive system yielded improved audiological outcomes with high patient satisfaction and acceptance and no reported skin irritation or pain.© 2020 S.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Background: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes. Objective(s): Primary objective. To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. Secondary objectives. 1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity). 2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age. 3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance. 4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care. Search Method(s): We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2ViewTM), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014. Selection Criteria: Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit. Data Collection and Analysis: We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main Result(s): One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected ag : MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12). Authors' conclusions: To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to excessive noise is the most common preventable cause of hearing loss. It has been estimated that more than 12% of the global population is at risk for hearing loss from noise and about one-third of all cases can be attributed to noise exposure. OBJECTIVE(S): Data on occupational noise and its associated hearing loss are lacking in Jordan. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) among industrial workers in Jordan. METHOD(S): This study included all workers who had been exposed to noise at least three years or more in three plants in Madaba Governorate in Jordan. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. The occupational noise was measured using a portable calibrated sound meter. Pure-tone air conduction audiometry was performed to determine the hearing thresholds in the frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz for both ears of all subjectsRESULTS:This study included 196 workers aged between 20 and 54 years with a mean (SD) of 35.9 (7.2) year. Overall, the prevalence of NIHL among workers was 28.6% (35.0% among those exposed to high level of noise (>85 dB) and 12.5% among workers exposed to low level of noise (<=85 dB)). Age >35 years (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2-6.1), high noise level (OR = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.6-10.5), exposure of more than 10 years (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-5.9), and not using hearing protective devices (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1-6.6) were significantly associated with increased odds of hearing loss. CONCLUSION(S): About one quarter of noise-exposed industrial workers in Jordan has NIHL. Age >35 years, high noise level, exposure of more than 10 years, and not using hearing protective devices were significantly associated with increased risk of NIHL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Actual noise reduction of the earmuffs is considered as one of the main challenges for the evaluation of the effectiveness of a hearing conservation program. OBJECTIVE(S): The current study aimed to determine the real world noise attenuation of current hearing protection devices in typical workplaces using a field microphone in real ear (FMIRE) method. METHOD(S): In this cross-sectional study, five common earmuffs were investigated among 50 workers in two industrial factories with different noise characteristics. Noise reduction data was measured with the use of earmuffs based on the ISO 11904 standard, field microphone in real ear method, using noise dosimeter (SVANTEK, model SV 102) equipped with a microphone SV 25 model. RESULT(S): The actual insertion losses (IL) of the tested earmuffs in octave band were lower than the labeled insertion loss data (p < 0.05). The frequency nature of noise to which workers are exposed has noticeable effects on the actual noise reduction of earmuffs (p < 0.05). The results suggest that the proportion of time using earmuffs has a considerable impact on the effective noise reduction during the workday. CONCLUSION(S): Data about the ambient noise characteristics is a key criterion when evaluating the acoustic performance of hearing protectors in any workplaces. Comfort aspects should be considered as one of the most important criteria for long-term use and effective wearing of hearing protection devices. FMIRE could facilitate rapid and simple measurement of the actual performance of the current earmuffs employed by workers during different work activities.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that there are 466 million people in the world who are currently suffering from hearing loss. Hearing loss can be caused by many factors, including genetic factors, degenerative factors, infectious diseases, trauma, consumption of drugs that can affect the sense of hearing, and noise. One of the work environment that can cause noise is at the airport. At the airport, we can find noise that is quite loud, especially in the ground handling section. This noise comes from the sound of the aircraft engine. If workers in the ground handling section are exposed to noise continuously, then it is possible that the worker will experience hearing loss. Method(s): This type of research is descriptive with cross-sectional design. The research was conducted from April 2018 to November 2018 at Juanda Airport Surabaya. The samples in this study were workers of Jasa Angkasa Semesta Ltd., chosen using a simple random sampling technique. The subjects who fulfilled the criteria were 89 people from 160 workers, i.e. working minimum of 2 years and the age between 20 and 60 years. The research data were obtained from audiometric examinations and the answers of the questionnaire related to the research from the subjects. Result(s): The normal hearing were found in workers with the age range 40-49 years (16.85%), whereas in the age range 50-60 years more workers had bilateral type hearing loss (13.48%). Among male workers, 40.45% have normal hearing, 16.86% unilateral type, 29.21% bilateral type. While in the female workers, 6.74% had normal hearing, 3.37% had both unilateral and bilateral type. The hearing loss mostly happened on workers in the ramp section (+/-93.4 dB) with unilateral and bilateral type of loss, successively 4.49% and 6.74%. The normal hearing were mostly found in workers with working period <10 years (24.72%), meanwhile, the most number of unilateral type was 10-15 years (6.74%), and bilateral type was 16-20 years (12.36%). Workers using ear protectors mostly had normal hearing (25.84%), while workers without ear protectors mostly had unilateral type hearing loss (14.61%). In the bilateral type of hearing loss, there were no significant difference between the workers using and not using ear protectors. Conclusion(s): The workers who mostly get hearing loss are at the age of 50-60 years; in the ramp silver section; working period of 16-20 years; and rarely used ear protectors. We recommend that prevention programmes are held.

AB  - Employees are working on opencast coal mining from May to September work in conditions of heating microclimate. A decrease in the influence of the high temperature of air and solar radiation is reached by the uniform distribution of the hottest time of day (from 12 to 16 o'clock) by drawing up the working schedule. The selection of means of individual protection of hearing organs, their regular use, and efficiency assessment performance will reduce the impact of noise on workers' bodies. Decrease of total working time in conditions of exposure to industrial vibration not exceeding 5-6 hours will allow reducing the class of working conditions on this factor. The effectiveness of individual respiratory protection means the size of dust particles, the degree of insulation of the underwear space in places where the mask is not tightly attached to the face. Considering dust dispersion, working conditions classes of workers engaged in brown coal mining in underground mine #9 "Angrenskaya" decreased by 1 stage, while in mine "Shargunkumir" the working conditions classes on dust factor, on the contrary, increased by 1 stage.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

AB  - Critically ill patients, their relatives, and intensive care staff are consistently exposed to stress. The principal elements of this exceptional burden are confrontation with a life-threatening disease, specific environmental conditions at the intensive care unit, and the social characteristics of intensive care medicine. The short- and long-term consequences of these stressors include a feeling of helplessness, distress, anxiety, depression, and even posttraumatic stress disorders. Not only the patients, but also their relatives and intensive care staff are at risk of developing such psychopathologies. The integration of psychosomatic medicine into the general concept of intensive care medicine is an essential step for the early identification of fear and anxiety and for understanding biopsychosocial coherence in critically ill patients. Preventive measures such as the improvement of individual coping strategies and enhancing the individual's resistance to stress are crucial aspects of improving wellbeing, as well as the overall outcome of disease. Additional stress-reducing measures reported in the published literature, such as hearing music, the use of earplugs and eye-masks, or basal stimulation, have been successful to a greater or lesser extent.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is a deleterious condition affecting up to 60% of patients in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Few SICU-focused delirium interventions have been implemented, including those addressing sleep-wake disruption, a modifiable delirium risk factor common in critically ill patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect on delirium and sleep quality of a multicomponent non-pharmacological intervention aimed at improving sleep-wake disruption in patients in the SICU setting? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a staggered pre-post design, we implemented a quality improvement intervention in two SICUs (general surgery/trauma and cardiovascular) in an academic medical center. After a pre-intervention (baseline) period, a multicomponent unit-wide nighttime (i.e., efforts to minimize unnecessary sound and light, provision of earplugs and eye masks) and daytime (i.e., raising blinds, promotion of physical activity) intervention bundle was implemented. A daily checklist was used to prompt staff to complete intervention bundle elements. Delirium was evaluated twice-daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Patient sleep quality ratings were evaluated daily using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). RESULT(S): Six hundred and forty-six SICU admissions (332 baseline, 314 intervention) were analyzed. Median [IQR) age was 61 [49, 70] years with 35% females and 83% white race. During the intervention period, patients experienced fewer days of delirium (proportion [+/-SD] of intensive care unit days = 15% [+/-27]) as compared to the pre-intervention period (20% [+/-31]; p=0.022), with an adjusted pre-post decrease of 4.9% [95% CI, 0.5-9.2%], p=0.03). Overall RCSQ perceived sleep quality ratings did not change, but the RCSQ noise subscore increased (9.5% [95% CI, 1.1-17.5%], p=0.02). INTERPRETATION: Our multicomponent intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of days patients experienced delirium, reinforcing the feasibility and effectiveness of a non-pharmacological sleep-wake bundle to reduce delirium in critically ill patients in the SICU.Copyright © 2021.
