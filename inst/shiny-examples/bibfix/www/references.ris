TI  - Grassland systems of red meat production: integration between biodiversity, plant nutrient utilisation, greenhouse gas emissions and meat nutritional quality.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Government policies relating to red meat production take account of the carbon footprint, environmental impact, and contributions to human health and nutrition, biodiversity and food security. This paper reviews the impact of grazing on these parameters and their interactions, identifying those practices that best meet governments' strategic goals. The recent focus of research on livestock grazing and biodiversity has been on reducing grazing intensity on hill and upland areas. Although this produces rapid increases in sward height and herbage mass, changes in structural diversity and plant species are slower, with no appreciable short-term increases in biodiversity so that environmental policies that simply involve reductions in numbers of livestock may not result in increased biodiversity. Furthermore, upland areas rely heavily on nutrient inputs to pastures so that withdrawal of these inputs can threaten food security. Differences in grazing patterns among breeds increase our ability to manage biodiversity if they are matched appropriately to different conservation grazing goals. Lowland grassland systems differ from upland pastures in that additional nutrients in the form of organic and inorganic fertilisers are more frequently applied to lowland pastures. Appropriate management of these nutrient applications is required, to reduce the associated environmental impact. New slurry-spreading techniques and technologies (e.g. the trailing shoe) help reduce nutrient losses but high nitrogen losses from urine deposition remain a key issue for lowland grassland systems. Nitrification inhibitors have the greatest potential to successfully tackle this problem. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are lower from indoor-based systems that use concentrates to shorten finishing periods. The challenge is to achieve the same level of performance from grass-based systems. Research has shown potential solutions through the use of forages containing condensed tannins or establishing swards with a high proportion of clover and high-sugar grasses. Relative to feeding conserved forage or concentrates, grazing fresh grass not only reduces GHG emissions but also enhances the fatty acid composition of meat in terms of consumer health. It is possible to influence biodiversity, nutrient utilisation, GHG emissions and the nutritional quality of meat in grass-based systems, but each of these parameters is intrinsically linked and should not be considered in isolation. Interactions between these parameters must be considered carefully when policies are being developed, in order to ensure that strategies designed to achieve positive gains in one category do not lead to a negative impact in another. Some win-win outcomes are identified.

TI  - High biomass removal limits carbon sequestration potential of mature temperate pastures.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Decades of plowing have depleted organic C stocks in many agricultural soils. Conversion of plowed fields to pasture has the potential to reverse this process, recapturing organic matter that was lost under more intensive cropping systems. Temperate pastures in the northeast USA are highly productive and could act as significant C sinks. However, such pastures have relatively high biomass removal as hay or through consumption by grazing animals. In addition, the ability to sequester C decreases over time as previously depleted stocks are replenished and the soil returns to equilibrium conditions. The objective of this research was to use eddy covariance systems to quantify CO(2) fluxes over two fields in central Pennsylvania that had been managed as pastures for at least 35 yr. Net ecosystem exchange measurements averaged over 8 site-years suggested that the pastures were acting as small net C sinks of 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (positive values indicate uptake). However, when biomass removal and manure deposition were included to calculate net biome productivity, the pastures were a net source of -81 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (negative values indicate loss to the atmosphere). Manure generated from the hay that was consumed off site averaged 18 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Returning that manure to the pastures would have only partially replenished the lost C, and the pastures would have remained net C sources. Heavy use of the biomass produced on these mature pastures prevented them from acting as C sinks.

TI  - No-till only increases N2O emissions in poorly-aerated soils
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Denitrification rates are often greater in no-till than in tilled soils and net soil-surface greenhouse gas emissions could be increased by enhanced soil N 2 O emissions following adoption of no-till. The objective of this study was to summarize published experimental results to assess whether the response of soil N 2 O fluxes to the adoption of no-till is influenced by soil aeration. A total of 25 field studies presenting direct comparisons between conventional tillage and no-till (approximately 45 site-years of data) were reviewed and grouped according to soil aeration status estimated using drainage class and precipitation during the growing season. The summary showed that no-till generally increased N 2 O emissions in poorly-aerated soils but was neutral in soils with good and medium aeration. On average, soil N 2 O emissions under no-till were 0.06 kg N ha −1 lower, 0.12 kg N ha −1 higher and 2.00 kg N ha −1 higher than under tilled soils with good, medium and poor aeration, respectively. Our results therefore suggest that the impact of no-till on N 2 O emissions is small in well-aerated soils but most often positive in soils where aeration is reduced by conditions or properties restricting drainage. Considering typical soil C gains following adoption of no-till, we conclude that increased N 2 O losses may result in a negative greenhouse gas balance for many poorly-drained fine-textured agricultural soils under no-till located in regions with a humid climate.

TI  - Soil macroaggregate turnover and microaggregate formation: a mechanism for C sequestration under no-tillage agriculture
PY  - 2000
AB  - Soil disturbance from tillage is a major cause of organic matter depletion and reduction in the number and stability of soil aggregates when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture. No-till (NT) cropping systems usually exhibit increased aggregation and soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the extent of soil organic matter changes in response to NT management varies between soils and the mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in NT systems are unclear. We evaluated a conceptual model which links the turnover of aggregates to soil organic matter dynamics in NT and CT systems; we argue that the rate of macroaggregate formation and degradation (i.e. aggregate turnover) is reduced under NT compared to CT and leads to a formation of stable microaggregates in which carbon is stabilized and sequestered in the long term. Therefore, the link between macroaggregate turnover, microaggregate formation, and C stabilization within microaggregates partly determines the observed soil organic matter increases under NT.

TI  - Impact of gas transport through rice cultivars on methane emission from rice paddy fields
PY  - 1997
AB  - Two Italian rice (Oryza sativa var. japonica) cultivars, Lido and Roma, were tested in the field for methane production, oxidation and emission. In two consecutive years, fields planted with the rice cultivar Lido showed methane emissions 24-31% lower than fields planted with the cultivar Roma. This difference was observed irrespective of fertilizer treatment. In contrast to methane emissions, differences in methane production or oxidation were not observed between fields planted with the two cultivars. Plant-mediated transport of methane from the sediment to the atmosphere was the dominating pathway of methane emission. During the entire vegetation period, the contribution of this pathway to total methane emission amounted to c. 90%, whereas the contribution of gas bubble release and of diffusion through the water column to total methane emission was of minor significance. Results obtained from transport studies of tracer gas through the aerenchyma system of rice plants demonstrated that the root-shoot transition zone is the main site of resistance to plant-mediated gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere. The cultivar Lido, showing relatively low methane emissions in the field, had a significantly lower gas transport capacity through the aerenchyma system than the cultivar Roma. Thus, the observed differences in methane emissions in the field between the cultivars Lido and Roma can be explained by different gas transport capacities. Apparently, these differences in gas transport capacities are a consequence of differences in morphology of the aerenchyma systems, especially in the root-shoot transition zone. It is, therefore, concluded that identification and use of high-yielding rice cultivars which have a low gas transport capacity represent an economically feasible, environmentally sound and promising approach to mitigating methane emissons from rice paddy fields.

TI  - A review on environmental impacts of nutritional strategies in ruminants.
PY  - 1996
AB  - Primary (plant), secondary (animal), and tertiary (human) biological systems are driven by energy, either fossil or renewable energy in biomass. Their ratio shifts from about 10:90 in primary, via 25:75 in secondary, to 90:10 in tertiary systems. Energy input in ruminant production is mainly as plants and plant parts from primary production, and the amount needed per unit product (milk, meat) primarily depends on its digestibility. This is high in young, leafy, whole plants, in roots and tubers, and in reproductive organs (whole seeds) or organ parts (by-products) of mature plants. Use of fossil energy per kilogram of DM for primary production ranges from 1 to 3 MJ in forage to over 8 MJ in concentrate feeds, whereas input per kilogram of milk is 1 to 10 MJ. Biomass energy used in ruminant production contains nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), but in a ratio rarely balanced to the animals requirements. In secondary systems, energy is partitioned between foods of animal origin and waste. The latter contains OM, N, P, K, and gases (CO 2 , CH 4 ), which may cause environmental problems. Losses per kilograms of milk vary and are 10 to 45 g for N, 0 to 3 g for P, and 2 to 20 g for K. Environmental impacts of animal production can be reduced by varying the use of inorganic fertilizer and changing the forage to concentrate ratio. Digestibilities can be improved by proper harvest management. Level and ratio of dietary N, P, and K can be adjusted to requirements by selecting proper ingredients, reducing their loss in waste. Limited scope exists to reduce losses in respiration and fermentation gases.

TI  - Quantitative trait loci analysis of growth response to varying nitrogen sources in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Nitrogen absorption and assimilation is variable among plants as a result of two factors: the source of nitrogen available and the genetic variation among species within the resulting nitrogen pathways. Several genes involved in nitrogen cycling have been identified, yet little is known about the genes that control quantitative responses to different nitrogen sources. With quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in Arabidopsis thaliana recombinant inbred lines (Columbia × Landsberg erecta) we have identified chromosomal regions controlling aerial mass, root mass, and root length when plants are grown in nitrate, ammonium, ammonium nitrate, or low nitrogen treatments. A total of 16 QTL (P < 0.01) were identified among the nitrogen treatments. Most of the QTL were specific to a single treatment. The percentage additive genetic effects of significant QTL were as high as 17%. Five significant QTL corresponded to the locations of candidate genes associated with nitrogen assimilation, while a few QTL corresponded with candidate genes in the developmental pathways. Most QTL were not shared across treatments, suggesting that there is no optimal genotype for all nitrogen sources.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and land use change: a meta analysis
PY  - 2002
AB  - The effects of land use change on soil carbon stocks are of concern in the context of international policy agendas on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (−10%), native forest to plantation (−13%), native forest to crop (−42%), and pasture to crop (−59%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+ 8%), crop to pasture (+ 19%), crop to plantation (+ 18%), and crop to secondary forest (+ 53%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12–15%.

TI  - The role of conservation agriculture in sustainable agriculture
PY  - 2007
AB  - The paper focuses on conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance (no-till, NT) and permanent soil cover (mulch) combined with rotations, as a more sustainable cultivation system for the future. Cultivation and tillage play an important role in agriculture. The benefits of tillage in agriculture are explored before introducing conservation tillage (CT), a practice that was borne out of the American dust bowl of the 1930s. The paper then describes the benefits of CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where NT, mulch and rotations significantly improve soil properties and other biotic factors. The paper concludes that CA is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly management system for cultivating crops. Case studies from the rice–wheat areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia and the irrigated maize–wheat systems of Northwest Mexico are used to describe how CA practices have been used in these two environments to raise production sustainably and profitably. Benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on global warming are also discussed. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to sustainably produce more food from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands. Promoting and adopting CA management systems can help meet this goal.

TI  - The digestion of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Melle) and white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Blanca) by grazing cattle.
PY  - 1988
AB  - 1. Pure swards of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Melle) as a primary growth (May), trimmed primary growth (early June) and regrowth (late June), and white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Blanca) as a mature primary growth (July) and vegetative regrowth (August), were grazed by twelve Friesian steers (mean body-weights throughout experiment 152-231 kg) at daily allocation rates of forage which provided dry matter (DM) intakes ranging from 28 to 36 g/kg body-weight). 2. Total nitrogen contents of the three ryegrasses declined with season (37-20 g/kg DM), but in vitro organic matter (OM) digestibilities were relatively constant (0.76-0.79). The clovers had higher N (average 36.6 g/kg DM) and lower fibre and water-soluble carbohydrate contents than the grasses, and in vitro OM digestibilities of 0.70 and 0.76 respectively. 3. Duodenal digesta samples were obtained, using a portable sampling apparatus from the animals grazing the pasture, and estimates of the flow of nutrients into the small intestine were derived using two indigestible markers which were continuously infused into the rumen using a portable infusion apparatus. Forage intakes were calculated from estimates of faecal output of indigestible OM and the predicted in vivo OM digestibilities of the forages consumed. Coefficients of variation for OM flow to the small intestine and OM intake were 11.8 and 10.9% respectively. 4. The apparent digestion of OM in the rumen ranged from 722 to 741 g/kg digestible OM intake and from 681 to 711 g/kg digestible OM intake for the grass and clover diets respectively. Substantial losses of ingested N before the small intestine were measured on all diets except the regrowth ryegrass. Losses were 0.30 and 0.40 g/g N intake on the primary growth ryegrass and the regrowth clover respectively; N contents were 37 and 39 g/kg DM respectively. 5. Comparison of the values obtained at pasture with that obtained when similar diets were offered to housed cattle (Beever et al. 1985) indicated that combined relations relating duodenal OM and non-ammonia-N (NAN) flows to OM and N intakes respectively could be established for each diet. For two diets (primary-growth grass and regrowth clover) the relations were curvilinear; for the remaining diets, the derived relations were linear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT AND CONVERSION INTO GRASSLAND: EFFECTS ON SOIL CARBON
PY  - 2001
AB  - Grasslands are heavily relied upon for food and forage production. A key component for sustaining production in grassland ecosystems is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM), which can be strongly influenced by management. Many management techniques intended to increase forage production may potentially increase SOM, thus sequestering atmospheric carbon (C). Further, conversion from either cultivation or native vegetation into grassland could also sequester atmospheric carbon. We reviewed studies examining the influence of improved grassland management practices and conversion into grasslands on soil C worldwide to assess the potential for C sequestration. Results from 115 studies containing over 300 data points were analyzed. Management improvements included fertilization (39%), improved grazing management (24%), conversion from cul- tivation (15%) and native vegetation (15%), sowing of legumes (4%) and grasses (2%), earthworm introduction (1%), and irrigation (1%). Soil C content and concentration in- creased with improved management in 74% of the studies, and mean soil C increased with all types of improvement. Carbon sequestration rates were highest during the first 40 yr after treatments began and tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Impacts were greater in woodland and grassland biomes than in forest, desert, rain forest, or shrubland biomes. Conversion from cultivation, the introduction of earthworms, and irrigation resulted in the largest increases. Rates of C sequestration by type of improvement ranged from 0.1 1 to 3.04 Mg C-ha-l yr-l, with a mean of 0.54 Mg C-ha-l yr-l, and were highly influenced by biome type and climate. We conclude that grasslands can act as a significant carbon sink with the implementation of improved management.

TI  - Towards sustainable grassland and livestock management
PY  - 2007
AB  - Grasslands are one of the world's major ecosystems groups and over the last century their use has changed from being volunteer leys, or a resource on non-arable land, to a productive resource equal to any crop and managed as such. Many grasslands are now being acknowledged as having a multifunctional role in producing food and rehabilitating crop lands, in environmental management and cultural heritage. However, grasslands across the globe are under increasing pressure from increasing human populations, reduced areas with increasing livestock numbers, and declining terms of trade for livestock production, and they are managed to varying degrees of effectiveness. The complexity of grassland uses and the many aspects of grassy ecosystems require a framework wherein solutions for better management can be developed. The present paper discusses a generic approach to grassland management to satisfy these multiple objectives. A focus on ecosystem functionality, i.e. on water, nutrient and energy cycling and on the biodiversity required to sustain those functions, provides a means of resolving the dilemmas faced, through the intermediary, management-related, criteria of herbage mass, which also relates directly to animal production. Emphasis is placed on the opportunities to satisfy multiple objectives. A consideration of the basic relationships between stocking rate and animal production shows that the longer-term, economically optimal stocking rate is associated with improved environmental outcomes. There may be environmental objectives that go beyond economically sustainable limits for livestock producers and in those cases direct payments from the government or others will be needed. These are likely to be where degradation is clearly apparent. The achievement of desirable outcomes in grassland management that satisfy multiple objectives will require new areas of research that seek viable solutions for farmers and society.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gases mitigation measures in the European agro-forestry sector: a literature survey.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Over the last 20 years, climate change has become an increasing concern for scientists, public opinions and policy makers. Due to the pervasive nature of its impacts for many important aspects of human life, climate change is likely to influence and be influenced by the most diverse policy or management choices. This is particularly true for those interventions affecting agriculture and forestry: they are strongly dependent on climate phenomena, but also contribute to climate evolution being sources of and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG). This paper offers a survey of the existing literature assessing cost-effectiveness and efficiency of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies or the effects of broader economic reforms in the agricultural and forestry sectors. The focus is mainly on European countries. Different methodological approaches, research questions addressed and results are examined. The main findings are that agriculture can potentially provide emissions reduction at a competitive cost, mainly with methane abatement, while carbon sequestration seems more cost-effective with appropriate forest management measures. Afforestation, cropland management and bioenergy are less economically viable measures due to competition with other land use. Mitigation policies should be carefully designed either to balance costs with expected benefits in terms of social welfare. Regional variability is one of the main drawbacks to fully assess the cost-effectiveness of different measures. Integration of models to take into account both social welfare and spatial heterogeneity seems to be the frontier of the next model generation.

TI  - Tillage and crop residue effects on soil carbon and carbon dioxide emission in corn-soybean rotations.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Soil C change and CO2 emission due to different tillage systems need to be evaluated to encourage the adoption of conservation practices to sustain soil productivity and protect the environment. We hypothesize that soil C storage and CO2 emission respond to conservation tillage differently from conventional tillage because of their differential effects on soil properties. This study was conducted from 1998 through 2001 to evaluate tillage effects on soil C storage and CO2 emission in Clarion-Nicollet-Webster soil association in a corn [Zea mays L.]-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation in Iowa. Treatments included no-tillage with and without residue, strip-tillage, deep rip, chisel plow, and moldboard plow. No-tillage with residue and strip-tillage significantly increased total soil organic C (TC) and mineral fraction C (MFC) at the 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm soil depths compared with chisel plow after 3 yr of tillage practices. Soil CO2 emission was lower for less intensive tillage treatments compared with moldboard plow, with the greatest differences occurring immediately after tillage operations. Cumulative soil CO2 emission was 19 to 41% lower for less intensive tillage treatments than moldboard plow, and it was 24% less for no-tillage with residue than without residue during the 480-h measurement period. Estimated soil mineralizable C pool was reduced by 22 to 66% with less intensive tillage treatments compared with moldboard plow. Adopting less intensive tillage systems such as no-tillage, strip-tillage, deep rip, and chisel plow and better crop residue cover are effective in reducing CO2 emission and thus improving soil C sequestration in a corn-soybean rotation.

AB  - Lynch, D. H., Cohen, R. D. H., Fredeen, A., Patterson, G. and Martin, R. C. 2005. Management of Canadian prairie region grazed grasslands: Soil C sequestration, livestock productivity and profitability. Can. J. Soil Sci. 85: 183‐192. The GrassGro model (a computer simulation of management-induced changes in range and pasture forage and livestock productivity) was combined with spreadsheet analyses to estimate the influence of improved grazing practices on soil organic carbon (SOC), and farm profitability, across native rangelands and tame pastures of the southern Canadian Prairies. Improved practices included complementary grazing (CG) and reduced stocking density (RSD) on rangeland; and N fertilization (FERT), seeded grass/legumes grazed continuously (GLGC) or rotationally (GLGR), and RSD on tame pastures. The analysis was stratified into three ecoregions on the basis of similarities in climate and soil type. Averaged over 30 yr and ecoregions, SOC rates of gain through improved management were 5 (RSD) to 26 (CG) kg C ha ‐1 yr ‐1 for rangelands, and 86 (RSD), 75 (GLGC), 62 (GLGR) and 222 (FERT) kg C ha ‐1 yr ‐1 for tame pastures. Gains with FERT were considered largely negated by associated energy (C) costs, N 2 O emissions, and shifts in grassland species. The CG system alone improved net returns to the producer. The estimated potential combined SOC gain on prairie grazinglands (11.5 Mha) was 1.63 MMT CO 2 yr ‐1 (or 0.465 MMT C yr ‐1 ), slightly less than the 1.70 MMT CO 2 yr ‐1 currently emitted from agricultural soils in Canada.

TI  - Effects of 15 years of conservation tillage on soil structure and productivity of wheat cultivation in northern China
PY  - 2007
AB  - An understanding of long-term tillage and straw management impact on soil structure and productivity is necessary for the further development of conservation tillage practice in dryland farming areas. Data from a 15-year field experiment conducted in Shanxi, on the loess plateau of northern China, were used to compare the long-term effects of no-till and residue cover (NTSC) with conventional tillage (CT) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture. Long-term CT and straw removal resulted in poor soil structure and low productivity. Mean soil bulk density in NTSC was 1.5% less than in CT and capillary porosity ( 2 mm was much greater for NTSC in the 0–0.20 m profile. Soil organic matter and total N and P were 27.9%, 25.6%, and 4.4% greater in NTSC, respectively, and earthworms (19/m2) were found only in the no tillage treatment. Crop yield and water use efficiency tended to be higher under NTSC than under CT, especially in the years of low rainfall, suggesting that the change in soil structure has provided a better environment for crop development. Our 15-year experimental data indicate that NTSC is a more sustainable farming system, which can improve soil structure, and increase productivity with positive environmental impacts in the rainfed dryland farming areas of northern China.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emission from direct seeding paddy field under different rice tillage systems in central China.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Agricultural tillage practices play an important role in the production and/or consumption of green house gas (GHG) that contributes substantially to the observed global warming. Central China is one of the world's major rice producing areas but a few studies have tried to characterize the mechanisms of GHG release from rice paddy field and quantify global warming (GWPs) based on GHGs emission on this region. In this study four tillage systems consisting of no-tillage with no fertilizer (NT0), conventional tillage with no fertilizer (CT0), no-tillage with compound fertilizer (NTC) and conventional tillage with compound fertilizer (CTC) applications in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) cultivation were compared in terms of the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from different tillage systems of the subtropical region of China during the rice growing season in 2008. GWPs based on CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O's cumulative emissions were also compared. Tillage and fertilization had no influence on CO 2 emissions. No-tillage had no effect on N 2 O emissions but significantly affected CH 4 emissions. Application of fertilizer significantly affected CH 4 and N 2 O emissions. Higher CH 4 emissions and lower N 2 O emissions were observed in CTC than in NTC. Cumulative CH 4 emission flux in NTC was 51.68 g CH 4  m −2 while it was 65.96 g CH 4  m −2 in CTC, 28% ( p 2 O emission flux in CTC was 561.00 mg N 2 O m −2 , and was 741.71 mg N 2 O m −2 in NTC, 33% ( p 2 O emissions between NT0 and CT0 systems, but significant in CH 4 emissions. GWP of CTC was 26011.58 kg CO 2  ha −1 , which was 12% higher than that in NTC (23361.3 kg CO 2  ha −1 ), therefore our findings show that no-tillage system was an effective strategy to reduce GWP from rice paddies in central China and thus can serve as a good agricultural system for environmental conservation.

TI  - Methane fluxes from differentially managed grassland study plots: the important role of CH4 oxidation in grassland with a high potential for CH4 production.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Methane oxidation fluxes were monitored with the closed chamber method in eight treatment plots on a semi-wet grassland site near Giessen, Germany. The management regimes differed in the amount of nitrogen (NH 4 NO 3 ) fertilizer applied and in the height of the in-ground water table. No inhibition of CH 4 oxidation occurred, regardless of the amount of annual N fertilizer applied. Instead, the mean CH 4 consumption rates were correlated with the mean soil moisture of the plots. However, the correlation between daily soil water content and corresponding CH 4 oxidation rate was always weak. During drought period (late summer) water stress was observed to restrict CH 4 oxidation rates. The findings led to the question whether methane production with soil depth might modify the CH 4 fluxes measured at the surface. Therefore, two new methods were applied: (1) soil air sampling with silicone probes; and (2) anaerobic incubations of soil cores to test for the methane production potential of the grassland soil. The probe measurements revealed that the CH 4 sink capacity of a specific site was related to the vertical length of its CH 4 oxidizing column, i.e. the depth of the CH 4 producing horizon. Anaerobically incubated soil cores produced large amounts of CH 4 comparable with tropical rice paddy soil. Under field conditions, heavy autumnal rain in 1998 led to a dramatic increase of soil CH 4 concentrations upto 51 μl l −1 at a depth of 5 cm. Nevertheless, no CH 4 was released when soil surface CH 4 fluxes were measured simultaneously. The results thus demonstrate the high CH 4 oxidation potential of the thin aerobic topsoil horizon in a non-aquatic ecosystem.

TI  - Assessment of soil susceptibility to compaction using soil and climatic data bases
PY  - 1987
AB  - Abstract Owing to a wide range of soil types, climatic conditions and crop species, it its impossible to make a quantitative general statement about the effects that agricultural wheel traffic can have on soil compaction and plant response. There is a need to develop a methodlogy to assess the susceptibility of a given soil to compact and to predict the subsequent plant response. This paper outlines one approach being developed in the United States, using basic soil mechanics theory, soil survey data, long-term climatic data bases, and field research results.

TI  - Organic matter and water‐stable aggregates in soils
PY  - 1982
AB  - Summary
The water-stability of aggregates in many soils is shown to depend on organic materials. The organic binding agents have been classified into (a) transient, mainly polysaccharides, (b), temporary, roots and fungal hyphae, and (c) persistent, resistant aromatic components associated with polyvalent metal cations, and strongly sorbed polymers. The effectiveness of various binding agents at different stages in the structural organization of aggregates is described and forms the basis of a model which illustrates the architecture of an aggregate. Roots and hyphae stabilize macro-aggregates, defined as > 250 μm diameter; consequently, macroaggregation is controlled by soil management (i.e. crop rotations), as management influences the growth of plant roots, and the oxidation of organic carbon. The water-stability of micro-aggregates depends on the persistent organic binding agents and appears to be a characteristic of the soil, independent of management.

TI  - Three decades of soil microbial biomass studies in Brazilian ecosystems: lessons learned about soil quality and indications for improving sustainability.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Soil microbial biomass plays important roles in nutrient cycling, plant–pathogen suppression, decomposition of residues and degradation of pollutants; therefore, it is often regarded as a good indicator of soil quality. We reviewed more than a hundred studies in which microbial biomass-C (MB-C), microbial quotient (MB-C/TSOC, total soil organic carbon) and metabolic quotient (qCO2) were evaluated with the objective of understanding MB-C responses to various soil-management practices in Brazilian ecosystems. These practices included tillage systems, crop rotations, pastures, organic farming, inputs of industrial residues and urban sewage sludge, applications of agrochemicals and burning. With a meta-analysis of 233 data points, we confirmed the benefits of no-tillage in preserving MB-C and reducing qCO2 in comparison to conventional tillage. A large number of studies described increases in MB-C and MB-C/TSOC due to permanent organic farming, also benefits from crop rotations particularly with several species involved, whereas application of agrochemicals and burning severely disturbed soil microbial communities. The MB-C decreased in overgrazed pastures, but increased in pastures rotated with well-managed crops. Responses of MB-C, MB-C/TSOC and qCO2 to amendment with organic industrial residues varied with residue type, dose applied and soil texture. In conclusion, MB-C and related parameters were, indeed, useful indicators of soil quality in various Brazilian ecosystems. However, direct relationships between MB-C and nutrient-cycling dynamics, microbial diversity and functionality are still unclear. Further studies are needed to develop strategies to maximize beneficial effects of microbial communities on soil fertility and crop productivity.

TI  - Genetic analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies in mature spring barley plants
PY  - 2001
AB  - Inheritance of the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus utilization in grain production was studied in diallel hybrids of spring barley. Effects of varied NPK fertilization and soil moisture on the genetic variance was evaluated at maturity in pot- and field-grown plants. A preponderance of general combining ability effects was found for the efficiency ratios and utilization efficiencies, suggesting that the generative efficiency indices were mainly controlled by an additive genetic system. However, the relatively high narrow-sense heritabilities (0.33-0.81) found under optimal conditions tended to decline to 0.00-0.36 following water and nutrient shortages. The importance of non-additive gene effects for utilization efficiencies was demonstrated in the field under reduced nutrition. This leads to the conclusion that the involvement of additive gene action should facilitate selection efforts only under favourable environments. Selection delayed until later hybrid generations should be used when trying to improve the nutrient efficiency of barley under less favourable nutrition conditions.

TI  - Mapping of QTL associated with nitrogen storage and remobilization in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves
PY  - 2003
AB  - Nitrogen uptake and metabolism are central for vegetative and reproductive plant growth. This is reflected by the fact that nitrogen can be remobilized and reused within a plant, and this process is crucial for yield in most annual crops. A population of 146 recombinant inbred barley lines (F8 and F9 plants, grown in 2000 and 2001), derived from a cross between two varieties differing markedly in grain protein concentration, was used to compare the location of QTL associated with nitrogen uptake, storage and remobilization in flag leaves relative to QTL controlling developmental parameters and grain protein accumulation. Overlaps of support intervals for such QTL were found on several chromosomes, with chromosomes 3 and 6 being especially important. For QTL on these chromosomes, alleles associated with inefficient N remobilization were associated with depressed yield and higher levels of total or soluble organic nitrogen during grain filling and vice versa; therefore, genes directly involved in N recycling or genes regulating N recycling may be located on these chromosomes. Interestingly, the most prominent QTL for grain protein concentration (on chromosome 6) did not co-localize with QTL for nitrogen remobilization. However, QTL peaks for nitrate and soluble organic nitrogen were detected at this locus for plants grown in 2001 (but not in 2000). For these, alleles associated with low grain protein concentration were associated with higher soluble nitrogen levels in leaves during grain filling; therefore, gene(s) found at this locus might influence the nitrogen sink strength of developing barley grains.

TI  - A model of the physical protection of organic matter in soils
PY  - 1997
AB  - Current computer simulation models do not treat the physical protection of organic matter in soil mechanistically. A model is presented that describes physical protection explicitly as a function of the capacity of clay particles and aggregates to hold organic matter. The net rate of decomposition of organic matter depends not simply on soil texture but on the degree to which the protective capacity of the soil is already occupied. The rate at which organic matter becomes protected depends on both the amount of free organic matter and the degree to which the protective capacity is filled. The rate at which organic matter is released from protection depends only on the amount of protected organic matter. The model closely followed the buildup and decline of organic matter in 10 soils to which grass residues were added each year for a period of 10 yr and then left without addition for a further 10 yr. An estimate made with the model of the maximum capacity of each of these soils to protect organic matter was closely correlated with the clay fraction in the soils. With this model, we were better able to predict the buildup and decline in amounts of soil organic matter in soils of different textures and initial organic matter contents than with conventional, implicit descriptions of protection. Our model accounted for 80% of the variance in the experimental data compared with 77 and 75% using the other two models. Secondly and importantly, the capacity of soil to protect organic matter was found to be positively and well related with the clay content of the soil in our model, whereas similar relationships were not found between soil texture and the parameters controlling protection in the other models.

TI  - Testing DNDC model for simulating soil respiration and assessing the effects of climate change on the CO2 gas flux from Irish agriculture
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Simulation models can be valuable to investigate potential effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. DNDC (the DeNitrification-DeComposition model) was tested against observed soil respiration data from adjacent pasture and arable fields in the Irish midlands. The arable field was converted from grassland approximately 50 years ago and managed since 2003 under two different tillage systems; conventional and reduced tillage. Both fields were located on the same soil type, classified as a free draining sandy loam soil derived from fluvial glacial gravels with low soil moisture holding capacity. Soil respiration measurements were made from January 2003 to August 2005. Three climate scenarios were investigated, a baseline of measured climatic data from a weather station at the field site, and high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios predicted by the Community Climate Change Consortium for Ireland (C4I) based on the Hadley Centre Global Climate Model (HadCM 3 ) and the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario. The aims of this study were to use measured soil respiration rates to validate the DNDC model for estimating CO 2 efflux from these key Irish soils, investigate the effects of future climate change on CO 2 efflux and estimate the efflux uncertainties due to using different future climate projections. The results indicate that the DNDC model can reliably estimate soil respiration from the two fields examined. The model underestimated annual measured CO 2 efflux from the pasture by only13% (model efficiency: ME = 0.6; root mean square error: RMSE = 1.9 and mean absolute error: MAE = 6.3) and that from the arable conventional and reduced tillage by 9% (ME = 0.6; RMSE = 1.6 and MAE = 2.4) and 8% (ME = 0.23; RMSE = 1.8 and MAE = 2.9), respectively. Short-term land use change had no significant effects on CO 2 effluxes from soil. Using the high temperature sensitivity scenario, future C effluxes would increase by 15% for the pasture and 14 and 16% for the arable conventional and reduced tillage systems, respectively. However, under the low temperature sensitivity scenario, lower increases in the C efflux of 6% for the pasture and 5% for the arable field were predicted. The calculated annual CO 2 efflux uncertainties for using the high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios were 9% for the pasture and 8% for the arable field.

TI  - The effects of temperature, water-filled pore space and land use on N2O emissions from an imperfectly drained gleysol
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary
To investigate the effect of soil physical conditions and land use on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere, soil cores of an imperfectly drained gleysol were taken from adjacent fields under perennial ryegrass and winter wheat. The cores were fertilized with ammonium nitrate and incubated at three different temperatures and water-filled pore space (WFPS) values, and N2O emissions were measured by gas chromatography. Emissions showed a very large response to temperature. Apparent values of Q10 (emission rate at (T + 10)°C/emission rate at T°C) for the arable soil were about 50 for the 5–12°C interval and 8.9 for 12–18°C; the corresponding Q10s for the grassland soil were 3.7 and 2.3. Emissions from the grassland soil were always greater than those from the arable soil, although the ratio narrowed with increasing temperature. Changes in soil WFPS also had a profound effect on emissions. Those from the arable soil increased about 30-fold as the WFPS increased from 60 to 80%, while that from the grassland soil increased 12-fold. This latter response was similar to earlier field measurements. The N2O emissions were considered to be produced primarily by denitrification. We concluded that the impacts of temperature and WFPS on emissions could both be explained on the basis of existing models relating increasing respiration or decreased oxygen diffusivity, or both, to the development of anaerobic zones within the soil.

TI  - The environmental consequences of adopting conservation tillage in Europe: reviewing the evidence
PY  - 2004
AB  - Conservation tillage (CT) is practised on 45 million ha world-wide, predominantly in North and South America but its uptake is also increasing in South Africa, Australia and other semi-arid areas of the world. It is primarily used as a means to protect soils from erosion and compaction, to conserve moisture and reduce production costs. In Europe, the area cultivated using minimum tillage is increasing primarily in an effort to reduce production costs, but also as a way of preventing soil erosion and retain soil moisture. A large proportion (16%) of Europe’s cultivated land is also prone to soil degradation but farmers and governments are being slow to recognise and address the problem, despite the widespread environmental problems that can occur when soils become degraded. Conservation tillage can improve soil structure and stability thereby facilitating better drainage and water holding capacity that reduces the extremes of water logging and drought. These improvements to soil structure also reduce the risk of runoff and pollution of surface waters with sediment, pesticides and nutrients. Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation lowers energy consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide, while carbon sequestration is raised though the increase in soil organic matter (SOM). Under conservation tillage, a richer soil biota develops that can improve nutrient recycling and this may also help combat crop pests and diseases. The greater availability of crop residues and weed seeds improves food supplies for insects, birds and small mammals. All these aspects are reviewed but detailed information on the environmental benefits of conservation tillage is sparse and disparate from European studies. No detailed studies have been conducted at the catchment scale in Europe, therefore some findings must be treated with caution until they can be verified at a larger scale and for a greater range of climatic, cropping and soil conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-term tillage and crop residue management in the subarctic: fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide
PY  - 1997
AB  - Methane and nitrous oxide are important radiatively active gases that are influenced by agricultural practices. This study assesses long-term tillage, crop residue management, and N fertilization rates on the flux of these two gases at a high latitude site representing the northern fringe of large-scale agriculture. Cumulative methane uptake for the summer was higher from no-tillage plots than tilled plots. This was associated with lower soil water contents with tillage. Thus, the reduction in CH4 uptake was attributed to water stress on methane oxidizers. At planting, soil water contents were near field capacity, and the no-till plots had the lowest uptake which was attributed to restricted diffusion of methane to active sites. A similar pattern of methane uptake to soil water content was found with the residue management treatments. Removing the straw lowered the soil water content and for most of the season methane uptake was also lower than where the straw had been left on the plots. Nitrogen fertiliz...

TI  - Can biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) genes from perennial Leymus racemosus (Triticeae) combat nitrification in wheat farming
PY  - 2007
AB  - Using a recombinant luminescent Nitrosomonas europaea assay to quantify biological nitrification inhibition (BNI), we found that a wild relative of wheat (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tzvelev) had a high BNI capacity and releases about 20 times more BNI compounds (about 30 ATU g−1 root dry weight 24 h−1) than Triticum aestivum L. (cultivated wheat). The root exudate from cultivated wheat has no inhibitory effect on nitrification when applied to soil; however, the root exudate from L. racemous suppressed \( {\text{NO}}^{ - }_{3} \) formation and kept more than 90% of the soil’s inorganic-N in the \( {\text{NH}}^{ + }_{4} \)-form for 60 days. The high-BNI capacity of L. racemosus is mostly associated with chromosome Lr#n. Two other chromosomes Lr#J, and Lr#I also have an influence on BNI production. Tolerance of L. racemosus to \( {\text{NH}}^{ + }_{4} \) is controlled by chromosome 7Lr#1-1. Sustained release of BNI compounds occurred only in the presence of \( {\text{NH}}^{ + }_{4} \) in the root environment. Given the level of BNI production expressed in DALr#n and assuming normal plant growth, we estimated that nearly 87,500,000 ATU of BNI activity ha−1 day−1 could be released in a field of vigorously growing wheat; this amounts to the equivalent of the inhibitory effect from the application of 52.5 g of the synthetic nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (one AT unit of BNI activity is equivalent to 0.6 μg of nitrapyrin). At this rate of BNI production it would take only 19 days for a BNI-enabled wheat crop to produce the inhibitory power of a standard commercial application of nitrapyrin, 1 kg ha−1. The synthetic nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide, blocked specifically the AMO (ammonia monooxygenase) pathway, while the BNI from L. racemosus blocked the HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase) pathway in Nitrosomonas. Here we report the first finding of high production of BNI in a wild relative of any cereal and its successful introduction and expression in cultivated wheat. These results demonstrate the potential for empowering the new generation of wheat cultivars with high-BNI capacity to control nitrification in wheat-production systems.

During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (206–65 million years ago, Ma) the climate was more uniformly warm and moist than at present and tropical rainforests were widespread. Grasses evolved during the Jurassic period and they expanded greatly as the climate differentiated with reduced rainfall and temperatures. C4-grasses probably arose during the Oligocene period (24–35 Ma). During the Miocene period (23·8–5·3 Ma) grasslands expanded into huge areas (e.g. prairies in the USA, steppe in Eurasia, and pampas and llanos in South America). During the Quaternary period (1·8 Ma till now) some twenty-two different ice ages with periodicities of about 100 000 years occurred. Eighteen-thousand years ago, north-western Europe had a polar climate with tundra vegetation and the Mediterranean region was covered by steppe. During that time Amazonia was so dry that it was covered in extensive areas of savanna and the Sahara expanded rapidly. Only in the last 10 000 years has a closed rainforest covered the Amazonian region again. However, 9000 years ago a brief period of global warming caused excessive rains, which caused the sea and river levels to rise in north-western Europe with tremendous loss of life. The present period of extreme dryness in the Sahara only started some 5000 years ago and then the desert expanded rapidly into the Sahel. Before that the Sahara was covered by steppe. Global warming took place between about ad 900 and about ad 1200 or 1300 just before the Little Ice Age (1550–1700 ad). The article concludes with a description of temperature and vegetation changes that are occurring in Europe at present. It is predicted that C4-grasses, which are already present in southern Europe, will further expand but that, in the short term, land abandonment will have much more deleterious effects than temperature change due to increased wild fires, loss of biodiversity and desertification.

TI  - A high-throughput method for the quantification of proanthocyanidins in forage crops and its application in assessing variation in condensed tannin content in breeding programmes for Lotus corniculatus and Lotus uliginosus.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Lotus corniculatus and Lotus uliginosus are agronomically important forage crops used in ruminant livestock production. The condensed tannin (CT) content, dry matter (DM) production, and persistence of these species are key characteristics of interest for future exploitation of these crops. Here we present field data on 19 varieties of L. corniculatus, 2 varieties of L. uliginosus and, additionally, a glasshouse experiment using 6 varieties of L. corniculatus and 2 varieties of L. uliginosus. Current methods for the quantification of condensed tannins in crop species are slow and labor intensive and are generally based upon polymer hydrolysis following the extraction of chlorophyll in a liquid phase. Presented here is a high-throughput protocol for condensed tannin quantification suitable for microtiter plates based upon the precipitation of condensed tannin polymers in complex with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with subsequent hydrolysis of precipates using butan 1-ol/ hydrochloric acid.

TI  - The Impact of Nitrogen Placement and Tillage on NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 Fluxes from a Clay Loam Soil
PY  - 2006
AB  - To evaluate the impact of N placement depth and no-till (NT) practice on the emissions of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 from soils, we conducted two N placement experiments in a long-term tillage experiment site in northeastern Colorado in 2004. Trace gas flux measurements were made 2–3 times per week, in zero-N fertilizer plots that were cropped continuously to corn (Zea mays L.) under conventional-till (CT) and NT. Three N placement depths, replicated four times (5, 10 and 15 cm in Exp. 1 and 0, 5 and 10 cm in Exp. 2, respectively) were used. Liquid urea–ammonium nitrate (UAN, 224 kg N ha−1) was injected to the desired depth in the CT- or NT-soils in each experiment. Mean flux rates of NO, N2O, CH4 and CO2 ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 μg N m−2 h−1, 60.5 to 92.4 μg N m−2 h−1, −0.8 to 0.5 μg C m−2 h−1, and 42.1 to 81.7 mg C m−2 h−1 in both experiments, respectively. Deep N placement (10 and 15 cm) resulted in lower NO and N2O emissions compared with shallow N placement (0 and 5 cm) while CH4 and CO2 emissions were not affected by N placement in either experiment. Compared with N placement at 5 cm, for instance, averaged N2O emissions from N placement at 10 cm were reduced by more than 50% in both experiments. Generally, NT decreased NO emission and CH4 oxidation but increased N2O emissions compared with CT irrespective of N placement depths. Total net global warming potential (GWP) for N2O, CH4 and CO2 was reduced by deep N placement only in Exp. 1 but was increased by NT in both experiments. The study results suggest that deep N placement (e.g., 10 cm) will be an effective option for reducing N oxide emissions and GWP from both fertilized CT- and NT-soils.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes following tillage from a mollisol in the Argentine Rolling Pampa
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Carbon dioxide emission from soil plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Short term losses of soil carbon due to tillage are of a variable magnitude. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of plowing the soil on CO2-C emissions during summer in a coarse-loamy mixed thermic Typic Hapludoll from the Argentine Rolling Pampa. Temperature after tillage was higher in the plowed soil than under no-tillage, being higher the soil water content in the later treatment. Plowing the soil did not produce an immediately impact on soil surface CO2-C emission, but induced an important CO2-C flush few days later. A difference of 16 up to 25 kg C ha–1 d–1 in the CO2-C emissions was observed from the second up to the fourth sampling dates after tillage. Difference in total CO2-C emissions between the plowed soil and the no-tillage treatment was 580 kg C ha–1, during the 40 days measurement period. This difference in CO2-C emission was partitioned between residue decomposition and humus mineralization. Carbon mineralized from humus was 270 kg C ha–1 higher under plow tillage than under no tillage. This figure represented an important extra loss of 0.48% of the soil organic carbon content from the 0–30 cm depth, as consequence of plowing in the warmest season of the year.

TI  - Non‐inversion tillage and farmland birds: a review with special reference to the UK and Europe
PY  - 2004
AB  - This paper reviews the current knowledge of the effects of non-inversion tillage (NIT) on farmland birds and their food resources. NIT is a method of establishing a crop without using a mouldboard plough and is becoming increasingly popular in the UK. NIT generally disturbs the soil to shallower depths than conventional tillage and is therefore expected to have beneficial effects on biodiversity on arable land as compared with mouldboard ploughing. The diets of farmland birds change throughout the year, and many species take invertebrates over the breeding season. Seeds are also important for many species of farmland birds throughout the year and especially over the winter months. The effects of NIT on these farmland bird food resources, in particular ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), spiders (Arachnida: Araneae), earthworms (Annelida) and seeds (arable weeds and cereal crops) are reviewed.

TI  - Effects of climate and management intensity on nitrous oxide emissions in grassland systems across Europe
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Soil/atmosphere exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide were monitored for a 3-year period at 10 grassland sites in eight European countries (Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom), spanning a wide range of climatic, environmental and soil conditions. Most study sites investigated the influence of one or several management practices on N2O exchange, such as nitrogen fertilization and grazing intensity. Fluxes were measured using non-steady state chambers at most sites, and alternative measurement techniques such as eddy covariance and fast-box using tunable diode laser spectroscopy were implemented at some sites. The overall uncertainty in annual flux estimates derived from chamber measurements may be as high as 50% due to the temporal and spatial variability in fluxes, which warrants the future use of continuous measurements, if possible at the field scale. Annual emission rates were higher from intensive than from extensive grasslands, by a factor 4 if grazed (1.77 versus 0.48 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) and by a factor 3 if ungrazed (0.95 versus 0.32 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Annual emission factors for fertilized systems were highly variable, ranging from 0.01% to 3.56%, but the mean emission factor across all sites (0.75%) was substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1.25%. Emission factors for individual fertilization events increased with soil temperature and were generally higher for water-filled pore space values in the range 60–90%, though precipitation onto dry soils was also shown to lead to high losses of N2O-N from applied fertilizer. An empirical, multiple regression model to predict N2O emission factors on the basis of soil temperature, moisture and rainfall is developed, explaining half of the variability in observed emission factors.

TI  - Global environmental impacts of agricultural expansion: The need for sustainable and efficient practices
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract
The recent intensification of agriculture, and the prospects of future intensification, will have major detrimental impacts on the nonagricultural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the world. The doubling of agricultural food production during the past 35 years was associated with a 6.87-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization, a 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in the amount of irrigated cropland, and a 1.1-fold increase in land in cultivation. Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.

TI  - Conversion from agriculture to grassland builds soil organic matter on decadal timescales.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) often increases when agricultural fields are con- verted to perennial vegetation, yet decadal scale rates and the mechanisms that underlie SOM accumulation are not clear. We measured SOM accumulation and changes in soil properties on a replicated chronosequence of former agricultural fields in the midwestern United States that spanned 40 years after perennial-grassland establishment. Over this time period, soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top 10 cm of soil accumulated at a constant rate of 62.0 g·m 22 ·yr 21 , regardless of whether the vegetation type was dominated by C3 or C4 grasses. At this rate, SOC contents will be equivalent to unplowed native prairie sites within 55-75 years after cultivation ceased. Both labile (short turnover time) and recalcitrant (long turnover time) carbon pools increased linearly for 40 years, with recalcitrant pools increas- ing more rapidly than expected. This result was consistent across several different methods of measuring labile SOC. A model that investigates the mechanisms of SOM formation suggests that rapid formation of stable carbon resulted from biochemically resistant mi- crobial products and plant material. Former agricultural soils of the Great Plains may function as carbon sinks for less than a century, although much of the carbon stored is stable.

TI  - An approach to the genetics of nitrogen use efficiency in maize
PY  - 2004
AB  - To study the genetic variability and the genetic basis of nitrogen (N) use efficiency in maize, a set of recombinant inbred lines crossed with a tester was studied at low input (N-) and high input (N+) for grain yield and its components, grain protein content, and post-anthesis nitrogen uptake and remobilization. Other physiological traits, such as nitrate content, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate dehydrogenase activities were studied at the level of the lines. Genotypexnitrogen (GxN) interaction was significant for yield and explained by variation in kernel number. In N-, N-uptake, the nitrogen nutrition index, and GS activity in the vegetative stage were positively correlated with grain yield, whereas leaf senescence was negatively correlated. Whatever N-input, post-anthesis N-uptake was highly negatively related to N-remobilization. As a whole, genetic variability was expressed differently in N+ and N-. This was confirmed by the detection of QTLs. More QTLs were detected in N+ than in N- for traits of vegetative development, N-uptake, and grain yield and its components, whereas it was the reverse for grain protein content and N-utilization efficiency. Several coincidences between genes encoding for enzymes of N metabolism and QTLs for the traits studied were observed. In particular, coincidences in three chromosome regions of QTLs for yield and N-remobilization, QTLs for GS activity and a gene encoding cytosolic GS were observed. This may have a physiological meaning. The GS locus on chromosome 5 appears to be a good candidate gene which can, at least partially, explain the variation in nitrogen use efficiency.

TI  - Differences in the nitrogen use efficiency of perennial ryegrass varieties under simulated rotational grazing and their effects on nitrogen recovery and herbage nitrogen content
PY  - 2000
AB  - Eight varieties of perennial ryegrass (six new varieties and two old ones) grown at five levels of applied fertilizer (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 kg of N ha–1) were cut monthly during two growing seasons (March to October in 1997 and 1998) and their herbage dry-matter (DM) yield and nitrogen (N) content were determined. Herbage leaf content and the N content of young fully expanded leaves were also measured in 1997, and monthly recovery of applied N was determined in both the first and second harvest years by using 15N.



The rank order of varieties was similar for annual yield of DM and N at all five fertilizer levels. Proportional differences between varieties in DM yield were greatest in the first cut of each year, the late-heading candidate variety Ba12151 out-yielding the old late-heading variety S23 by more than 70%. However, differences in annual DM yield were much more modest than in early spring yield, up to 10% in 1997 and up to 21% in 1998. The relatively small differences in total annual DM yield were attributed to only a small proportion of the applied N being recovered during a single regrowth period, most of the remainder becoming available for uptake in subsequent regrowth periods.



There were small but highly statistically significant differences among varieties in the N content of their leaves, leaf N content being inversely related to yield of DM and N. This lends further support to the hypothesis that the metabolic cost of protein synthesis and turnover is a key factor controlling genetic variation both in leaf yield and in annual DM and N yield under frequent harvesting. Seasonal variation in herbage N content was much greater than differences among varieties in mean N content over all harvests. In May of both years at all applied fertilizer levels, herbage N content fell below the 20 g N kg–1 DM level required by productive grazing animals.

TI  - Regionalised inventory of biogenic greenhouse gas emissions from European agriculture
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract This study develops a detailed methodology compatible to the Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the annual direct biogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) released from European agriculture. This approach relies on emission factors and regression equations derived from all long-term measurements in Europe available by the end of 2001. Applying the methodology, the biogenic GHG emissions from agriculture within the European Union (EU) and within its Member States are calculated for the period from 1975 to 1997 at a spatial resolution of regions or federal states (NUTS 1–2 level). As a result, in 1995, European agriculture emitted 0.84±0.19 Tg N 2 O, 8.1±2.0 Tg CH 4 and 39 Tg±25 CO 2 , which adds up to 470±80 Tg CO 2 -equivalents or 11% of the overall GHG emissions. At the EU level, these numbers are surprisingly close to the official inventory submitted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). But compared with the latter, the approach taken here leads to higher agricultural CH 4 emissions in Austria and the Netherlands, at least 20% lower CH 4 emissions in Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain and Sweden and higher N 2 O emissions in most EU Member States. In countries with—even small—areas of farmed organic soils, CO 2 emitted from peat oxidation can significantly contribute to the overall emissions. Hence, only the detailed approach adequately resolves regional and national specifics of agricultural conditions. It furthermore reduces the uncertainty in the emissions estimates to half of the one in inventories based on the IPCC Guidelines. Fair agreement with inverse atmospheric models was achieved. These results suggest that the methodology developed and applied here could serve as a significantly improved standard for official inventories of biogenic GHG emissions from EU Member States.

TI  - Polyphenol Oxidase and o‐Diphenols Inhibit Postharvest Proteolysis in Red Clover and Alfalfa
PY  - 2006
AB  - Many forages experience significant proteolytic losses when preserved by ensiling. Such losses in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) are especially high, with degradation of 44 to 87% of the forage protein to nonprotein N (NPN). In contrast, red clover {Trifolium pratense L.) has up to 90% less proteolysis during ensiling. Here we demonstrate that the combination of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and o-diphenol PPO substrates, both abundantly present in red clover, is responsible for postharvest proteolytic inhibition in this forage crop. Proteolysis in red clover leaf extracts increased nearly fivefold when endogenous o-diphenols were removed by gel filtration but returned to starting levels by adding back an exogenous o-diphenol. Proteolysis in leaf extracts of red clover plants silenced for PPO expression was dramatically increased compared to control plants. Leaf extracts of transgenic alfalfa expressing a red clover PPO gene showed a nearly fivefold o-diphenol-dependent decrease in proteolysis compared to those of control alfalfa. We also demonstrate that PPO levels 10- to 20-fold lower than those typically found in red clover are sufficient for proteolytic inhibition, that as little as 0.25 μmol o-diphenol mg -1 protein has a substantial impact on proteolysis, that a wide variety of o-diphenols are functional substrates in proteolytic inhibition, and that proteolysis is reduced for PPO-expressing alfalfa in small-scale ensiling experiments. Together, these results indicate that PPO and o-diphenols can be an effective treatment to prevent protein loss in ensiled forage crops.

TI  - A review of nitrogen fertilizer and conservation tillage effects on soil organic carbon storage
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer and tillage systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage have been tested in many field experiments worldwide. The published results of this research are here compiled for evaluation of the impact of management practices on carbon sequestration. Paired data from 137 sites with varying nitrogen rates and 161 sites with contrasting tillage systems were included. Nitrogen fertilizer increased SOC but only when crop residues were returned to the soil; a multiple regression model accounted for just over half the variance (R2=0.56, P=0.001). The model included as independent variables: cumulative nitrogen fertilizer rate; rainfall; temperature; soil texture; and a cropping intensity index, calculated as a combination of the number of crops per year and percentage of corn in the rotation. Carbon sequestration increased as more nitrogen was applied to the system, and as rainfall or cropping intensity increased. At sites with higher mean temperatures and also in fine textured soils, carbon sequestration decreased. When the carbon costs of production, transportation and application of fertilizer are subtracted from the carbon sequestration predicted by the model, it appears that nitrogen fertilizer-use in tropical regions results in no additional carbon sequestration, whereas in temperate climates, it appears to promote net carbon sequestration. No differences in SOC were found between reduced till (chisel, disc, and sweep till) and no-till, whereas conventional tillage (mouldboard plough, disc plough) was associated with less SOC. The accumulation of SOC under conservation tillage (reduced and no till) was an S-shape time dependent process, which reached a steady state after 25–30 years, but this relationship only accounted for 26% of the variance. Averaging out SOC differences in all the experiments under conservation tillage, there was an increase of 2.1 t C ha−1 over ploughing. However, when only those cases that had apparently reached equilibrium were included (all no till vs. conventional tillage comparisons from temperate regions), mean SOC increased by approximately 12 t C ha−1. This estimate is larger than others previously reported. Carbon sequestration under conservation tillage was not significantly related to climate, soil texture or rotation.

TI  - Nitrogen fertilizer: Retrospect and prospect
PY  - 1999
AB  - The rising fertilizer use accompanying more people eating more has been called exponential (1) and prompted fears of polluted water and consequent methemoglobinemia (2) and hypoxia (3). It also has raised alarm about greenhouse warming (4) and an altered global N cycle and thus primary production (5) and diversity (1) of vegetation. In this plethora of issues we concentrate on a few, beginning with the fundamental one of how fast N fertilizer use has risen in the world and in an industrial nation, the United States, where early, rapid adoption may foretell the course in the world. We also shall explore how much deposition of N from the atmosphere has increased. After examining the changing ratio of fertilizer N application to its intended incorporation in crop yield, we shall discuss prospects for more or less N fertilizer by 2070 when the earth’s farmers may be feeding 10 billion people and sparing more or less habitat for nature.

Because nitrogen (N) comprises fully 16% of protein, neither we, other animals, nor plants grow and survive unless roots extract it from the soil. Medieval wheat crops of only 1,000 kg hectare (ha)−1 extracted 21 kg of N (6). Some N deposited by precipitation or fixed by legumes helped replenish the supply. By rotating their wheat crops onto one of the other, say, 4 ha of the farm or collecting manure from it, medieval farmers could complete the replacement of the N annually removed by 1 ha of wheat. The farm could sustain only a few people because N inevitably escapes from the cycle of deposition, fixation, crops, and animals, and each person requires at least 3 kg of N per year (7).

During the 19th century, mining Chilean nitrate and Peruvian guano somewhat relieved this …

TI  - Greenhouse gas mitigation in agriculture
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural lands occupy 37% of the earth's land surface. Agriculture accounts for 52 and 84% of global anthropogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agricultural soils may also act as a sink or source for CO2, but the net flux is small. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management and restoration of degraded lands and cultivated organic soils. Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management. The global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030, considering all gases, is estimated to be approximately 5500–6000 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1, with economic potentials of approximately 1500–1600, 2500–2700 and 4000–4300 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1 at carbon prices of up to 20, up to 50 and up to 100 US$ t CO2-eq.−1, respectively. In addition, GHG emissions could be reduced by substitution of fossil fuels for energy production by agricultural feedstocks (e.g. crop residues, dung and dedicated energy crops). The economic mitigation potential of biomass energy from agriculture is estimated to be 640, 2240 and 16 000 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1 at 0–20, 0–50 and 0–100 US$ t CO2-eq.−1, respectively.

TI  - Effect of long-term conservation tillage on soil biochemical properties in Mediterranean Spanish areas
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract In semi-arid Mediterranean areas, studies of the performance of conservation tillage systems have largely demonstrated advantages in crop yield, soil water storage and soil protection against wind and water erosion. However, little attention has been given to interactions between soil biochemical properties under different tillage practices. Biochemical properties are useful tools to assess changes caused by different soil tillage systems in long-term field experiments. This study deals with the effect of long-term tillage practices (reduced tillage and no-tillage vs. traditional tillage) on soil chemical properties and microbial functions in three different sites of Spain (two of them located in the Northeast and one in the Southwest) under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. Soil biological status, as index of soil quality, was evaluated by measuring microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase (an oxidoreductase) and protease (a hydrolase) activities at three soil depths (0–5, 5–10 and 10–25 cm). In the three experimental areas, increases in soil organic matter content, MBC and enzymatic activities were found at the superficial layers of soil under conservation tillage (reduced tillage and no-tillage) in comparison with traditional tillage. Values of the stratification ratio of some biochemical properties were significantly correlated with yield production in Northeast sites. Conservation tillage has proven to be an effective strategy to improve soil quality and fertility in Mediterranean areas of Spain.

TI  - Nitrous oxide production and denitrification in Scottish arable soils
PY  - 1991
AB  - SUMMARY

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and concentrations in the soil atmosphere were measured at a number of sites of differing soil type in south-east Scotland between 1985 and 1988. Concentrations followed log-normal distributions and were significantly affected by soil type, tillage treatment, and nitrate application rate. The shape of the profiles suggested significant consumption in the upper 5 cm, making calculations of emission rates using Fick's Law unsatisfactory. Emission rates measured using closed flux chambers were at least one order of magnitude smaller from heavier-textured arable soils than from lighter ones.



Denitrification fluxes measured by field application of the acetylene inhibition technique were lowest in a clay loam, and highest in an alluvial sandy loam; this was attributed to a failure to achieve a satisfactory distribution of acetylene in the heavier soil. Denitrification rates in soil cores generally exceeded measured surface fluxes; incubation at decreased oxygen concentrations typical of those measured in the field produced a further significant increase. Core incubation should be used as an alternative to in situ field measurement only if the oxygen concentration in the incubation vessels is adjusted to mimic that in the field; otherwise denitrification rates may be significantly underestimated.

TI  - MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND SOIL STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH CORN, GRASSES, AND LEGUMES
PY  - 1991
AB  - Maintaining long-term soil productivity requires development of cropping systems that provide maintenance or improvement in soil structure and an understanding of associated rhizosphere microbial populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of several crops on soil biomass C and biomass N contents, their within-season variability, and the relationships between changes in soil biomass C, biomass N, and soil structure on a Brookston clay loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Argiaquoll). Soil microbial biomass C, biomass N, and soil-structure parameters (wet aggregate stability [WAS], organic carbon [OC], dry aggregate mean weight diameter [MWD], bulk density, and total and air-filled porosity) were measured during the third year of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max [L.], Merr.) alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and no-crop (bare, covered, and shaded) plots at monthly intervals (June, July, August, and September). Reed canarygrass resulted in greater biomass-C contents than both the corn and soybean at all four sampling dates. Soil biomass C under alfalfa was significantly greater than under corn and soybean for both the first and last sampling dates. Forage species did not affect the soil biomass-N content. No consistent effects of the no-crop treatment on biomass C or biomass N were observed between sampling dates. Biomass C was significantly correlated with WAS, OC, and MWD for the cropping treatments. Wet aggregate stability was negatively correlated with soil water content for both the no-crop and cropping treatments, indicating that improvements in structure were not solely the result of the cropping treatments and associated rhizosphere populations. Reed canarygrass resulted in greater soil biomass C/N than the alfalfa, corn, and orchard grass plots, suggesting that fungal activity, and therefore soil structure, may be preferentially enhanced in the presence of reed canarygrass. This study demonstrated the influence of forage species and seasonal variability on concurrent changes in microbial biomass and soil structural properties.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from a Northern Great Plains soil as influenced by nitrogen management and cropping systems.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Field measurements of N 2 O emissions from soils are limited for cropping systems in the semiarid notthern Great Plains (NGP). The objectives were to develop N 2 O emission-time profiles for cropping systems in the semiarid NGP, define important periods of loss, determine the impact of best management practices on N 2 O losses, and estimate direct N fertilizer-induced emissions (FIE). No-till (NT) wheat (Triticum Aestivum L)-fallow, wheat-wheat, and wheat-pea (Pisum sativum), and conventional till (CT) wheat-fallow, all with three N regimes (200 and 100 kg N ha -1 available N, unferatilized control); plus a perennial grass: alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) system were sampled over 2 yr using vented chambers. Cumulative 2-yr N 2 O emissions were modest in contrast to reports from more humid regions. Greatest N 2 O flux activity occurred fullowing urea-N fertilization (10-wk) and during freeze-thaw cycles. Together these periods comprised up to 84% of the 2-yr total. Nitrification was probably the dominant process responsible for N 2 O emissions during the post-N fertilization period, while denitrification was more important during freeze-thaw cycles. Cumulative 2-yr N 2 O-N losses from fertilized regimes were greater for wheat-wheat (1.31 kg N ha -1 ) than wheat-fallow (CT and NT) (0.48 kg N ha -1 ), and wheat-pea (0.71 kg N ha -1 ) due to an additional N fertilization event. Cumulative losses from unfertilized cropping systems were not different from perennial grass-alfalfa (0.28 kg N ha -1 ). Tillage did not affect N 2 O losses for the wheat-fallow systems. Mean FIE level was equivalent to 0.26% of applied N, and considerably below the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change mean default value (1.25%).

TI  - Nitrogen oxide and methane emissions under varying tillage and fertilizer management.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Comprehensive assessment of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) budget of reduced tillage agricultural systems must consider emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), each of which have higher global warming potentials than carbon dioxide (CO2). Tillage intensity may also impact nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which can have various environmental and agronomic impacts. In 2003 and 2004, we used chambers to measure N2O, CH4, and NO fluxes from plots that had been managed under differing tillage intensity since 1991. The effect of tillage on non-CO2 GHG emissions varied, in both magnitude and direction, depending on fertilizer practices. Emissions of N2O following broadcast urea (BU) application were higher under no till (NT) and conservation tillage (CsT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). In contrast, following anhydrous ammonia (AA) injection, N2O emissions were higher under CT and CsT compared to NT. Emissions following surface urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) application did not vary with tillage. Total growing season non-CO2 GHG emissions were equivalent to CO2 emissions of 0.15 to 1.9 Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) or 0.04 to 0.53 Mg soil-C ha(-1) yr(-1). Emissions of N2O from AA-amended plots were two to four times greater than UAN- and BU-amended plots. Total NO + N2O losses in the UAN treatment were approximately 50% lower than AA and BU. This study demonstrates that N2O emissions can represent a substantial component of the total GHG budget of reduced tillage systems, and that interactions between fertilizer and tillage practices can be important in controlling non-CO2 GHG emissions.

TI  - Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from Canadian animal agriculture: A review
PY  - 2006
AB  - Considerable evidence of climate change associated with emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) has resulted in international efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The agriculture sector contributes about 8% of GHG emissions in Canada mostly through methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The objective of this paper was to compile an integrative review of CH4 and N2O emissions from livestock by taking a whole cycle approach from enteric fermentation to manure treatment and storage, and field application of manure. Basic microbial processes that result in CH4 production in the rumen and hindgut of animals were reviewed. An overview of CH4 and N2O production processes in manure, and controlling factors are presented. Most of the studies conducted in relation to enteric fermentation were in dairy and beef cattle. To date, research has focussed on GHG emissions from the stored manures of dairy, beef cattle and swine; therefore, we focus our review on these. Several methods used to measure GHG emissions from livestock a...

TI  - Measuring Adsorption Isotherms Using Continuous, Unsaturated Flow through Intact Soil Cores
PY  - 1992
AB  - Conventional batch adsorption-isotherm experiments are conducted under conditions that are generally not representative of field conditions. Our objective was to develop and illustrate a technique that uses continuous, Unsaturated flow through intact soil cores and gives information analogous to standard batch absorption experiments. Soil cores were placed on filter funnels and continuous flow was induced by controlled vacuum. Solution, 10 times the weight of the soil, was applied and recycled until apparent equilibrium concentrations were observed. While the total solution-to-soil ratio was 10:1, the amount in contact with soil at any instant was small. The procedure was replicated on separate cores with different initial solute concentrations to give different final equilibrium concentrations as a function of solute adsorbed per gram of soil. The technique was illustrated by observing adsorption of forest floor dissolved organic C to cores of AB horizon soil, and was compared with conventional batch adsorption data. Isotherms using both methods were linear but the slope of the batch isotherm was somewhat less. This flowthrough technique provides a way to obtain adsorption-isotherm data under more realistic

TI  - Soil organic matter, biota and aggregation in temperate and tropical soils - Effects of no-tillage
PY  - 2002
AB  - The long-term stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) in tropical and temperate regions is mediated by soil biota (e.g. fungi, bacte- ria, roots and earthworms), soil structure (e.g. aggregation) and their interactions. On average, soil C turnover was twice as fast in tropical com- pared with temperate regions, but no major differences were observed in SOM quality between the two regions. Probably due to the soil mineralogy dominated by 1:1 clay minerals and oxides in tropical regions, we found a higher aggregate stability, but a lower correlation between C contents and aggregate stability in tropical soils. In addition, a smaller amount of C associated with clay and silt particles was observed in tro- pical versus temperate soils. In both tropical and temperate soils, a general increase in C levels (≈ 325 ± 113 kg C·ha -1 ·yr -1 ) was observed under no-tillage compared with conventional tillage. On average, in temperate soils under no-tillage, compared with conventional tillage, CH4 uptake (≈ 0.42 ± 0.10 kg C-CH4·ha -1 ·yr -1

TI  - Towards food, feed and energy crops mitigating climate change.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Agriculture is an important source of anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and crops can affect the microbial processes controlling these emissions in many ways. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of plant–microbe interactions in relation to the CH 4 and N 2 O budgets and show how this is promoting new generations of crop cultivars that have the potential to mitigate GHG emissions for future agricultural use. The possibility of breeding low GHG-emitting cultivars is a paradigm shift towards sustainable agriculture that balances climate change and food and bioenergy security.

TI  - Influence of tillage system on denitrification in maize-cropped soils
PY  - 1997
AB  - Denitrification losses show an irregular pattern through the year, often being caused by climatic conditions and management practices. The objectives of the present work were to quantify denitrification losses and to determine the influence of tillage system on the factors that control denitrification in fertilized soils. The modal profile of the soil was an Vertic Argiudoll, clay loam texture, located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The treatments were: (a) fertilized, (b) incorporated fertilization and (c) without fertilization for both no tillage and conventional tillage systems. Chambers were placed in the field to measure denitrification. In this clayish soil the estimated mean values of accumulated denitrification during the crop cycle (90 days) were 0.190kgNha–1 for conventional tillage and 0.350kgNha–1 for no tillage. In treatments with no tillage, losses by denitrification were approximately twice those of conventional tillage. These differences were also evidenced by the number of microorganisms, which were significantly higher (P ;5%) for no tillage on all dates, except for at flowering. The increase at flowering coincided with the period of highest rainfall and consequently the highest water contents in the soil. The highest denitrification losses, except for sowing, were measured when soil moisture content was more than 30% (v/v). Denitrification increased in conjunction with an increase in the availability of carbon that is consumed by the heterotrophic microorganisms (including the denitrifiers).

TI  - Long-term effects of tillage systems and rotations on soil structural stability and organic carbon stratification in semiarid central Spain
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Under semiarid Mediterranean climatic conditions, soils typically have low organic matter content and weak structure resulting in low infiltration rates. Aggregate stability is a quality indicator directly related to soil organic matter, which can be redistributed within soil by tillage. Long-term effects (1983–1996) of tillage systems on water stability of pre-wetted and air dried aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC) stratification and crop production were studied in a Vertic Luvisol with a loam texture. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) under winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and vetch ( Vicia sativa L.) rotation (W–V), and under continuous monoculture of winter wheat or winter barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) (CM). Aggregate stability of soil at a depth of 0–5 cm was much greater when 1–2 mm aggregates were vacuum wetted prior to sieving (83%) than when slaked (6%). However, slaking resulted in tillage effects that were consistent with changes in SOC. Aggregate stability of slaked aggregates was greater under ZT than under CT or MT in both crop rotations (i.e., 11% vs. 3%, respectively). SOC under ZT tended to accumulate in the surface soil layer (0–5 and 5–10 cm) at the expense of deeper ones. At depths of 10–20 and 20–30 cm no differences in SOC were encountered among tillage systems, but CT exhibited the highest concentration at 30–40 cm depth. Nevertheless, when comparisons were made on mass basis (Mg ha −1 ), significant differences in stocked SOC were observed at depths of 0–10 and 0–20 cm, where ZT had the highest SOC content in both rotations. The stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm, averaged across crop rotations, was greater under ZT (43 Mg ha −1 ) than under CT (41 Mg ha −1 ) and MT (40 Mg ha −1 ) although these figures were not significantly different. Likewise, no significant differences were encountered in the stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm among crop rotations (i.e., 42 Mg ha −1 for W–V vs. 40 Mg ha −1 for CM). Crop production with wheat–vetch and continuous cereal showed no differences among tillage systems. Yields were strongly limited by the environmental conditions, particularly the amount of rainfall received in the crop growth season and its distribution. Similar yield and improved soil properties under ZT suggests that it is a more sustainable system for the semiarid Mediterranean region of Spain.

TI  - Relationships between farm productivity, profitability, N leaching and GHG emissions: a modelling approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - <jats:p>The financial and environmental performance of a typical dairy and sheep/beef farm under contrasting inputs and systems were modelled to test associations between productivity, profitability, nitrogen (N) leaching and green house gas (GHG) emissions. GHG emissions and N leaching were found to be closely correlated (R2 &gt; 0.90) but the correlation between these two emissions items and production and/or profit was less so, suggesting that systems that are both profitable and have a modest emissions output should be possible. The reasons why farmers have not already adopted these systems are complex but could include any of: requirement of higher level of managerial skill, incompatibility with farm soil type or contour, increased risk and capital cost to convert to the new system. Any system that involves improvements in animal efficiency is associated with a reduction in emissions per kg of saleable product.

TI  - Postharvest nitrous oxide emissions from a subtropical oxisol as influenced by summer crop residues and their management
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas and soil management systems should be evaluated for their N2O mitigation potential. This research evaluated a long-term (22 years) experiment testing the effect of soil management systems on N2O emissions in the postharvest period (autumn) from a subtropical Rhodic Hapludox at the research center FUNDACEP, in Cruz Alta, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Three treatments were evaluated, one under conventional tillage with soybean residues (CTsoybean) and two under no-tillage with soybean (NTsoybean) and maize residues (NTmaize). N2O emissions were measured eight times within 24 days (May 2007) using closed static chambers. Gas flows were obtained based on the relations between gas concentrations in the chamber at regular intervals (0, 15, 30, 45 min) analyzed by gas chromatography. After soybean harvest, accumulated N2O emissions in the period were approximately three times higher in the untilled soil (164 mg m-2 N) than under CT (51 mg m-2 N), with a short-lived N2O peak of 670 mg m-2 h-1 N. In contrast, soil N2O emissions in NT were lower after maize than after soybean, with a N2O peak of 127 g m-2 h-1 N. The multivariate analysis of N2O fluxes and soil variables, which were determined simultaneously with air sampling, demonstrated that the main driving variables of soil N2O emissions were soil microbial activity, temperature, water-filled pore space, and NO3- content. To replace soybean monoculture, crop rotation including maize must be considered as a strategy to decrease soil N2O emissions from NT soils in Southern Brazil in a Autumn.

TI  - Tillage-induced changes to soil structure and organic carbon fractions in New Zealand soils
PY  - 2001
AB  - The effects of increasing cropping and soil compaction on aggregate stability and dry-sieved aggregate-size distribution, and their relationship to total organic C (TOC) and the major functional groups of soil organic carbon, were investigated on 5 soils of contrasting mineralogy. All soils except the allophanic soil showed a significant decline in aggregate stability under medium- to long-term cropping. Mica-rich, fine-textured mineral and humic soils showed the greatest increase in the mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregates, while the oxide-rich soils, and particularly the allophanic soils, showed only a slight increase in the MWD after long-term cropping. On conversion back to pasture, the aggregate stability of the mica-rich soils increased and the MWD of the aggregate-size distribution decreased, with the humic soil showing the greatest recovery. Aggregate stability and dry aggregate-size distribution patterns show that soil resistance to structural degradation and soil resilience increased from fine-textured to coarse-textured to humic mica-rich soils to oxide-rich soils to allophanic soils. Coarse- and fine-textured mica-rich and oxide-rich soils under pasture contained medium amounts of TOC, hot-water soluble carbohydrate (WSC), and acid hydrolysable carbohydrate (AHC), all of which declined significantly under cropping. The rate of decline varied with soil type in the initial years of cropping, but was similar under medium- and long-term cropping. TOC was high in the humic mica-rich and allophanic soils, and levels did not decline appreciably under medium- and long-term cropping. 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance evidence also indicates that all major functional groups of soil organic carbon declined under cropping, with O-alkyl C and alkyl C showing the fastest and slowest rate of decline, respectively. On conversion back to pasture, both WSC and AHC returned to levels originally present under long-term pasture. TOC recovered to original pasture levels in the humic soil, but recovered only to 60–70% of original levels in the coarse- and fine-textured soils. Aggregate stability was strongly correlated to TOC, WSC, and AHC (P < 0.001), while aggregate-size distribution was moderately correlated to aggregate stability (P < 0.01) and weakly correlated to AHC (P < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy indicated a loss of the binding agents around aggregates under cropping. The effect of the loss of these binding agents on soil structure was more pronounced in mica-rich soils than in oxide-rich and allophanic soils. The very high aggregate stabilities of the humic soil under pasture was attributed to the presence of a protective water-repellent lattice of long-chain polymethylene compounds around the soil aggregates.

TI  - Implications of climate change for grassland in Europe: impacts, adaptations and mitigation options: a review
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary
Climate change associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may have important implications for Europe's grasslands. Projected scenarios indicate that increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations have the potential to increase herbage growth and to favour legumes more than grasses, but changes in seasonal precipitation would reduce these benefits particularly in areas with low summer rainfall. Further implications for grasslands may arise from increased frequency of droughts, storms and other extreme events. Potential farm-scale adaptive responses to climate change are identified. Grassland agriculture also contributes to GHG emissions, particularly methane and nitrous oxide, and management of grassland affects net carbon balances and carbon sequestration. Management options are identified for mitigating grassland's contribution to GHG emissions which need to be developed in a holistic way that also considers other pressures.

TI  - Nitrogen, Tillage, and Crop Rotation Effects on Carbon Dioxide and Methane Fluxes from Irrigated Cropping Systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Long-term effects of tillage intensity, N fertilization, and crop rotation on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) flux from semiarid irrigated soils are poorly understood. We evaluated effects of; (i) tillage intensity [no-till (NT) and conventional moldboard plow tillage (CT)] in a continuous corn rotation; (ii) N fertilization levels [0-246 kg N ha -1 for corn (Zea mays L.); 0 and 56 kg N ha -1 for dry bean (Phasealus vulgaris L.); 0 and 112 kg N ha -1 for barley (Hordeum distichon L.)]; and (iii) crop rotation under NT soil management [corn-barley (NT-CB); continuous corn (NT-CC); corn-dry bean (NT-CDb)] on CO 2 and CH 4 flux from a clay loam soil. Carbon dioxide and CH 4 fluxes were monitored one to three times per week using vented nonsteady state closed chambers. No-till reduced (14%) growing season (154 d) cumulative CO 2 emissions relative to CT (NT: 2.08 Mg CO 2 -C ha -1 ; CT: 2.41 Mg CO 2 -C ha -1 ), while N fertilization had no effect. Significantly lower (18%) growing season CO 2 fluxes were found in NT-CDb than NT-CC and NT-CB (11.4, 13.2 and 13.9 kg CO 2 -C ha -1 d -1 respectively). Growing season CH 4 emissions were higher in NT (20.2 g CH 4 ha -1 ) than in CT (1.2 g CH 4 ha -1 ). Nitrogen fertilization and cropping rotation did not affect CH 4 flux. Implementation of NT for 7 yr with no N fertilization was not adequate for restoring the CH 4 oxidation capacity of this clay loam soil relative to CT plowed and fertilized soil.

TI  - Conservation tillage.
PY  - 1985
AB  - Conservation production systems combine tillage and planting practices to reduce soil erosion and loss of water from farmland. Successful conservation tillage practices depend on the ability of farm managers to integrate sound crop production practices with effective pest management systems. More scientific information is needed to determine the relations between tillage practices and physical, chemical, and biological soil factors that affect plant and pest ecology. There is a need to devise improved pest management strategies for conservation tillage and to better understand the impact of conservation tillage on water-quality, especially as it is related to use of agricultural chemicals. While savings in fuel, labor, and soil have induced many farmers to adopt conservation tillage, improved methods and equipment should increase adoption even more.

TI  - Tillage effects on carbon fluxes in continuous wheat and fallow-wheat rotations.
PY  - 2000
AB  - The traditional cropping system in semiarid regions of the Canadian prairies involves frequent summer fallowing with several tillage operations to control weeds during the fallow period. Recently, there has been a trend toward reduced tillage and more intensive cropping, but the impact of this shift in management on sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 remains uncertain. In 1995 and 1996, we measured fluxes of CO 2 in a tillage experiment that had been initiated in 1982 on a silt loam (Typic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan. The experiment comprised two spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations (continuous wheat [Cont. W] and fallow-wheat [F-W]), each with conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) treatments. In Cont. W, CO 2 fluxes tended to be lower under NT than under CT (mean annual flux was 20 to 25% less for NT than CT). In F-W, tillage effects on mean annual CO 2 flux were significant (P < 0.05) in the wheat phase only (NT 10% less than CT). Tillage had negligible effect on C inputs in crop residues. lower CO 2 fluxes under NT than under CT were attributed to slower decomposition of crop residues placed on the surface of NT soil than when they were incorporated. With good growing conditions (and thus large inputs of residues) between 1989 and 1996, there was an accumulation of partially decomposed residues on the surface of NT soil. Carbon in surface residues represented about one-half of the C gained by NT soil. In Cont. W, surface residue C (in 1996) amounted to 3.6 t ha -1 under NT vs 1.4 t ha -1 under CT. Residue C amounts were smaller in the F-W system: 1.7 t ha -1 (NT) and 0.7 t ha -1 (CT). Based on our results, producers on medium-textured soils in the semiarid Canadian prairies who switch from the traditional wheat production system (conventionally tilled fallow-wheat) to continuous no-till cropping could, potentially, sequester 5 to 6 t C ha -1 in soil organic matter and surface residues in 13 to 14 yr.

TI  - Water infiltration and soil structure related to organic matter and its stratification with depth
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Soil organic matter is a key attribute of soil quality that impacts soil aggregation and water infiltration. Two soils (Typic Kanhapludults), one under long-term management of conventional tillage (CT) and one under long-term management of no tillage (NT), were sampled to a depth of 12 cm. Soil cores (15 cm diameter) were either left intact or sieved and repacked to differentiate between short-term (sieving) and long-term (tillage management) effects of soil disturbance on water infiltration, penetration resistance, soil bulk density, macroaggregate stability, and soil organic carbon (SOC). Mean weekly water infiltration was not different between sieved and intact cores from long-term CT (22 cm h −1 ), but was significantly greater in intact (72 cm h −1 ) than in sieved (28 cm h −1 ) soil from long-term NT. The stratification ratio of SOC (i.e., of 0–3 cm depth divided by that of 6–12 cm depth) was predictive of water infiltration rate, irrespective of short- or long-term history of disturbance. Although tillage is used to increase soil porosity, it is a short-term solution that has negative consequences on surface soil structural stability, surface residue accumulation, and surface-SOC, which are critical features that control water infiltration and subsequent water transmission and storage in soil. The stratification ratio of SOC could be used as a simple diagnostic tool to identify land management strategies that improve soil water properties (e.g., infiltration, water-holding capacity, and plant-available water).

TI  - Methane yields from Brahman cattle fed tropical grasses and legumes
PY  - 2012
AB  - In the national greenhouse inventory, methane emissions from the Australian tropical beef herd are derived from cattle fed two diets. In the experiments reported here, methane production was measured by open-circuit gas exchange from 13 Brahman cattle offered 22 diets from combinations of five tropical grass species and five legumes, with a minimum of three steers per diet. All diets were offered daily ad libitum, with the exception of three legume diets fed without grass and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) mixed with grass, which were offered at 15 g dry matter per kg liveweight. Diets were fed as long-chopped dried hay, with the exception of leucaena, which was harvested and fed within 2 days. For the data from cattle fed diets of grass and grass mixed with legumes, methane production could be predicted as 19.6 g/kg forage dry matter intake (residual standard deviation 12.3). Observed methane yields were not predictable from a stoichiometry, which used volatile fatty acid proportions in rumen fluid. Mean methane emission rates across all diets were equivalent to 8.6–13.4% of digestible energy intake, and 5.0–7.2% of gross energy intake. The latter values are comparable to IPCC (2006) recommendations (5.5–7.5%) for large ruminants fed low-quality crop residues and by-products. Methane yields per unit of ingested dry matter or digested organic matter were variable across diets but were related to digestibility and contents of fibre and protein. These results constitute a significant downward revision of the methane emissions attributable to the northern Australian beef herd grazing tropical pastures.

TI  - A Conceptual Model of Changes in Soil Structure Under Different Cropping Systems
PY  - 1988
AB  - There is much evidence that soil structure can be markedly affected by a farmer’s choice of cropping systems. For example, tillage type and intensity may substantially influence soil structure (for reviews see Cannell, 1985; Davies et al., 1982; R.S. Russell, 1977). The choice of crop may also result in significant alterations to soil structure. Many researchers have found deteriorations in soil structure under arable crops such as corn (Zea mays) (Page and Willard, 1946), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) (Doyle and Hamlyn, 1960), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) (Low, 1972). Improvements in soil structure have been observed under a number of ley and pasture grasses (see e.g., A.L. Clarke et al., 1967; Robinson and Jacques, 1958) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (Cooke and Williams, 1972). Figure 1 illustrates some measured changes in soil structure which can be attributed to different cropping systems. Harris et al. (1966) and E.W. Russell (1973) summarized much of the earlier research in this area.

TI  - Long-term tillage effects on soil carbon storage and carbon dioxide emissions in continuous corn cropping system from an alfisol in Ohio.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The experiment designed to quantify the effects of long-term tillage practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and CO2 emissions, was conducted on long-term tillage and continuous corn (Zea mays L.). The experimental plots were established in 1962 on a Crosby silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf) in Ohio. It consisted of moldboard plow till (MT) chisel till (CT), and no-till (NT) laid out in a randomized block design with four replications. After 43 yrs of continuous corn, the pool of SOC in the top 30 cm depth was significantly greater under NT (80.0 ± 3.7 Mg C ha−1) than under CT (45.3 ± 1.7 Mg C ha−1) and MT (44.8 ± 3.7 Mg C ha−1). A large proportion (68–74%) of SOC, in the 0–30 cm depth originated from corn residues (C4-C). On average, MT, CT and NT treatments sequestered C4-C in the top 30 cm at a rate of 0.73, 0.71 and 1.37 Mg ha−1 yr−1. The average daily CO2 fluxes (g CO2-C m−2 d−1) were greater under MT (2.14) and CT (2.07) than under NT (1.61). In addition, the daily CO2 fluxes were highest in summer (2.62–3.77 g CO2-C m−2 d−1), the lowest in winter (0.75–0.87 g CO2-C m−2 d−1), and were positively correlated with air (R2 = 0.78, P < 0.01) and soil temperatures in the top 20 cm (R2 = 0.76, P < 0.01) and negatively with soil water content (R2 = 0.57, P < 0.05). Tillage management had a significant influence on average daily CO2 fluxes during summer and autumn but not during winter and spring. Annual CO2 emissions calculated by extrapolating daily CO2 fluxes were significantly higher under MT (6.6 ± 0.3 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1) and CT (6.2 ± 0.4 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1) than under NT (5.5 ± 0.5 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1; LSD = 0.25 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1). These results indicated that, during the growing season, NT reduced CO2 emissions by an average of 0.7 and 0.6 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 compared to MT and CT, respectively.

TI  - The origin, composition and rates of organic nitrogen deposition: A missing piece of the nitrogen cycle?
PY  - 2002
AB  - Organic forms of nitrogen are widespread in the atmosphere and their deposition may constitute a substantive input of atmospheric N to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies have expanded the pool of available measurements and our awareness of their potential significance. Here, we use these measurements to provide a coherent picture of the processes that produce both oxidized and reduced forms of organic nitrogen in the atmosphere, examine how those processes are linked to human activity and how they may contribute to the N load from the atmosphere to ecosystems. We summarize and synthesize data from 41 measurements of the concentrations and fluxes of atmospheric organic nitrogen (AON). In addition, we examine the contribution of reduced organic nitrogen compounds such as amino acids, bacterial/particulate N, and oxidized compounds such as organic nitrates to deposition fluxes of AON. The percentage contribution of organic N to total N loading varies from site to site and with measurement methodology but is consistently around a third of the total N load with a median value of 30% (Standard Deviation of 16%). There are no indications that AON is a proportionally greater contributor to N deposition in unpolluted environments and there are not strong correlations between fluxes of nitrate and AON or ammonium and AON. Possible sources for AON include byproducts of reactions between NOx and hydrocarbons, marine and terrestrial sources of reduced (amino acid) N and the long-range transport of organic matter (dust, pollen etc.) and bacteria. Both dust and organic nitrates such as PAN appear to play an important role in the overall flux of AON to the surface of the earth. For estimates of organic nitrate deposition, we also use an atmospheric chemical transport model to evaluate the spatial distribution of fluxes and the globally integrated deposition values. Our preliminary estimate of the magnitude of global AON fluxes places the flux between 10 and 50 Tg of N per year with substantial unresolved uncertainties but clear indications that AON deposition is an important aspect of local and global atmospheric N budgets and deserves further consideration.

TI  - Effects of forage chicory (Cichorium intybus) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) on methane emissions in vitro and from sheep
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Published reports of CH4 yields as g CH4/kg dry matter (DM) intake suggest that emissions from sheep fed fresh forage chicory (Cichorium intybus) are about 30% lower than from those fed fresh ryegrass. In this study, 2 year old wethers (16; 54 ± 3.8 kg liveweight) were fed either mature chicory or perennial ryegrass at 1.3 times maintenance metabolisable energy requirements in the late spring/early summer of 2009. Methane emissions were determined using individual animal respiration chambers. Feeds differed in their chemical composition with chicory containing 856 g/kg organic matter (OM), 117 g/kg crude protein (CP) and 281 g/kg neutral detergent fibre (aNDF), whereas ryegrass contained 916 g/kg OM, 85 g/kg CP and 499 g/kg aNDF. The DM intake was similar for both forages at 0.76 kg/d, and CH4 yields did not differ between forages being 22.8 and 23.8 g CH4/kg DM intake for chicory and ryegrass, respectively. In vitro incubations of chicory and perennial ryegrass in the vegetative or mature states had similar CH4 yields. Despite large differences in chemical composition, especially aNDF, chicory and ryegrass had similar CH4 yields in vitro and in vivo. Chicory is not a viable alternative to perennial ryegrass for mitigating CH4 in pastoral based sheep production systems.

TI  - Measurement of Methane Production from Ruminants
PY  - 2007
AB  - : On a global scale agriculture and in particular enteric fermentation in ruminants is reported to produce about one fourth (21 to 25%) of the total anthropogenic emissions of methane (CH 4 ). Methane is produced during the anaerobic fermentation of hydrolyzed dietary carbohydrates in the rumen and represents an energy loss to the host besides contributing to emissions of greenhouse gases into the environment. However, there appears to be uncertainty in the CH 4 estimation from livestock due to the limited availability of data to document the variability at the farm level and also due to the significant impact of diet on the enteric CH 4 production. The methane mitigation strategies require robust prediction of emissions from rumen. There are many methods available which would be suitable for measuring CH 4 produced from the various stages of animal production. However, several factors need to be considered in order to select the most appropriate technique like the cost, level of accuracy required and the scale and design of the experiments to be undertaken. Selection of any technique depends on the accuracy as each one has its advantages and disadvantages. Screening of mitigation strategies may be evaluated using individual animal before large-scale trials on groups of animals are carried out. In this review various methods for the estimation of methane production from ruminants as well as for the determination of methane production potential of ruminant feeds are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods starting from respiration chamber, ventilated hood, facemask, sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) tracer technique, prediction equations and meteorological methods to in vitro methods are detailed.

Summary
The substantial stocks of carbon sequestered in temperate grassland ecosystems are located largely below ground in roots and soil. Organic C in the soil is located in discrete pools, but the characteristics of these pools are still uncertain. Carbon sequestration can be determined directly by measuring changes in C pools, indirectly by using 13C as a tracer, or by simulation modelling. All these methods have their limitations, but long-term estimates rely almost exclusively on modelling. Measured and modelled rates of C sequestration range from 0 to > 8 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. Management practices, climate and elevated CO2 strongly influence C sequestration rates and their influence on future C stocks in grassland soils is considered. Currently there is significant potential to increase C sequestration in temperate grassland systems by changes in management, but climate change and increasing CO2 concentrations in future will also have significant impacts. Global warming may negate any storage stimulated by changed management and elevated CO2, although there is increasing evidence that the reverse could be the case.

TI  - Estimation of Nitrous Oxide Emissions from US Grasslands.
PY  - 2000
AB  - O) emissions from temperate grasslands are poorly quantified and may be an important part of the atmospheric N2O budget. In this study N2O emissions were simulated for 1052 grassland sites in the United States using the NGAS model of Parton and others (1996) coupled with an organic matter decomposition model. N2O flux was calculated for each site using soil and land use data obtained from the National Resource Inventory (NRI) database and weather data obtained from NASA. The estimates were regionalized based upon temperature and moisture isotherms. Annual N2O emissions for each region were based on the grassland area of each region and the mean estimated annual N2O flux from NRI grassland sites in the region. The regional fluxes ranged from 0.18 to 1.02 kg N2O N/ha/yr with the mean flux for all regions being 0.28 kg N2O N/ha/yr. Even though fluxes from the western regions were relatively low, these regions made the largest contribution to total emissions due to their large grassland area. Total US grassland N2O emissions were estimated to be about 67 Gg N2O N/yr. Emissions from the Great Plains states, which contain the largest expanse of natural grassland in the United States, were estimated to average 0.24 kg N2O N/ha/yr. Using the annual flux estimate for the temperate Great Plains, we estimate that temperate grasslands worldwide may potentially produce 0.27 Tg N2O N/yr. Even though our estimate for global temperate grassland N2O emissions is less than published estimates for other major temperate and tropical biomes, our results indicate that temperate grasslands are a significant part of both United States and global atmospheric N2O budgets. This study demonstrates the utility of models for regional N2O flux estimation although additional data from carefully designed field studies is needed to further validate model results.

TI  - Impact of reduced tillage and cover cropping on the greenhouse gas budget of a maize/soybean rotation ecosystem
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Agricultural ecosystems have been viewed with the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) through reduced tillage and cover cropping practices. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, regarding the carbon (C) sink/source potential of these systems and few studies have examined C dynamics in conjunction with other important greenhouse gases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an alternative management scenario (reduced tillage and cover cropping) on ecosystem respiration ( R E ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes in a maize ( Zea mays L.)/soybean ( Glycine max L.) rotation ecosystem in east-central Minnesota, United States. The control treatment was managed using fall tillage with a chisel plow in combination with a tandem disk, and the experimental treatment was managed using strip tillage and a winter rye ( Secal cereale ) cover crop. Over the two-year study period (2004–2005), cumulative R E was 222.7 g C m −2 higher in the alternatively managed treatment as a result of increased decomposition of the cover crop residue. N 2 O fluxes were similar in both treatments during the 2004 growing season and were 100.1 mg N m −2 higher in the conventional treatment during the 2005 growing season after nitrogen (N) fertilization. N fertilization and fertilizer type were the dominant factors controlling N 2 O fluxes in both treatments. CH 4 fluxes were negligible in both treatments and often below the detection limit. Cumulative growing season N 2 O losses in the control and experimental treatments, which totalled 38.9 ± 3.1 and 26.1 ± 1.7 g C m −2 when converted to CO 2 equivalents, were comparable to the annual estimates of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange in both treatments. This study further supports that N 2 O losses are an important component of the total greenhouse gas budget of agroecosystems. It also suggests that spring cover cropping, without residue removal, has limited C sequestration potential. The results from this study, however, may not necessarily represent equilibrium conditions in the experimental treatment. Rather, they are a measure of the transient response of the system after tillage conversion and cover crop addition. It is expected that the soil microbes will continue to adjust to the reduction in tillage and increased C inputs. Therefore, continued, long-term monitoring is needed to confirm whether the results are representative of equilibrium conditions.

TI  - Greenhouse gas contributions of agricultural soils and potential mitigation practices in Eastern Canada
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract Agricultural soils can constitute either a net source or sink of the three principal greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). We compiled the most up-to-date information available on the contribution of agricultural soils to atmospheric levels of these gases and evaluated the mitigation potential of various management practices in eastern Canada and northeastern USA. Conversion of native ecosystems to arable cropping resulted in a loss of ∼22% of the original soil organic carbon (C)—a release of about 123 Tg C to the atmosphere; drainage and cultivation of organic soils resulted in an additional release of about 15 Tg C. Management practices that enhance C storage in soil include fertilization and legume- and forage-based rotations. Adopting no-till did not always increase soil C. This apparent absence of no-till effects on C storage was attributed to the type and depth of tillage, soil climatic conditions, the quantity and quality of residue C inputs, and soil fauna. Emission of N2O from soil increased linearly with the amount of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer applied (0.0119 kg N2O-N kg N−1). Application of solid manure resulted in substantially lower N2O emission (0.99 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) than application of liquid manure (2.83 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) or mineral fertilizer (2.82 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Systems containing legumes produced lower annual N2O emission than fertilized annual crops, suggesting that alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and other legume forage crops be considered different from other crops when deriving national inventories of greenhouse gases from agricultural systems. Plowing manure or crop stubble into the soil in the autumn led to higher levels of N2O production (2.41 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) than if residues were left on the soil surface (1.19 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Elevated N2O emission during freeze/thaw periods in winter and spring, suggests that annual N2O emission based only on growing-season measurements would be underestimated. Although measurements of CH4 fluxes are scant, it appears that agricultural soils in eastern Canada are a weak sink of CH4, and that this sink may be diminished through manuring. Although the influence of agricultural management on soil C storage and emission of greenhouse gases is significant, management practices often appear to involve offsets or tradeoffs, e.g., a particular practice may increase soil C storage but also increase emission of N2O. In addition, because of high variability, adequate spatial and temporal sampling are needed for accurate estimates of greenhouse gas flux and soil C stock. Therefore a full accounting of greenhouse gas contributions of agricultural soils is imperative for determining the true mitigation potential of management practices.

TI  - Methane emissions from cattle.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric concentrations of methane have led scientists to examine its sources of origin. Ruminant livestock can produce 250 to 500 L of methane per day. This level of production results in estimates of the contribution by cattle to global warming that may occur in the next 50 to 100 yr to be a little less than 2%. Many factors influence methane emissions from cattle and include the following: level of feed intake, type of carbohydrate in the diet, feed processing, addition of lipids or ionophores to the diet, and alterations in the ruminal microflora. Manipulation of these factors can reduce methane emissions from cattle. Many techniques exist to quantify methane emissions from individual or groups of animals. Enclosure techniques are precise but require trained animals and may limit animal movement. Isotopic and nonisotopic tracer techniques may also be used effectively. Prediction equations based on fermentation balance or feed characteristics have been used to estimate methane production. These equations are useful, but the assumptions and conditions that must be met for each equation limit their ability to accurately predict methane production. Methane production from groups of animals can be measured by mass balance, micrometeorological, or tracer methods. These techniques can measure methane emissions from animals in either indoor or outdoor enclosures. Use of these techniques and knowledge of the factors that impact methane production can result in the development of mitigation strategies to reduce methane losses by cattle. Implementation of these strategies should result in enhanced animal productivity and decreased contributions by cattle to the atmospheric methane budget.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions following application of residues and fertiliser under zero and conventional tillage
PY  - 2003
AB  - Emissions of N2O were measured following combined applications of inorganic N fertiliser and crop residues to a silt loam soil in S.E. England, UK. Effects of cultivation technique and residue application on N2O emissions were examined over 2 years. N2O emissions were increased in the presence of residues and were further increased where NH4NO3 fertiliser (200 kg N ha−1) was applied. Large fluxes of N2O were measured from the zero till treatments after residue and fertiliser application, with 2.5 kg N2O-N ha−1 measured over the first 23 days after application of fertiliser in combination with rye (Secale cereale) residues under zero tillage. CO2 emissions were larger in the zero till than in the conventional till treatments. A significant tillage/residue interaction was found. Highest emissions were measured from the conventionally tilled bean (Vicia faba) (1.0 kg N2O-N ha−1 emitted over 65 days) and zero tilled rye (3.5 kg N2O-N ha−1 over 65 days) treatments. This was attributed to rapid release of N following incorporation of bean residues in the conventionally tilled treatments, and availability of readily degradable C from the rye in the presence of anaerobic conditions under the mulch in the zero tilled treatments. Measurement of 15N-N2O emission following application of 15N-labelled fertiliser to microplots indicated that surface mulching of residues in zero till treatments resulted in a greater proportion of fertiliser N being lost as N2O than with incorporation of residues. Combined applications of 15N fertiliser and bean residues resulted in higher or lower emissions, depending on cultivation technique, when compared with the sum of N2O from single applications. Such interactions have important implications for mitigation of N2O from agricultural soils.

TI  - Silicate fertilization in no-tillage rice farming for mitigation of methane emission and increasing rice productivity.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Agricultural practices mostly influence methane (CH4) emissions from rice field, which must be controlled for maintaining the ecosystem balance. No-tillage farming with chemical amendments having electron acceptors could be an effective mitigation strategy in CH4 emissions from irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) field. An experiment was conducted in Korean paddy field under tillage and notillage farming practices with silicate iron slag amendments (1–4 Mg ha � 1 ) for suppressing CH4 emissions and maintaining rice productivity. It was found that CH4 emissions from the no-tillage rice field significantly decreased as compared to that of tilled field, irrespective of silicate amendments. The total seasonal CH4 flux from the control tillage and control no-tillage plots were recorded 38.1 and 27.9 g m � 2 , respectively, which were decreased by 20% and 36% with 4 Mg ha � 1 silicate amendment. Silicate fertilization (4 Mg ha � 1 ) with no-tillage system decreased total seasonal CH4 flux by 54% as compared to that of control tillage plot. This is most likely due to the higher concentrations of active iron and free iron oxides in the no-tilled rice field as compared to that of tilled field under silicate fertilization, which acted as electron acceptors and contributed to decrease CH4 emission. In addition, the improved soil porosity and redox potential, rice plant growth parameters such as active tillering rate, root volume and porosity, etc. in combination increased the rhizosphere oxygen concentrations and eventually suppressed CH4 emission during the rice growing season. The leaf photosynthetic rate was significantly increased with 4 Mg ha � 1 silicate amendment, which ultimately increased grain yield by 18% and 13% in the tilled and no-tilled rice field, respectively. CH4 flux showed a strong positive correlation with the availability of soil organic carbon, while there were negative correlations with soil porosity, soil pH, soil Eh, and the content of active iron and free iron oxides in soil.

TI  - Internal nutrient efficiencies of irrigated lowland rice in tropical and subtropical Asia
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract This study estimates the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) requirements of irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) in South- and Southeast Asia. Grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation in above-ground plant dry matter (DM) were measured at physiological maturity of rice ( n  ∼ 2000) in on-station and on-farm experiments in six Asian countries between 1995 and 1997. These data were used to model the nutrient requirements for yields up to 11 t ha −1 using the QUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) approach. The model required the estimation of two borderlines describing the minimum and maximum internal efficiencies (IE, kg grain per kg nutrient in plant DM), which were estimated at 42 and 96 kg grain kg −1 N, 206 and 622 kg grain kg −1 P and 36 and 115 kg grain kg −1 K, respectively. The model predicted a linear increase in grain yield if nutrients are taken up in balanced amounts of 14.7 kg N, 2.6 kg P and 14.5 kg K per 1000 kg of grain until yield targets reached ca. 70–80% of the climate-adjusted potential yield ( Y max ). The corresponding IEs were 68 kg grain kg −1 N, 385 kg grain kg −1 P and 69 kg grain kg −1 K for a balanced nutrition. The model predicted a decrease in IEs when yield targets approached Y max . The derived borderlines are valid for current modern, high-yielding indica cultivars with a harvest index of 0.50 kg kg −1 and can be used for all methods of crop establishment. Only Y max is required as site- or season-specific information when estimating nutrient requirements for a yield target making the model applicable for all irrigated lowlands in South- and Southeast Asia. Predicted IEs were greater than actual IEs measured in more than 200 farmers' fields ( n  ∼ 700), the latter averaging 59 kg grain kg −1 N (27–100 kg kg −1 ), 354 kg grain kg −1 P (158–1069 kg kg −1 ), and 64 kg grain kg −1 K (27–179 kg kg −1 ) with grain yields ranging from 1.5 to 9.9 t ha −1 (mean 5.2 t ha −1 ). Low and varying IEs in the farmers' practice were caused by nutritional imbalances, inadequate irrigation, or problems with pests and weeds.

TI  - A review of the effects of tillage systems on some soil physical properties, water content, nitrate availability and crops yield in the Argentine Pampas
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract The Argentine Pampas is one of the most important cropping regions of the World. Limited tillage systems, and specially no-till, had widespread in recent years, occupying actually around 70% of the surface devoted to annual crops. We review results produced in field experiments installed along the Pampas to determine the effect of the adoption of these tillage systems on some soil properties and crops yield. It was performed a metanalysis of data from experiments where plow tillage (mouldboard plow), reduced tillage (chisel plow, disk plow or harrow disk) and no-till were compared. Treatments effects were contrasted by paired t -tests between groups of paired data. Soil bulk density and cone penetration resistance of the 0–20 cm layer were higher under limited tillage systems than under plow tillage. Increases of bulk density under no-till in comparison to plow tillage were generally small, averaging 4%, but cone penetration increased by 50% in many soils. The increase of bulk density was greater in soils of initial low bulk density. Neither bulk density increases nor cone penetration changes reached critical threshold for roots development. Aggregate stability and water infiltration rate were higher in soils subjected to limited tillage systems than under plow tillage. The improvement of aggregate stability was higher in poorer structured soils, with an average increase of 70% under no-till in relation to plow tillage. Under no-till infiltration rate doubled in average that of plow tillage. Soil water content during the critical periods of sowing and flowering was generally greater under limited tillage but, conversely, nitrate nitrogen levels were greater in plow tillage. Higher soil water content under no-till in relation to plow tillage may satisfied the evapotranspiration demand of 1–3 days of crops during the critical flowering period, being nitrate nitrogen in average 21 kg ha −1 lower under no-till. Soybean ( Glicine max (L.)-Merr.) yield was not affected by tillage system, meanwhile wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and corn ( Zea mays L.) yields were lower under reduced tillage and no-till than under plow tillage without nitrogen fertilization. Wheat and corn no-till yields were 10–14% lower that yields under plow tillage as a mean. When fertilizers were applied, wheat and corn yield differences between tillage treatments generally disappeared. The adoption of limited tillage systems in the Pampas leads to soil improvement but also generates the necessity of increase nitrogen fertilizers utilization to sustain yields of graminaceus crops.

TI  - The influence of gas transport and porosity on methane oxidation in soils
PY  - 1997
AB  - Two porosity-dependent parameters that affect gas transport in soils, gas diffusivity and air permeability, were assessed as possible indicators of methane oxidation rates. Soil gas diffusivity was measured in intact cores in the laboratory and in situ, and air permeability was measured in intact cores. An in situ method of measuring gas diffusivity was specifically modified for this purpose to use Freon in a portable probe. A laboratory (core) method of measuring gas diffusivity, using krypton 85, was also employed. Measurements were made at the soil surface and at a range of depths within the topsoil, in conjunction with in situ measurements of CH4 oxidation, in forest, arable, and set-aside soils at a lowland site and in a forest soil at an upland site, in southeast Scotland. The surface layer of soil caused marked variations in diffusivity measurements, particularly with the in situ method. At the upland site, where a 50-mm-thick surface organic layer was present, the in situ technique revealed a sharp decrease in diffusivity with depth. Only where gas transport was low, in the set-aside soil, was methane oxidation rate influenced by gas transport changes associated with increasing soil water content. Differences in CH4 oxidation rates related better to core gas diffusivities than to in situ diffusivities. The relationship was best at 50–150 mm depth where diffusivities were lower than at the surface. Air permeability, which is affected more by soil structure than diffusivity, appeared to be as relevant as the latter parameter to CH4 oxidation rate, particularly for land use changes associated with agriculture. Thus CH4 oxidation rate appears to be influenced by gas transport properties and soil structure, either at the surface in the litter layer or below the surface where the oxidizing microorganisms are likely to occur.

TI  - Increased concentration of water-soluble carbohydrate in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) : milk production from late lactation dairy cows
PY  - 2001
AB  - Eight multiparous Holstein‐Friesian dairy cows in late lactation were used to investigate the potential of using perennial ryegrass with a high concentration of watersoluble carbohydrate (WSC) to increase the efficiency of milk production. After a pretreatment period on a common pasture, the cows were each given ad libitum access to one of two varieties of zero-grazed grass continuously for 3 weeks. Treatments were: high sugar (HS), an experimental perennial ryegrass variety bred to contain high concentrations of WSC; or control, a standard variety of perennial ryegrass (cv. AberElan) containing typical concentrations of WSC. The two grass varieties were matched in terms of heading date. All animals also received 4 kg day ‐1 standard dairy concentrate. Grass dry matter (DM) intake was not significantly different between treatments (11AE6 vs. 10AE7 kg DM day ‐1 ; s.e.d. 0AE95 for HS and control diets respectively), although DM digestibility was higher on the HS diet (0AE71 vs. 0AE64 g g ‐1 DM; s.e.d. 0AE23; P <0 AE01) leading to higher digestible DM intakes for that diet. Milk yield from animals offered the HS diet was higher (15AE3 vs. 12AE6 kg day ‐1 ; s.e.d. 0AE87; P <0 AE05) and, although milk constituent concentrations were unaffected by treatment, milk protein yields were significantly increased on the HS diet. The partitioning of feed N was significantly affected by diet, with more N from the HS diet being used for milk production (0AE30 vs. 0AE23 g milk N g ‐1 feed N; s.e.d. 0AE012; P <0 AE01) and less being excreted in urine (0AE25 vs. 0AE35; s.e.d. 0AE020; P <0 AE01). In a separate experiment, using the same grasses harvested earlier in the season, the fractional rate of DM degradation, measured by in situ and gas production techniques, was higher for the HS grass than for the control. It is concluded that increased digestible DM intakes of the HS grass led to increased milk yields, whereas increased efficiency of utilization of the HS grass in the rumen resulted in the more efficient use of feed N for milk production and reduced N excretion.

TI  - Measurement of Net Global Warming Potential in Three Agroecosystems
PY  - 2005
AB  - When appraising the impact of food and fiber production systems on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the ‘greenhouse’ effect, the entire suite of biogenic greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) – needs to be considered. Storage of atmospheric CO2 into stable organic carbon pools in the soil can sequester CO2 while common crop production practices can produce CO2, generate N2O, and decrease the soil sink for atmospheric CH4. The overall balance between the net exchange of these gases constitutes the net global warming potential (GWP) of a crop production system. Trace gas flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage data from long-term studies, a rainfed site in Michigan that contrasts conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping, a rainfed site in northeastern Colorado that compares cropping systems in NT, and an irrigated site in Colorado that compares tillage and crop rotations, are used to estimate net GWP from crop production systems. Nitrous oxide emissions comprised 40–44% of the GWP from both rain-fed sites and contributed 16–33% of GWP in the irrigated system. The energy used for irrigation was the dominant GWP source in the irrigated system. Whether a system is a sink or source of CO2, i.e. net GWP, was controlled by the rate of SOC storage in all sites. SOC accumulation in the surface 7.5 cm of both rainfed continuous cropping systems was approximately 1100 kg CO2 equivalents ha−1 y−1. Carbon accrual rates were about three times higher in the irrigated system. The rainfed systems had been in NT for >10 years while the irrigated system had been converted to NT 3 years before the start of this study. It remains to be seen if the C accrual rates decline with time in the irrigated system or if N2O emission rates decline or increase with time after conversion to NT.

TI  - Methane emissions from double-rice cropping system under conventional and no tillage in southeast China
PY  - 2011
AB  - A field experiment was carried out to investigate the methane emission pattern in a double-rice cropping system under conventional and no tillage in southeast China. The treatments included conventional tillage cultivation in both early rice and late rice (T–T) and conventional tillage in early rice but no-till in late rice (T–NT). The maximum methane emission rate of T–T and T–NT was 21.71 mg m−2 h−1 and 24.70 mg m−2 h−1 in early rice, respectively; and 18.52 mg m−2 h−1 and 7.32 mg m−2 h−1 in late rice, respectively. The seasonal amount of methane emission from the T–T and T–NT was not significantly different in early rice, but significant different (P < 0.05) in late rice, with the values 6.57 g m−2 and 3.04 g m−2, respectively. In comparison with early rice, the seasonal amount methane flux of late rice was reduced by 29% and 68% in the T–T and T–NT, respectively. The decrease of methane emission in the T–NT was attributed to lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and higher soil bulk density. In conclusion, no tillage practice conducted in rice cropping season will markedly decrease methane emission for the rice cropping system.

TI  - Protein degradation and fermentation characteristics of unwilted red clover and alfalfa silage harvested at various times during the day
PY  - 2002
AB  - Extensive proteolysis during fermentation of highprotein legumes reduces dietary N-use efficiency in ruminants. Research has demonstrated that enhancing the level of fermentable carbohydrates in crops entering the silo may reduce protein degradation by increasing the rate of decline in pH. The objective was to evaluate whether delaying cutting time during the day, to allow accumulation of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), would inhibit proteolysis in the silo. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were harvested at 06.00, 10.00, 14.00 and 18.00 hours in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and ensiled without wilting. TNC accumulated in fresh forage during the day, with starch accounting for more than 0AE50 of the daily change in TNC in fresh herbage of both species, except in red clover in 1995. The level of TNC in fresh forage did not consistently affect the extent of protein degradation in either species and, in all instances, alfalfa underwent more extensive proteolysis than red clover. Silage pH typically decreased and starch concentration increased as cutting time was delayed from 06.00 to 18.00 hours. Although the extent of proteolysis was largely unaffected by inherent increases in TNC, harvesting in the afternoon did provide several benefits including increased dry-matter content, lower silage pH and higher starch concentrations. Effluent production is a concern in any unwilted silage system; there was therefore an added advantage of lower moisture content from cutting in the afternoon.

TI  - Evidence for biological nitrification inhibition in Brachiaria pastures
PY  - 2009
AB  - Nitrification, a key process in the global nitrogen cycle that generates nitrate through microbial activity, may enhance losses of fertilizer nitrogen by leaching and denitrification. Certain plants can suppress soil-nitrification by releasing inhibitors from roots, a phenomenon termed biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). Here, we report the discovery of an effective nitrification inhibitor in the root-exudates of the tropical forage grass Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Schweick. Named “brachialactone,” this inhibitor is a recently discovered cyclic diterpene with a unique 5-8-5-membered ring system and a γ-lactone ring. It contributed 60–90% of the inhibitory activity released from the roots of this tropical grass. Unlike nitrapyrin (a synthetic nitrification inhibitor), which affects only the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) pathway, brachialactone appears to block both AMO and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzymatic pathways in Nitrosomonas. Release of this inhibitor is a regulated plant function, triggered and sustained by the availability of ammonium (NH4+) in the root environment. Brachialactone release is restricted to those roots that are directly exposed to NH4+. Within 3 years of establishment, Brachiaria pastures have suppressed soil nitrifier populations (determined as amoA genes; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea), along with nitrification and nitrous oxide emissions. These findings provide direct evidence for the existence and active regulation of a nitrification inhibitor (or inhibitors) release from tropical pasture root systems. Exploiting the BNI function could become a powerful strategy toward the development of low-nitrifying agronomic systems, benefiting both agriculture and the environment.

TI  - Carbon dioxide flux as affected by tillage and irrigation in soil converted from perennial forages to annual crops
PY  - 2007
AB  - Among greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most significant contributors to regional and global warming as well as climatic change. A field study was conducted to (i) determine the effect of soil characteristics resulting from changes in soil management practices on CO2 flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere in transitional land from perennial forages to annual crops, and (ii) develop empirical relationships that predict CO2 flux from soil temperature and soil water content. The CO2 flux, soil temperature (Ts), volumetric soil water content (θv) were measured every 1–2 weeks in no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) malt barley and undisturbed soil grass-alfalfa (UGA) systems in a Lihen sandy loam soil (sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustoll) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in western North Dakota. Soil air-filled porosity (e) was calculated from total soil porosity and θv measurements. Significant differences in CO2 fluxes between land management practices (irrigation and tillage) were observed on some measurement dates. Higher CO2 fluxes were detected in CT plots than in NT and UGA treatments immediately after rainfall or irrigation. Soil CO2 fluxes increased with increasing soil moisture (R2=0.15, P<0.01) while an exponential relationship was found between CO2 emission and Ts (R2=0.59). Using a stepwise regression analysis procedure, a significant multiple regression equation was developed between CO2 flux and θv, Ts (CO2flux=e-3.477+0.123Ts+6.381θvflux=e-3.477+0.123Ts+6.381θv; R2=0.68, P⩽0.01). Not surprisingly, soil temperature was a driving factor in the equation, which accounted for approximately 59% in variation of CO2 flux. It was concluded that less intensive tillage, such as no-till or strip tillage, along with careful irrigation management will reduce soil CO2 evolution from land being converted from perennial forages to annual crops.

TI  - The impact of breeding to reduce residual feed intake on enteric methane emissions from the Australian beef industry
PY  - 2006
AB  - The expected reduction in methane emissions from the Australian beef herd resulting from using bulls identified as being more feed efficient as a result of having a lower residual feed intake (RFI) was modelled, both in a single herd in southern Australia and in the national herd. A gene flow model was developed to simulate the spread of improved RFI genes through a breeding herd over 25 years, from 2002 to 2026. Based on the estimated gene flow, the voluntary feed intakes were revised annually for all beef classes using livestock populations taken from the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI). Changes in emissions (kg methane/animal.year) associated with the reduction in feed intake were then calculated using NGGI procedures. Annual enteric methane emissions from both the individual and national herd were calculated by multiplying the livestock numbers in each beef class by the revised estimates of emissions per animal. For an individual adopting herd, the annual methane abatement in year 25 of selection was 15.9% lower than in year 1. For the national herd, differential lags and limits to adoption were assumed for northern and southern Australia. The cumulative reduction in national emissions was 568 100 t of methane over 25 years, with annual emissions in year 25 being 3.1% lower than in year 1. It is concluded that selection for reduced RFI will lead to substantial and lasting methane abatement, largely as a consequence of its implementation as a breeding objective for the grazing beef herd.

TI  - Livestock methane emission: From the individual grazing animal through national inventories to the global methane cycle
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Methane is a potent greenhouse gas whose atmospheric abundance has grown 2.5-fold over three centuries, due in large part to agricultural expansion. The farming of ruminant livestock, which generate and emit methane during digestion (‘enteric fermentation’), is a leading contributor to this growth. This paper overviews the measurement or estimation of enteric methane emissions at a range of spatial scales. Measurement of individual animal emissions focuses particularly on grazing livestock for which the SF6 tracer technique is uniquely appropriate. Gaining insight into factors that influence methane production requires that feed intake and feed properties be determined, enabling the methane emitted to be expressed per unit of intake. The latter expression is commonly encapsulated in the ‘methane conversion factor’, Ym, an entity that enables small-scale methane emission estimates to be extrapolated to national and global enteric methane inventories. The principles of this extrapolation and sources of uncertainty are discussed, along with the significance of this global source within the global methane cycle. Micrometeorological and similar measurement techniques over intermediate spatial scales are also surveyed.

TI  - Short-term temporal changes of soil carbon losses after tillage described by a first-order decay model
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Tillage stimulates soil carbon (C) losses by increasing aeration, changing temperature and moisture conditions, and thus favoring microbial decomposition. In addition, soil aggregate disruption by tillage exposes once protected organic matter to decomposition. We propose a model to explain carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission after tillage as a function of the no-till emission plus a correction due to the tillage disturbance. The model assumes that C in the readily decomposable organic matter follows a first-order reaction kinetics equation as: d C sail ( t )/d t  = − kC soil ( t ) and that soil C-CO 2 emission is proportional to the C decay rate in soil, where C soil ( t ) is the available labile soil C (g m −2 ) at any time ( t ). Emissions are modeled in terms soil C available to decomposition in the tilled and non-tilled plots, and a relationship is derived between no-till ( F NT ) and tilled ( F T ) fluxes, which is: F T = a 1 F NT e − a 2 t , where t is time after tillage. Predicted and observed fluxes showed good agreement based on determination coefficient ( R 2 ), index of agreement and model efficiency, with R 2 as high as 0.97. The two parameters included in the model are related to the difference between the decay constant ( k factor) of tilled and no-till plots ( a 2 ) and also to the amount of labile carbon added to the readily decomposable soil organic matter due to tillage ( a 1 ). These two parameters were estimated in the model ranging from 1.27 and 2.60 ( a 1 ) and −1.52 × 10 −2 and 2.2 × 10 −2  day −1 ( a 2 ). The advantage is that temporal variability of tillage-induced emissions can be described by only one analytical function that includes the no-till emission plus an exponential term modulated by tillage and environmentally dependent parameters.

TI  - Improvement in soil structure associated with white clover
PY  - 1993
AB  - Observations have been made which suggest that clover is more effective than ryegrass in developing rapid improvements in soil structure. To test this hypothesis, grass, grass/clover and clover swards were grown in undisturbed field cores. Significant differences in drainage rates and plant biomass production, and visible changes in soil structure, all supported the hypothesis that clover improves structure rapidly, but there were no significant differences in bulk density, porosity or aggregate stability between the treatments. Soil moisture characteristic curves of soil/peat/grit compost planted with grass, grass/clover or clover and grown for two years indicate that a more free-draining structure develops under clover than under grass due to a higher ratio of macro- to micropores.

TI  - Influence of freshwater marsh tillage on microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen
PY  - 2008
AB  - The changes in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were examined in order to assess the effect of surface layer soil (0 - 10 cm) under different land-use types after freshwater marshes tillage in the Sanjiang Plain Northeast China. Land uses were Deyeuxia angustifolia freshwater marshes ((DAM), cultivated land (CL), recovery freshwater marsh (RFM), constructed woodland (CW). After DAM soil tillage, MBC, MBN, DOC and DON declined strongly in agricultural surface soil layer, decreased 63.8%-80.5% (MBC), 56.3%-67.1% (MBN), 43.1%-44.3% (DOC) and 25.2%-56.1% (DON) respectively. In contrast, these C, N fraction had significant recovered in RFM and CW surface soil, increased 36.1%-59.9% (MBC), 46.7%-65.9% (MBN), 67.0%-69.3% (DOC)and 81.2%-88.3% (DON) respectively. Cultivation and land-use affected soil MBC, MBN, DOC and DON intensely. Therefore these labile C, N fractions have the significant relative under different land-use types. However DOC was more obvious controlled than DON by the land-use types. The relative between DOC and MBC, MBN have much difference than DON, the main reason of this distinction is the diverse source in available carbon and nitrogen that taken by microbial property under different land uses.

TI  - Tillage-induced environmental conditions in soil and substrate limitation determine biogenic gas production
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Tillage changes soil environmental conditions and controls the distribution of residues in the soil, both actions that affect the production and emission of soil biogenic gases (CO2, N2O, and CH4). The objective of this study was to determine how tillage-induced environmental conditions and substrate quality affect the mineralization rate of easily metabolizable compounds and the subsequent production of these gases. Carbon compounds, with and without nitrogen, were applied to soil cropped to maize under tilled and no-till systems. Following substrate application in the spring and summer, biogenic gases were measured periodically at the soil surface (flux) and within the profile (concentration) at 10-, 20-, and 30-cm depths (i.e., within, at the bottom of, and below the plough layer). Strong CO2 and N2O responses to sucrose and glycine in both the field and the laboratory indicate that the soil was C- and N-limited. Surface fluxes of CO2 and N2O were greater in soils amended with glycine than with sucrose and were greater in tilled than no-till soils. Transient emission of CH4 following the addition of glycine was observed and could be attributed to inhibition of N mineralization and nitrification processes on CH4 oxidation. Laboratory and field measurements indicated that the larger substrate-induced CO2 emission from the tilled soils could not be attributed to differences in the total biomass or the basal respiratory activity of the soils. Thus, there appears to be no underlying difference in the functional capacity of the microbial communities under different tillage regimes. Comparison of gas profiles indicates relative accumulation of CO2 at depth in soils under no-till, as well as greater decline in profile CO2 content with time in the tilled compared to the no-till soil. These results support the conclusion that greater CO2 efflux from the tilled soils resulted from more rapid gas diffusion through the profile. Hence, the observed differences in gas fluxes between tilled and no-till soils can be attributed to differences in physical environment.

TI  - Soil and water protection using conservation tillage in Northern and Central Europe
PY  - 2004
AB  - SOWAP is an acronym for a project called Soil And Water Protection Using Conservation Tillage In Northern And Central Europe aiming to assess the viability of a more “conservation-oriented” agriculture in the UK, Belgium and Hungary. SOWAP works at the farm scale, with detailed monitoring taking place at the plot level. The conservation tillage systems tested by the project will be applied at field sites in the three countries. Local variations and farmer/land owner preference will be considered and documented, making use of the WOCAT methodology. The consultation and participation by all stakeholders is critical to the success of SOWAP. Economic aspects as well as environmental benefits will be assessed for the conventional practice, for a conservation tillage practice devised by SOWAP in co-operation with the farmer and for a SOWAP “appropriate practice” crop solution. The impact of the three cultivation practices will be compared on run-off plots by measuring sediment and water run-off, loss of soil nutrients/fertilizers, and pesticide losses. Secondly, separate areas of the monitoring sites will be used to assess the impacts of the practices on soil ecology and soil physical-chemical properties, with particular emphasis on reduction of off-site pollution, enhancement of soil structure and carbon sequestration and increase of biodiversity, due to conservation practices Further assessments will be made of the impacts on larger species e.g. birds and fish.

TI  - Soil Carbon Saturation Controls Labile and Stable Carbon Pool Dynamics
PY  - 2008
AB  - Recently, it has been suggested that soil organic C (SOC) does not always respond linearly to increasing C input, thereby limiting the rate and efficiency of C stabilization in soils. Therefore, we postulated that when a soil is exposed to a broad range of C inputs through a range of manure treatments, it will show C saturation behavior and different SOC pools will saturate at different rates. To test this, different SOC pools were isolated by physical fractionation techniques from a long-term agricultural experiment in Lethbridge, Canada. In this experiment, manure has been applied since 1973 at rates of 0, 60, 120, and 180 Mg ha -1 yr -1 (wet weight). In the total mineral soil as well as the small macroaggregates (250-2000 μm), microaggregates (53-250 μm), and the silt plus clay fraction ( 2000 μm) were the only water-stable aggregate fraction that increased in C content across all manure input levels. Further physical separation of macroaggregates into subpools by microaggregate isolation showed that coarse (>250 μm) particulate organic matter (POM) was the fraction that accounted most for the increase in C content of the large macroaggregates. Furthermore, the turnover of large macroaggregates increased with increasing manure applications, as indicated by decreased formation and stabilization of intramicroaggregate POM within the large macroaggregates. We conclude that as C input increases, the mineral fraction of a soil saturates and consequently additional C input will only accumulate in labile soil C pools that have a relatively faster turnover.

TI  - Can less yield more? Is reducing nutrient input into the environment compatible with maintaining crop production?
PY  - 2004
AB  - Plant scientists have long recognized the need to develop crops that absorb and use nutrients more efficiently. Two approaches have been used to increase nutrient use efficiency (NUE) in crop plants. The first involves both traditional breeding and marker-assisted selection in an attempt to identify the genes involved. The second uses novel gene constructs designed to improve specific aspects of NUE. Here, we discuss some recent developments in the genetic manipulation of NUE in crop plants and argue that an improved understanding of the transition between nitrogen assimilation and nitrogen recycling will be important in applying this technology to increasing crop yields. Moreover, we emphasize the need to combine genetic and transgenic approaches to make significant improvements in NUE.

TI  - Measurement and simulation of void structure and hydraulic changes caused by root-induced soil structuring under white clover compared to ryegrass
PY  - 2007
AB  - Re-packed soil columns of the Crediton series were sown with white clover or perennial ryegrass, with nitrate managed according to organic and conventional farming regimes respectively. Visual observations revealed a rapid enhancement in soil structure beneath white clover compared to ryegrass and unplanted soil. Enhanced structural differentiation beneath white clover was supported by greater permeability to air and freer drainage to water. Differences in soil structure were verified by water retention measurements over a range of tensions between the wilting and gravity drainage points. The void structure was simulated with the Pore-Cor network model, which verified larger pores beneath clover, a difference in local structuring and a saturated hydraulic conductivity which was four times greater than ryegrass. The study highlighted inadequacies in current approaches to the measurement and interpretation of water retention.

TI  - Temperate grasslands and global atmospheric change: a review
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary
Recent reviews confirm and extend previous observations that elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations stimulate photosynthesis, leading to increased plant productivity. Elevated CO2 concentrations tend to reduce the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to low levels of precipitation but induce progressive nitrogen (N) limitations on plant growth which can be alleviated by supplying a significant external input of N in the form of mineral fertilizer or through the increased use of N-fixing legumes. Other nutrients, such as phosphorus, can act as the main limiting factor restricting the growth response in legumes to atmospheric CO2 concentration. The botanical composition of temperate grasslands is affected by the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, possibly through a decline in the relative abundance of grasses. Elevated CO2 concentration will also alter the feeding value of herbage to grazers both in terms of fine-scale (for example, crude protein concentration and C:N ratio) and coarse-scale (legumes vs. grasses and C3- vs. C4-species) changes. The management guidelines of grasslands will need to be adapted to global atmospheric and climatic changes and to increased variability in climate.

TI  - Long-term impact of reduced tillage and residue management on soil carbon stabilization: Implications for conservation agriculture on contrasting soils
PY  - 2007
AB  - Residue retention and reduced tillage are both conservation agricultural management options that may enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization in tropical soils. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of long-term tillage and residue management on SOC dynamics in a Chromic Luvisol (red clay soil) and Areni-Gleyic Luvisol (sandy soil) in Zimbabwe. At the time of sampling the soils had been under conventional tillage (CT), mulch ripping (MR), clean ripping (CR) and tied ridging (TR) for 9 years. Soil was fully dispersed and separated into 212–2000 mm (coarse sand), 53–212 mm (fine sand), 20–53 mm (coarse silt), 5–20 mm (fine silt) and 0–5 mm (clay) size fractions. The whole soil and size fractions were analyzed for C content. Conventional tillage treatments had the least amount of SOC, with 14.9 mg C g � 1 soil and 4.2 mg C g � 1 soil for the red clay and sandy soils, respectively. The highest SOC content was 6.8 mg C g � 1 soil in the sandy soil under MR, whereas for the red clay soil, TR had the highest SOC content of 20.4 mg C g � 1 soil. Organic C in the size fractions increased with decreasing size of the fractions. In both soils, the smallest response to management was observed in the clay size fractions, confirming that this size fraction is the most stable. The coarse sand-size fraction was most responsive to management in the sandy soil where MR had 42% more organic C than CR, suggesting that SOC contents of this fraction are predominantly controlled by amounts of C input. In contrast, the fine sand fraction was the most responsive fraction in the red clay soil with a 66% greater C content in the TR than CT. This result suggests that tillage disturbance is the dominant factor reducing C stabilization in a clayey soil, probably by reducing C stabilization within microaggregates. In conclusion, developing viable conservation agriculture practices to optimize SOC contents and long-term agroecosystem sustainability should prioritize the maintenance of C inputs (e.g. residue retention) to coarse textured soils, but should focus on the reduction of SOC decomposition (e.g. through reduced tillage) in fine textured soils. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of climate and management intensity on nitrous oxide emissions in grassland systems across Europe
PY  - 2007
AB  - Soil/atmosphere exchange fluxes of nitrous oxide were monitored for a 3-year period at 10 grassland sites in eight European countries (Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom), spanning a wide range of climatic, environmental and soil conditions. Most study sites investigated the influence of one or several management practices on N2O exchange, such as nitrogen fertilization and grazing intensity. Fluxes were measured using non-steady state chambers at most sites, and alternative measurement techniques such as eddy covariance and fast-box using tunable diode laser spectroscopy were implemented at some sites. The overall uncertainty in annual flux estimates derived from chamber measurements may be as high as 50% due to the temporal and spatial variability in fluxes, which warrants the future use of continuous measurements, if possible at the field scale. Annual emission rates were higher from intensive than from extensive grasslands, by a factor 4 if grazed (1.77 versus 0.48 kg N2O-N ha?1 year?1) and by a factor 3 if ungrazed (0.95 versus 0.32 kg N2O-N ha?1 year?1). Annual emission factors for fertilized systems were highly variable, ranging from 0.01% to 3.56%, but the mean emission factor across all sites (0.75%) was substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1.25%. Emission factors for individual fertilization events increased with soil temperature and were generally higher for water-filled pore space values in the range 60?90%, though precipitation onto dry soils was also shown to lead to high losses of N2O-N from applied fertilizer. An empirical, multiple regression model to predict N2O emission factors on the basis of soil temperature, moisture and rainfall is developed, explaining half of the variability in observed emission factors.Peer reviewe

TI  - Emissions of N2O and NO from fertilized fields: Summary of available measurement data
PY  - 2002
AB  - [1] Information from 846 N2O emission measurements in agricultural fields and 99 measurements for NO emissions was summarized to assess the influence of various factors regulating emissions from mineral soils. The data indicate that there is a strong increase of both N2O and NO emissions accompanying N application rates, and soils with high organic-C content show higher emissions than less fertile soils. A fine soil texture, restricted drainage, and neutral to slightly acidic conditions favor N2O emission, while (though not significant) a good soil drainage, coarse texture, and neutral soil reaction favor NO emission. Fertilizer type and crop type are important factors for N2O but not for NO, while the fertilizer application mode has a significant influence on NO only. Regarding the measurements, longer measurement periods yield more of the fertilization effect on N2O and NO emissions, and intensive measurements (≥1 per day) yield lower emissions than less intensive measurements (2–3 per week). The available data can be used to develop simple models based on the major regulating factors which describe the spatial variability of emissions of N2O and NO with less uncertainty than emission factor approaches based on country N inputs, as currently used in national emission inventories.

TI  - The role of land carbon sinks in mitigating global climate change
PY  - 2001
AB  - As evidence for the link between atmospheric greenhouse gases and climate change has increased, international efforts have focused on ways in which anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, can be reduced. However attempts to commit countries to reduce their emissions though the ratification of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol have been hampered by disagreement about the extent to which land carbon sinks should be considered in meeting these reduction commitments. The report highlights the considerable uncertainty in the scientific understanding of the causes, magnitude and permanence of the land carbon sink. While noting that the potential for human enhancement of the land carbon sink through changes in land management practices is finite in size and duration, it recommends that methods used in the production of forest and agricultural crops should be modified to reflect their short-term role in absorbing carbon dioxide. Reform of the European Unions Common Agricultural Policy could provide one opportunity to achieve this on agricultural land in Europe. With respect to the inclusion of land carbon sinks in the Kyoto Protocol, the report expresses concern that measurement techniques currently available are not sufficiently accurate to permit the reliable monitoring of any land carbon sinks that may be designated as part of such international agreements. The report concludes that projects designed to enhance land carbon sinks should not be allowed to divert financial and political resources away from long-term solutions to the problem of reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, namely the reduction in the use of fossil fuels.

TI  - Emissions of nitrous oxide from Irish arable soils: effects of tillage and reduced N input
PY  - 2009
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux measurements from an Irish spring barley field managed under conventional and reduced tillage and different N fertilizer applications at the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre were made for two consecutive seasons. The aim was to investigate the efficacy of reduced tillage and reduced N fertilizer on seasonal fluxes and emission factors of N2O and to study the relationship between crop yield and N-induced fluxes of N2O. The soil is classified as a sandy loam with a pH of 7.4 and a mean organic carbon and nitrogen content at 15 cm of 19 and 1.9 g kg−1 dry soil, respectively. Reduced tillage had no significant effect on N2O fluxes from soils or crop grain yield. Multiple regression analysis revealed that soil moisture and an interaction between soil moisture and soil nitrate are the main significant factors affecting N2O flux. The derived emission factor was 0.6% of the applied N fertilizer, approximately 50% of the IPCC default EF of 1.25% used by the Irish EPA to estimate GHG or the IPCC revised EF of 0.9%. This resulted in huge overestimations of 2,275 and 1,050 tonnes of N2O-N for using the old and revised IPCC default factors respectively. By reducing the applied nitrogen fertilizer by 50% compared to the normal field rate, N2O emissions could be reduced by 57% with no significant decrease on grain yield or quality. This was consistent over the 2 years of measurements.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions and controls as influenced by tillage and crop residue management strategy
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Mixed responses of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes to reduced tillage/no-till are widely reported across soil types and regions. In a field experiment on a Danish sandy loam soil we compared N2O emissions during winter barley growth following five years of direct drilling (DD), reduced tillage (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Each of these tillage treatments further varied in respect to whether the resulting plot crop residues were retained (+Res) or removed (−Res). Sampling took place from autumn 2007 to the end of spring 2008. Overall N2O emissions were 27 and 26% lower in DD and RT, respectively, relative to N2O emissions from CT plots (P

TI  - Long-term trends in nitrous oxide emissions, soil nitrogen, and crop yields of till and no-till cropping systems.
PY  - 2006
AB  - No-till cropping can increase soil C stocks and aggregation but patterns of long-term changes in N 2 O emissions, soil N availability, and crop yields still need to be resolved. We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N 2 O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotations between 1989 and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO 3 - concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO 3 - concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m -2 yr -1 over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 ± 0.52 g N ha d -1 ) and no-till (3.63 ± 0.53 g N ha d -1 ) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO 2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N 2 O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs.

TI  - Emissions of Nitrous Oxide and Carbon Dioxide
PY  - 2006
AB  - Innovative management practices are required to increase the efficiency of N fertilizer usage and to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from agricultural soils. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using conservation tillage and N fertilizer placement depth to reduce N 2 O and CO 2 emissions associated with corn (Zea mays L.) production on clay loam soils in Eastern Canada. A 3-yr field study was established on a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation with each phase of the rotation present every year. Investigations were focused on the corn phase of the rotation. The tillage treatments following winter wheat included fall moldboard plow tillage (15 cm depth), fall zone-tillage (21 cm width, 15 cm depth), and no-tillage. The N placement treatments were \"shallow\" placement of sidedress N (2-cm depth) and \"deep\" placement of sidedress N (10-cm depth). Nitrous oxide emissions were measured 53 times and CO 2 emissions were measured 43 times over three growing seasons using field-based sampling chambers. There was a significant tillage and N placement interaction on N 2 O emissions. Averaged over all three tillage systems and site-years, N 2 O emissions from shallow N placement (2.83 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) were 26% lower than deep N placement (3.83 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ). The N 2 O emissions were similar among the tillage treatments when N was placed in the soil at a shallow depth. However, when N was placed deeper in the soil (10 cm), the 3-yr average N 2 O emissions from zone-tillage (2.98 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) were 20% lower than from no-tillage (3.71 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) and 38% lower than those from moldboard plow tillage (4.81 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ). Tillage type and N placement depth did not affect CO 2 emissions (overall average = 5.80 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ). Hence, zone-tillage and shallow N placement depth reduced N 2 O emissions without affecting CO 2 emissions.

TI  - Quantification of the effects of contrasting crops in the development of soil structure: an organic conversion
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil structure can be greatly affected, and hence manipulated, by agricultural management practices, such as crop rotation. This study aims to illustrate how soil structure under a stockless organic system differed between contrasting crop types using quantified data derived from image analysis. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from five organic conversion strategies in the second year of conversion, during two contrasting seasons in 2001 and following one uniform crop (oats) grown on all the plots in 2004. The samples were impregnated and images of soil structure collected at selected depth intervals. The images were analysed for macroporosity, pore size distribution and pore-perimeter fractal dimension. Significant differences were found between treatments in terms of overall macroporosity (%) and average pore size (mm 2 ) in 2001. The red clover (Trifolium pratense) treatments had the highest soil macroporosity in 2001, but showed a dramatic drop in 2004 accompanied by a reduction in average pore size (mm 2 ). Pore-perimeter fractal dimensions for four of the five crop treatments in 2001 did not show significant differences. However, there was a significant decrease in the fractal dimensions in 2004, indicating the presence of pores with less rough and irregular pore boundaries following a uniform cereal crop. Benefits to soil structure and porosity from clover were large and significant but were not lasting.

TI  - Tillage effects on cassava (Manihot esculenta) production and some soil properties
PY  - 1990
AB  - Abstract Cassava is traditionally grown on tilled soils. Interest in reduced-tillage systems is increasing in the humid tropics due to erosion problems. A field study was conducted on a sandy clay loam Ultisol to compare cassava performance in three tillage systems effects on soil water and organic carbon content. Tillage treatments were: (1) ploughing, harrowing and ridging (conventional); (2) digger-made holes (minimum); (3) pushing the sharpened end of cassavs cuttigs directly into the soil (no-till). Tillage did not affect total biomass yields in the first year. In the second year, significant differences were obtained in the yield of tops but not of fresh roots. No-till and minimum tillage out-yielded the conventional system by 40% and 23%, respectively, in the yield of tops,. It was apparent that elimination of ploughing did not reduce total biomass yield. Soil moisture contents in no-till and minimum tillage were significantly higher ( P = 0.05) than in the conventional-tillage system. Conv organic carbon decresed significantly ( P = 0.01) over time in all tillage systems. Conventional tillage gave the highest reduction. Cassava may be grown successfully in reduced-tillage systems in Ultisols of the humid tropics.

TI  - Agricultural management impacts on soil organic carbon storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions
PY  - 2005
AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of changing agricultural land use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions. We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist>tropical dry>temperate moist>temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58 ± 0.12, or 58% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69 ± 0.13, temperate moist with 0.71 ± 0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82 ± 0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23 ± 0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17 ± 0.05, temperate moist was 1.16 ± 0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10 ± 0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.

TI  - Preliminary estimates of the potential for carbon mitigation in European soils through no‐till farming
PY  - 1998
AB  - In this paper we estimate the European potential for carbon mitigation of no-till farming using results from European tillage experiments. Our calculations suggest some potential in terms of (a) reduced agricultural fossil fuel emissions, and (b) increased soil carbon sequestration. We estimate that 100% conversion to no-till farming would be likely to sequester about 23 Tg C y(-1) in the European Union or about 43 Tg C y(-1) in the wider Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union). In addition, up to 3.2 Tg C y(-1) could be saved in agricultural fossil fuel emissions. Compared to estimates of the potential for carbon sequestration of other carbon mitigation options, no-till agriculture shows nearly twice the potential of scenarios whereby soils are amended with organic materials. Our calculations suggest that 100% conversion to no-till agriculture in Europe could mitigate all fossil fuel-carbon emissions from agriculture in Europe. However, this is equivalent to only about 4.1% of total anthropogenic CO2-carbon produced annually in Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union) which in turn is equivalent to about 0.8% of global annual anthropogenic CO2-carbon emissions.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes following tillage and wetting in a wheat-fallow cropping system
PY  - 1998
AB  - Little is known about the relative contributions of episodic tillage and precipitation events to annual greenhouse gas emissions from soil. Consequently, the authors measured carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}), nitrous oxide (N{sub 2}O), and methane (CH{sub 4}) fluxes from soil in a wheat-fallow cropping system in western Nebraska using vented surface chambers, before and immediately after tillage and wetting with 5.1 cm of water, during the fallow period in 1995/1996. Replicated fallow management treatments included no-tillage, subtillage, and plow representing a wide range in degree of soil disturbance. Soil bulk density, water-filled pore space, electrical conductivity (EC{sub 1:1}), nitrate (NO{sub 3}), and pH within the top 30.5 cm soil, and soil temperature at 0 to 7.6 cm were measured to assess their correlation with variations in gas flux and tillage and wetting. Atmospheric concentrations above the soil (at {approximately} 40 cm) increased by 15% for CO{sub 2} and 9 to 31% for N{sub 2}O and 6 to 16% for CH{sub 4} within 1 min after tillage and returned to background concentrations within 2 h. Except immediately after tillage, net CH{sub 4} flux was negative, from the atmosphere into soil, and is referred to as CH{sub 4} uptake. Overall, increases (1.5--4-fold) inmore » CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O losses from soil, and CH{sub 4} uptake by soil were short lived and returned to background levels within 8 to 24 h after tillage. Losses of CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O increased to 1.7 and 5 times background emissions, respectively, for 24 h following wetting, while CH{sub 4} uptake declined by about 60% for 3 to 14 d after wetting. Water-filled pore space in the surface soil fell below 60% within 24 h after saturation and exhibited an inverse relationship (R{sup 2} = 0.66) with CH{sub 4} uptake. A significant decline in soil NO{sub 3} and EC{sub 1:1} in the top 7.6 cm occurred following wetting. Under the experimental conditions, and the expected frequency of tillage and wetting events, failure to include these short-lived episodic gas pulses in annual flux estimations may underestimate annual CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O loss up to 13 and 24%, respectively, and overestimate CH{sub 4} uptake by up to 18% in this cropping system.« less

TI  - Dissolved and water-extractable organic matter in soils: a review on the influence of land use and management practices
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Despite that dissolved organic matter (DOM) and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) represent only a small part of soil organic matter, they appear to be involved in many soil processes. This review intends to compile the current information on the influence of land use and management practices on soil DOM and WEOM, and to identify the gaps in our knowledge that sometimes preclude from drawing general conclusions. The literature on DOM and WEOM dynamics in different ecosystems is derived mainly from studies on temperate forest soils. Although less abundant, literature on temperate grassland and arable soils is also available, whereas very few studies have been published on tropical ecosystems. Similarly, studies on DOM and WEOM have focused mainly on the carbon fraction, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus have received much less attention. On the short term, temporal and spatial variations in DOM and WEOM are complex and influenced by environmental conditions. Laboratory studies have shown that management practices, such as liming and N fertilization, can induce marked fluctuations in DOM and WEOM. Under field conditions, however, the net effect of management practices often remains unclear because many soil properties, which can interact and counterbalance, are influenced at the same time. Changes in DOM and WEOM upon management practices are generally of short duration, whereas long-term effects are more related to vegetation type and to the amount of plant litter returned to the soil. So far, research on soil DOM and WEOM as influenced by land use and management practices has offered fragmented and sometimes contradictory information. It is concluded that the standardization of collection and extraction methods for DOM and WEOM measurements is crucial to reduce the uncertainty when comparing results from different studies. More research would also be required (i) under field conditions and especially in tropical ecosystems, (ii) to determine the biological significance of measured fluctuations in DOM and WEOM concentration and composition, and (iii) to elucidate the mechanisms determining DOM/WEOM dynamics following changes in land use and management practices.

TI  - A review of conservation tillage strategies for humid temperate regions
PY  - 1994
AB  - The development of conservation tillage in sub-humid to semi-arid climates originated from the need to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion. Descriptions of conservation tillage in the above climatic zones are generally based upon the degree of soil surface residue cover. There is a need, however, to characterize conservation tillage for humid temperate climates, especially those with a cool season, subject to excessive precipitation and high levels of crop residue. Appropriate conservation tillage practices for such regions may make judicious use of cultivation to address soil and climatic constraints, and use tillage for straw incorporation to avoid the adverse effects of excessive crop residues on the growth of the following crop. Interaction between soil type and precipitation, in humid climates, emphasizes the need to group soil or land resources according to soil tillage requirement. Major attributes of conservation tillage in humid climates would be the continuum of live soil cover especially in the non-crop period, use of mulches and residue incorporation, and speed and efficiency of crop establishment. These attributes can be achieved through minimum tillage, rotational tillage, and attention to tillage timing. Besides their ability to conserve soil, conservation tillage practices in humid regions should also address farming system sustainability in terms of energy conservation and nutrient management.

TI  - Cattle selected for lower residual feed intake have reduced daily methane production.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Seventy-six Angus steers chosen from breeding lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were studied to quantify the relationship between RFI and the daily rate of methane production (MPR). A 70-d feeding test using a barley-based ration was conducted in which the voluntary DMI, feeding characteristics, and BW of steers were monitored. The estimated breeding value (EBV) for RFI (RFI(EBV)) for each steer had been calculated from 70-d RFI tests conducted on its parents. Methane production rate (g/d) was measured on each steer using SF(6) as a tracer gas in a series of 10-d measurement periods. Daily DMI of steers was lower during the methane measurement period than when methane was not being measured (11.18 vs. 11.88 kg; P = 0.001). A significant relationship existed between MPR and RFI when RFI (RFI(15d)) was estimated over the 15 d when steers were harnessed for methane collection (MPR = 13.3 x RFI(15d) + 179; r(2) = 0.12; P = 0.01). Animals expressing lower RFI had lower daily MPR. The relationship established between MPR and RFI(15d) was used to calculate a reduction in daily methane emission of 13.38 g accompanied a 1 kg/d reduction in RFI(EBV) in cattle consuming ad libitum a diet of 12.1 MJ of ME/kg. The magnitude of this emission reduction was between that predicted on the basis of intake reduction alone (18 g x d(-1) x kg of DMI(-1)) and that predicted by a model incorporating steer midtest BW and level of intake relative to maintenance (5 g x d(-1) x kg of DMI(-1)). Comparison of data from steers exhibiting the greatest (n = 10) and lowest (n = 10) RFI(15d) showed the low RFI(15d) group to not only have lower MPR (P = 0.017) but also reduced methane cost of growth (by 41.2 g of CH(4)/kg of ADG; P = 0.09). Although the opportunity to abate livestock MPR by selection against RFI seems great, RFI explained only a small proportion of the observed variation in MPR. A genotype x nutrition interaction can be anticipated, and the MPR:RFI(EBV) relationship will need to be defined over a range of diet types to account for this.

TI  - Short-term soil CO2 emission after conventional and reduced tillage of a no-till sugar cane area in southern Brazil
PY  - 2006
AB  - The impact of tillage systems on soil CO2 emission is a complex issue as different soil types are managed in various ways, from no-till to intensive land preparation. In southern Brazil, the adoption of a new management option has arisen most recently, with no-tillage as well as no burning of crops residues left on soil surface after harvesting, especially in sugar cane areas. Although such practice has helped to restore soil carbon, the tillage impact on soil carbon loss in such areas has not been widely investigated. This study evaluated the effect of moldboard plowing followed by offset disk harrow and chisel plowing on clay oxisol CO2 emission in a sugar cane field treated with no-tillage and high crop residues input in the last 6 years. Emissions after tillage were compared to undisturbed soil CO2 emissions during a 4-week period by using an LI-6400 system coupled to a portable soil chamber. Conventional tillage caused the highest emission during almost the whole period studied, except for the efflux immediately following tillage, when the reduced plot produced the highest peak. The lowest emissions were recorded 7 days after tillage, at the end of a dry period, when soil moisture reached its lowest rate. A linear regression between soil CO2 effluxes and soil moisture in the no-till and conventional plots corroborate the fact that moisture, and not soil temperature, was a controlling factor. Total soil CO2 loss was huge and indicates that the adoption of reduced tillage would considerably decrease soil carbon dioxide emission in our region, particularly during the summer season and when growers leave large amounts of crop residues on the soil surface. Although it is known that crop residues are important for restoring soil carbon, our result indicates that an amount equivalent to approximately 30% of annual crop carbon residues could be transferred to the atmosphere, in a period of 4 weeks only, when conventional tillage is applied on no-tilled soils.

TI  - NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM CORN–SOYBEAN SYSTEMS IN THE MIDWEST
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil N2O emissions from three corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems in central Iowa were measured from the spring of 2003 through February 2005. The three managements systems evaluated were full-width tillage (fall chisel plow, spring disk), no-till, and no-till with a rye (Secale cereale L. ‘Rymin’) winter cover crop. Four replicate plots of each treatment were established within each crop of the rotation and both crops were present in each of the two growing seasons. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured weekly during the periods of April through October, biweekly during March and November, and monthly in December, January, and February. Two polyvinyl chloride rings (30-cm diameter) were installed in each plot (in and between plant rows) and were used to support soil chambers during the gas flux measurements. Flux measurements were performed by placing vented chambers on the rings and collecting gas samples 0, 15, 30, and 45 min following chamber deployment. Nitrous oxide fluxes were computed from the change in N2O concentration with time, after accounting for diffusional constraints. We observed no significant tillage or cover crop effects on N2O flux in either year. In 2003 mean N2O fluxes were 2.7, 2.2, and 2.3 kg N2O-N ha 21 yr 21 from the soybean plots under chisel plow, no-till, and no-till 1 cover crop, respectively. Emissions from the chisel plow, no-till, and no-till 1 cover crop plots planted to corn averaged 10.2, 7.9, and 7.6 kg N2O-N ha 21 yr 21 , respectively. In 2004 fluxes from both crops were higher than in 2003, but fluxes did not differ among the management systems. Fluxes from the corn plots were significantly higher than from the soybean plots in both years. Comparison of our results with estimates calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default emission factor of 0.0125 indicate that the estimated fluxes underestimate measured emissions by a factor of 3 at our sites.

PY  - 2007
AB  - The increasing scientific consensus on global warming, together with the precautionary principle and the fear of non-linear climate transitions is leading to increasing action to mitigate global warming. To help mitigate global warming, carbon storage by forests is often mentioned as the only or the best way to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. This book presents evidence that tropical grasslands, which cover 50% of the earth’s surface, are as important as forests for the sequestration of carbon. Results are reported of a large five year on-farm research project carried out in Latin America (Colombia, Costa Rica). Soil and vegetation carbon stocks of long-established pasture, fodder bank and silvopastoral systems on commercial farms were compared with those of adjacent forest and degraded land. The objective was to identify production systems that both increase livestock productivity and farm income and, at the same time, contribute to a reduction of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. The project was carried out in four ecosystems: the Andean hillsides of the semi-evergreen forest in Colombia; the Colombian humid Amazonian tropical forest ecosystem; the sub-humid tropical forest ecosystem on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica; and the humid tropical forest ecosystem on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica.

TI  - Effect of condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus on the nutritive value of pasture for sheep
PY  - 1997
AB  - The extent to which condensed tannins (CT) in Lotus corniculatus were able to affect protein degradation and the nutritive value of pasture were evaluated at Palmerston North, New Zealand in 1992 in an indoor feeding trial with sheep and using in vitro incubations. The feeding trial involved three groups of seven young wether sheep held indoors in metabolism crates for the 32-day experimental period with one group fed freshly cut ryegrass/clover pasture (Pasture group) whilst the other two groups received a mixture of c . 37% freshly cut Lotus corniculatus and 63% pasture (dry matter (DM) basis). One of the latter groups was given twice daily oral drenches of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to bind with and remove the effects of the CT (PEG group) whilst the remaining sheep (Tannin group) were not drenched. Intakes of sheep given the mixed diets were constrained to that of the pasture group. The CT concentration in the lotus was 26·1 g/kg DM so that the mixed diets contained c . 10g CT/kg DM. Effects of CT on digestion and sheep performance were minimal. Apparent digestibility of N was lower in the Tannin group (76·4%) than PEG (79·8%) or Pasture (79·4%) sheep ( P <0·001), but there were no differences in DM digestibility (75%) or wool growth from mid-side patches. Rumen ammonia and soluble protein concentrations appeared to be similar in PEG and Tannin sheep and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were similar in all groups (100 mmol/l). For incubations in vitro , several ratios of Lotus corniculatus : pasture were used to determine the effects of CT on precipitation of soluble proteins and the net yield of ammonia and gas with and without PEG. Homogenates of Lotus corniculatus leaves and pasture showed that 50% of soluble protein was precipitated by 1·3% CT in homogenate DM and there was a substantial decrease in in vitro degradation to ammonia when lotus leaf accounted for 33% or more of DM with pasture. This work emphasises the need for caution when extrapolating from in vitro to the in vivo situation and suggests that 1% CT from Lotus corniculatus may be insufficient to affect the nutritive value of fresh forages for sheep.

TI  - Total soil C and N sequestration in a grassland following 10 years of free air CO2 enrichment
PY  - 2006
AB  - Soil C sequestration may mitigate rising levels of atmospheric CO2. However, it has yet to be determined whether net soil C sequestration occurs in N-rich grasslands exposed to long-term elevated CO2. This study examined whether N-fertilized grasslands exposed to elevated CO2 sequestered additional C. For 10 years, Lolium perenne, Trifolium repens, and the mixture of L. perenne/T. repens grasslands were exposed to ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (35 and 60Pa pCO2). The applied CO2 was depleted in d 13 C and the grasslands received low (140kgha � 1 ) and high (560kgha � 1 ) rates of 15 N-labeled fertilizer. Annually collected soil samples from the top 10cm of the grassland soils allowed us to follow the sequestration of new C in the surface soil layer. For the first time, we were able to collect dual-labeled soil samples to a depth of 75cm after 10 years of elevated CO2 and determine the total amount of new soil C and N sequestered in the whole soil profile. Elevated CO2, N-fertilization rate, and species had no significant effect on total soil C. On average 9.4Mg new Cha � 1 was sequestered, which corresponds to 26.5% of the total C. The mean residence time of the C present in the 0‐10cm soil depth was calculated at 4.6 � 1.5 and 3.1 � 1.1 years for L. perenne and T. repens soil, respectively. After 10 years, total soil N and C in the 0‐75cm soil depth was unaffected by CO2 concentration, Nfertilization rate and plant species. The total amount of 15 N-fertilizer sequestered in the 0‐75cm soil depth was also unaffected by CO2 concentration, but significantly more 15 N was sequestered in the L. perenne compared with the T. repens swards: 620 vs. 452kgha � 1 at the high rate and 234 vs. 133kgha � 1 at the low rate of N fertilization. Intermediate values of 15 N recovery were found in the mixture. The fertilizer derived N amounted to 2.8% of total N for the low rate and increased to 8.6% for the high rate of N application. On average, 13.9% of the applied 15 N-fertilizer was recovered in the 0‐75cm soil depth in soil organic matter in the L. perenne sward, whereas 8.8% was recovered under the T. repens swards, indicating that the N2-fixing T. repens system was less effective in sequestering applied N than the non-N2-fixing L. perenne system. Prolonged elevated CO2 did not lead to an increase in whole soil profile C and N in these fertilized pastures. The potential use of fertilized and regular cut pastures as a net soil C sink under longterm elevated CO2 appears to be limited and will likely not significantly contribute to the mitigation of anthropogenic C emissions.

TI  - Climate change effects on soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions in Abies fabri forest of subalpine, southwest China
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Abies fabri forest on the eastern slope of the Gongga Mountain is a typical subalpine dark coniferous forest in southwestern China. The soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions in the A. fabri forest in future climates were simulated by the Forest-DNDC (denitrification-decomposition) model. Three future climate scenarios (B1, A1B and A2) predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were selectively investigated. The simulation showed that at elevated temperature and precipitation, the annual change of soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased in the forest floor pool but increased in the mineral soil pool. The increases in the CO(2), N(2)O and NO emissions from soil were also quantified. The results indicated that elevated temperature and precipitation influenced the soil carbon dynamics, and significantly increased the greenhouse gas emissions from the soil in the A. fabri forest of subalpine.

TI  - GM Crop Cultivation in Ireland: Ecological and Economic Considerations
PY  - 2005
AB  - Like many states in the European Union, Ireland has yet to fully commit itself to genetically modified (GM) crop technology. The general position of the Irish Government is ‘positive but precautionary’. However, with the European-wide de-facto moratorium on commercial production of GM crops now ended, many strategically important decisions regarding the commercial deployment of such crops and their co-existence with conventional/organic crops need to be considered. To date, little research on the environmental impact of GM crops has been carried out in Ireland, and the provision of relevant local information lags far behind that available in other countries in the European Union. In this paper, we discuss much of the new ecological and economic data that have emerged since the moratorium on GM crops was introduced in 1998, assess the likely impacts of pest-oriented GM crops should they be introduced to Ireland and examine criteria for post-release monitoring. We also describe the likely commercial demand for these crops and the consequent priorities for ecological research. We argue that the impact of GM technology needs to be assessed in relation to the environmental impact of modern agriculture as a whole. Public unease in relation to this technology may be addressed if adequate resources are made available for independent Irish research on the issue.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon and bioavailability of N and P as indicators of soil quality
PY  - 2005
AB  - Soil quality has become an important issue in soil science. Considerable attempts have been made to define soil quality, but a general concept has not yet been accepted by the scientific community. The selection of quantitative indices for soil quality is extremely difficult, and a considerable number of chemical, physical, and biochemical properties have been suggested as potential indicators of soil quality. Because soil organic matter (SOM) can be associated with different soil chemical, physical and biological processes, it has been widely considered as one of the best soil quality indicator. Land use can significantly influence dynamics of organic carbon and N, P, and S cycle. However, changes in total soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in response to land use may be difficult to detect because of the natural soil variability. In the short to medium term, biological properties and readily decomposable fractions of SOC, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), are much more sensitive to soil management than is SOM as a whole, and can be used as a key indicator of soil natural functions. Despite the fact that labile C accounts for a small portion of the total organic matter in the soils, DOC is the most mobile and important C-source for microorganisms, and can easily reflect the effects of land use on soil quality. Although several methods are used to characterize DOC, the factors influencing mineralization and bioavailability of elements associated with organic matter (N, P, and S) remains unclear. Future research should focus on the processes that govern DOC and nutrient dynamics and how they affect soil quality.

TI  - Relationship between soil structure and runoff/soil loss after 24 years of conservation tillage
PY  - 2006
AB  - A better understanding of tillage and stubble management effects on surface soil structure is vital for the development of effective soil conservation practices for the long-term. Relationships between aspects of soil structure and runoff/soil loss were investigated in 24 year old field experiment on an Oxic Paleustalf, in NSW, Australia. Two tillage/stubble management systems were compared, namely direct drilled/stubble retained (DD/SR) versus conventional tillage/stubble burnt (CC/SB). Tillage and stubble burning significantly increased bulk density and decreased the macro-aggregate stability, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and total porosity, particularly macroporosity (>60 μm). For the 0–5 cm layer, DD/SR had significantly higher water stability of macro-aggregates >2 mm than CC/SB (165 g/kg versus 78 g/kg), and the volume of pore space of diameter >60 μm at 0–5 cm depth was significantly greater (more than 11%) for DD/SR than for CC/SB. Under simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) and the removal of surface stubble, both runoff and soil loss were significantly higher under CC/SB compared to DD/SR. The infiltration rate at the end of the experiment under DD/SR was 3.7 times that of CC/SB (85 mm/h versus 23 mm/h). There were significant correlations between the proportion of soil particles >0.25 mm measured after wetting by rain and both final infiltration rate (P < 0.001) and soil loss (P < 0.001). It was concluded that 24 years of direct drilling and stubble retained practices significantly reduced runoff and soil erosion hazards, due to a fundamental change in soil structure, viz. higher soil aggregate stability and higher macroporosity of the surface soil.

TI  - Tillage and seasonal emissions of CO2, N2O and NO across a seed bed and at the field scale in a Mediterranean climate
PY  - 2009
AB  - Whereas the contribution of agriculture to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is well known, especially of NOx gases following the application of N-fertilizer additions, quantitative estimates across fields remain uncertain. Here, we quantified CO2 ,N 2O, and NO emissions from an irrigated field under standard tillage and in a field recently converted (� 5 years) to minimum tillage in Yolo County, California, under a Mediterranean climate. We focused on the spatiotemporal variation of GHG emissions among positions across a seed bed and at the field scale. Seasonal CO2 and N2O fluxes ranged from 4.6 to 52.4 kg C ha � 1 day � 1 and 0 to 23.7 g N ha � 1 day � 1 , respectively. There was a significant seasonal pattern of CO2 emissions as a function of crop growth, while the level of CO2 flux rates varied annually by crop type and the previous year’s soil C inputs. The seasonal N2O emissions coincided with N fertilization placement and irrigation events. With the exception of immediately after N fertilizing, NO emissions were on average 2–33 times lower than N2O emissions. Whereas gross effects of tillage and position in the seed bed on CO2 and N2O emissions were not significant, the emissions were significantly different in a specific seed bed position because of an interaction between tillage and position in the seed bed. For example, N2O fluxes in the side dress position were significantly greater than fluxes from other seed bed positions, and were further accentuated by a significant tillage effect. At the field scale, soil-water content and temperature were generally related to both optimum CO2 and N2O emissions, but the relationships were highly variable. The results suggest that position-specific variations and interaction with tillage should be accounted for to improve the estimates of GHG emissions from irrigated soils.

TI  - Soil tillage enhanced CO2 and N2O emissions from loamy sand soil under spring barley
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Soil tillage intensity can be expected to affect the greenhouse gas balance of arable cropping systems through effects on soil physics and biology affecting soil carbon storage and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. The effects of conventional tillage (CT) with ploughing to 20 cm, reduced tillage (RT) with harrowing to 8–10 cm and direct drilling (DD) on CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from a loamy sand soil (8.1% clay, 3.5% organic matter) under spring barley undersown with ryegrass were measured by static chambers over a period of 113 days in spring and summer 2004 in a tillage experiment established in 2002 at Foulum, Denmark. There was a high temporal and spatial variation in both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, which made the comparisons of treatment effects on emissions on single dates difficult. However, this variation was reduced when the measurements were corrected for diurnal variation in the emissions and when emissions were cumulated over a longer period. Both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions decreased in the order CT > RT > DD. Compared with CT (40 kg C day −1 ) the cumulated CO 2 emissions during the 91 days after tillage were 21 and 25% lower for the RT and the DD treatments, respectively. The cumulated N 2 O emission from CT over the entire observation period (0.89 kg N ha −1 or 7.9 g N day −1 ) was about twice that of DD. The N 2 O emissions were significantly higher for CT compared with DD and RT, even before tillage and the difference increased after tillage, but decreased after fertilisation. Spring barley dry matter grain yields were reduced by 14% for RT and 27% for DD compared to CT. Measurements of soil mineral nitrogen (N) at sowing showed no difference between the treatments, and could thus not explain the differences in N 2 O emissions and crop N uptake. It is likely that tillage affected CO 2 emissions, N 2 O emissions and crop growth through different processes, where effects of soil compactness on root penetration and soil aeration and diffusivity on one side and soil organic matter turnover on the other side probably played key roles.

TI  - Soil carbon saturation: concept, evidence and evaluation
PY  - 2007
AB  - Current estimates of soil C storage potential are based on models or factors that assume linearity between C input levels and C stocks at steady-state, implying that SOC stocks could increase without limit as C input levels increase. However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state SOC stock with increasing C input levels suggesting that SOC can become saturated with respect to C input. We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in C input levels to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil C and C input used to model SOM dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in C input levels were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level. We conclude that the saturation of soil C does occur and therefore the greatest efficiency in soil C sequestration will be in soils further from C saturation.

TI  - Tillage, crop residue and N fertilizer effects on crop yield, nutrient uptake, soil quality and nitrous oxide gas emissions in a second 4-yr rotation cycle
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract An 8-yr (1998–2005) field experiment was conducted on a Gray Luvisol (Boralf) soil near Star City, Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine the effects of tillage (no-tillage – NT and conventional tillage – CT), straw management (straw retained – R and straw not retained – NR) and N fertilizer (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha −1 , except no N to pea ( Pisum sativum L.) phase of the rotation) on seed and straw yield, mass of N and C in crop, organic C and N, inorganic N and aggregation in soil, and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions for a second 4-yr rotation cycle (2002–2005). The plots were seeded to barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) in 2002, pea in 2003, wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004 and canola ( Brassica napus L.) in 2005. Seed, straw and chaff yield, root mass, and mass of N and C in crop increased with increasing N rate for barley in 2002, wheat in 2004 and canola in 2005. No-till produced greater seed (by 51%), straw (23%) and chaff (13%) yield of barley than CT in 2002, but seed yield for wheat in 2004, and seed and straw yield for canola in 2005 were greater under CT than NT. Straw retention increased seed (by 62%), straw (by 43%) and chaff (by 12%) yield, and root mass (by 11%) compared to straw removal for barley in 2002, wheat in 2004, and seed and straw yield for pea in 2003. No-till resulted in greater mass of N in seed, and mass of C in seed, straw, chaff and root than CT for barley in 2002, but mass of N and C were greater under CT than NT for wheat in 2004 and for canola in 2005 in many cases. Straw retention had greater mass of N and C in seed, straw, chaff and root in most cases compared to straw removal for barley in 2002, pea in 2003 and wheat in 2004. Soil moisture content in spring was higher under NT than CT and with R than NR in the 0–15 cm depth, with the highest moisture content in the NT + R treatment in many cases. After eight crop seasons, tillage and straw management had no effect on total organic C (TOC) and N (TON) in the 0–15 cm soil, but light fraction organic C (LFOC) and N (LFON), respectively, were greater by 1.275 Mg C ha −1 and 0.031 Mg N ha −1 with R than NR, and also greater by 0.563 Mg C ha −1 and 0.044 Mg N ha −1 under NT than CT. There was no effect of tillage, straw and N fertilization on the NH 4 -N in soil in most cases, but R treatment had higher NO 3 -N concentration in the 0–15 cm soil than NR. The NO 3 -N concentration in the 0–15, 15–30 and 30–60 cm soil layers increased (though small) with increasing N rate. The R treatment had 6.7% lower proportion of fine ( 38.0 mm) dry aggregates, and 4.5 mm larger mean weight diameter (MWD) compared to NR treatment. This suggests a lower potential for soil erosion when crop residues are retained. There was no beneficial effect of elimination of tillage on soil aggregation. The amount of N lost as N 2 O was higher from N-fertilized (580 g N ha −1 ) than from zero-N (155 g N ha −1 ) plots, and also higher in CT (398 g N ha −1 ) than NT (340 g N ha −1 ) in some cases. In conclusion, retaining crop residues along with no-tillage improved some soil properties and may also be better for the environment and the sustainability of high crop production. Nitrogen fertilization improved crop production and some soil quality attributes, but also increased the potential for NO 3 -N leaching and N 2 O-N emissions, especially when applied in excess of crop requirements.

TI  - Quantitative Trait Loci Analysis of Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Arabidopsis
PY  - 2003
AB  - Improving plant nitrogen (N) use efficiency or controlling soil N requires a better knowledge of the regulation of plant N metabolism. This could be achieved using Arabidopsis as a model genetic system, taking advantage of the natural variation available among ecotypes. Here, we describe an extensive study of N metabolism variation in the Bay-0 × Shahdara recombinant inbred line population, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We mapped QTL for traits such as shoot growth, total N, nitrate, and free-amino acid contents, measured in two contrasting N environments (contrasting nitrate availability in the soil), in controlled conditions. Genetic variation and transgression were observed for all traits, and most of the genetic variation was identified through QTL and QTL × QTL epistatic interactions. The 48 significant QTL represent at least 18 loci that are polymorphic between parents; some may correspond to known genes from the N metabolic pathway, but others represent new genes controlling or interacting with N physiology. The correlations between traits are dissected through QTL colocalizations: The identification of the individual factors contributing to the regulation of different traits sheds new light on the relations among these characters. We also point out that the regulation of our traits is mostly specific to the N environment (N availability). Finally, we describe four interesting loci at which positional cloning is feasible.

TI  - Varietal differences in perennial ryegrass for nitrogen use efficiency in leaf growth following defoliation: performance in flowing solution culture and its relationship to yield under simulated grazing in the field
PY  - 1997
AB  - Varietal differences in rates of NO3 uptake and remobilization of nitrogen (N) during a cycle of severe defoliation and regrowth were assessed in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) varieties Ba11778, Aberelan, Talbot and Gator. Plants were grown in flowing solution culture for 34 days, prior to a 30 d treatment period, including 21 d of regrowth. Net uptake of NO3 was measured continuously from solutions maintained automatically at 10 mmol m-3NO3.15 N-labelled NO3
 3 was supplied to the plants in situ for either 21 h immediately prior to defoliation, or for 7-11 days afterwards, to measure remobilization of N from roots and stubble into the regrowing leaves. The four varieties differed only slightly in total dry matter production over 30 d, but varied substantially in post-defoliation specific growth rate by the leaf fraction. Gator was the lowest ( 0.11 g g-1 d-1), Ba11778 the highest ( 0.15 g g-1 d-1) and Aberelan and Talbot intermediate in leaf regrowth rate. Varieties did not vary significantly in shoot: root dry weight ratio, but the rate of NO3 uptake per unit of leaf fresh weight during regrowth was 27% lower in Ba11778 than in Gator. Leaves of Ba11778 and Aberelan had a lower organic N concentration in the dry matter at the end of the regrowth period than Talbot, which, in turn, had a lower concentration than Gator. Varieties differed in amount of leaf dry matter produced per unit of N absorbed by the plants after defoliation, the values (g g-1 N) being Ba11778 (22.6 ), Aberelan (20.7), Talbot (18.3) and Gator (16.7). More N was remobilized from the roots than from the stubble after defoliation. There were no significant differences among varieties in the amount and rate of N remobilization following defoliation. In earlier field experiments employing frequent cutting to simulate grazing, Ba11778 and Aberelan yielded at least 10% more dry matter annually than Talbot which, in turn, outyielded the amenity variety Gator by a similar amount. Thus the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that the efficiency of N use in leaf growth is an important factor determining genetic variation in productivity under frequent defoliation in the field when the herbage produced consists primarily of leaf.

TI  - Tillage Effects on Soil Organic Carbon Fractions in Mediterranean Dryland Agroecosystems
PY  - 2008
AB  - Under semiarid conditions, soil quality and productivity can be improved by enhancing soil organic matter content by means of alternative management practices. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of no-till (NT) and cropping intensification as alternative soil practices to increase soil organic C (SOC). At the same time, we studied the influence of these management practices on two SOC fractions (particulate organic matter C, POM-C, and the mineral-associated C, Min-C), in semiarid agroecosystems of the Ebro River valley. Soil samples were collected from five soil layers (0-5-, 5-10-, 10-20-, 20-30-, 30-40-cm depth) during July 2005 at three long-term tillage experiments located at different sites in the Ebro River valley (northeast Spain). Soil bulk density, SOC concentration and content, SOC stratification ratio, POM-C, and Min-C were measured. Higher soil bulk density was observed under NT than under reduced tillage (RT), subsoil tillage (ST), or conventional tillage (CT). At the soil surface (0-5-cm depth), the highest total SOC concentration, POM-C, and Min-C were measured under NT, followed by RT, ST, and CT, respectively. In the whole soil profile (0-40 cm), similarly, slightly greater SOC content was measured under NT than under CT with the exception of the Selvanera site, where deep subsoil tillage combined with moldboard plowing accumulated more SOC than NT. In semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems where CT consists in moldboard plowing, NT is a viable management practice to increase SOC.

TI  - Fluxes of nitrous oxide from soil under different crop rotations and tillage systems in the South of Brazil
PY  - 2008
AB  - The zero tillage (ZT) system is used in a large area (>24 Mha) of crop production in Brazil. This management system can contribute to soil C sequestration, but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under ZT compared to conventional tillage (CT), which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission of N2O from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18-year-old experiment conducted on a Rhodic Ferralsol in the South of Brazil. Fluxes of N2O were measured over two years using static-closed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations. Soil water filled pore space (%WFPS) and soil mineral N were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature. Estimates of N2O emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the IPCC direct emission factor (EF1 = 1%) to the amounts of N added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues. Fluxes of N2O were relatively low, apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements. No relationship between N2O fluxes and %WFPS or mineral N were observed. Nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation. For the crop rotation receiving high rates of N fertiliser in the second year, field-measured N2O emissions were significantly underestimated by the IPCC emission factor 1 (EF1). For the other treatments measured N2O emissions fell within the EF1 uncertainty range, but always considerably lower than the EF1 estimate, which suggests IPCC EF1 overestimates true N2O emissions for the Ferralsol under evaluation.

TI  - Variations in soil microbial biomass and N availability due to residue and tillage management in a dryland rice agroecosystem.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Seasonal changes in the levels of soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), N-mineralization rate and available-N concentration were studied in rice-barley supporting tropical dryland (rainfed) agroecosystem under six combinations of tillage (conventional, minimum and zero tillage) and crop residue manipulation (retained or removed) conditions. Highest levels of soil MBC and MBN (368-503 and 38.2-59.7 m gg ˇ1 , respectively) were obtained in minimum tillage residue retained (MTaR) treatment and lowest levels (214-264 and 20.3-27.1 m gg ˇ1 , respectively) in conventional tillage residue removed (CTR, control) treatment. Along with residue retention tillage reduction from conventional to zero increased the levels of MBC and MBN (36-82 and 29-104% over control, respectively). The proportion of MBC and MBN in soil organic C and total N contents increased significantly in all treatments compared to control. This increase (28% in case of C and 33% N) was maximum in MTaR and minimum (10% for C and N both) in minimum tillage residue removed (MTR) treatment. In all treatments concentrations of N in microbial biomass were greater at seedling stage, thereafter these concentrations decreased drastically (21-38%) at grain-forming stage of both crops. In residue removed treatments, N-mineralization rates were maximum during the seedling stage of crops and then decreased through the crop maturity. In residue retained treatments, however, N-mineralization rates were lower than in residue removed treatments at seedling stage of both crops. At grain-forming stage in all instances the N-mineralization rates in residue retained treatments considerably exceeded the rates in corresponding residue removed treatments. Tillage reduction and residue retention both increased the proportion of organic C and total N present in soil organic matter as microbial biomass. Microbial immobilization of available-N during the early phase of crops and its pulsed release later during the period of greater N demand of crops enhanced the degree of synchronization between crop demand and N supply. The maximum enhancement effects were recorded in the minimum tillage along with residue retained treatment. In the dryland agroecosystem studied, two management practices in combination proved more advantageous than either practice alone in maintaining soil fertility levels. For soil fertility amelioration in dryland agroecosystems with least dependence upon chemical fertilizer input, post-harvest retention of about 20 cm shoot biomass (accounting for 25-40% aboveground biomass) of previous crop and its incorporation in soil through minimum tillage in the succeeding crop is suggested, especially in the case of cereal. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Carbon sequestration determined using farm scale carbon balance and eddy covariance
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Studies using eddy covariance have shown grasslands to be both sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). However, such studies do not take into account the exports of carbon (C), such as in meat and milk and imports of C, such as off-farm derived C in cattle feed supplement. By coupling eddy covariance results with farm management data we quantified the farm scale C balance during 2004 for two dairy farms in South West Ireland. The system boundary for inputs and outputs of C is the farm perimeter. Carbon sequestration is determined as the difference between all C inputs and C outputs. Carbon inputs are similar in both farms with net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (2.9 ± 0.5 t C ha −1  year −1 ) accounting for 88 and 81% of C inputs in Farms A and B, respectively. Carbon in concentrate feed accounts for 12 and 19% of C inputs in Farms A and B, respectively. Respiration by cattle during the winter housing period, and respiration by cows during milking throughout the grazing season, are the largest C outputs and account for approximately half of C outputs on both farms. The other major sources of C output are milk, CH 4 produced by enteric fermentation and emitted during slurry spreading and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streamflow. Carbon in meat and CH 4 emissions from dung (both in the farmyard and fields) and animal slurry in farmyard storage are minor sources of C output. The annual total C inputs are 3.30 and 3.58 t C ha −1 and the total C outputs are 1.25 and 1.43 t C ha −1 in Farms A and B, respectively. The net difference is 2.05 and 2.15 t C ha −1 in Farms A and B, respectively. This suggests that both farms were net C sinks for 2004. Further work on below ground process and soil C turnover is required to determine if this C sink estimate is reflected in changes in soil C stocks. Furthermore, we estimate the global warming potential (GWP) of this grassland to be a sink for ∼1 t CO 2  equiv. ha −1  year −1 .

TI  - Identification of traits to improve the nitrogen-use efficiency of wheat genotypes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Nitrogen (N) fertilizer represents a significant cost for the grower and may also have environmental impacts through nitrate leaching and N2O (a greenhouse gas) emissions associated with denitrification. The objectives of this study were to analyze the genetic variability in N-use efficiency (grain dry matter (DM) yield per unit N available from soil and fertilizer; NUE) in winter wheat and identify traits for improved NUE for application in breeding. Fourteen UK and French cultivars and two French advanced breeding lines were tested in a 2 year/four site network comprising different locations in France and in the UK. Detailed growth analysis was conducted at anthesis and harvest in experiments including DM and N partitioning. Senescence of either the flag leaf or the whole leaf canopy was assessed from a visual score every 3–4 days from anthesis to complete canopy senescence. The senescence score was fitted against thermal time using a five parameters monomolecular-logistic equation allowing the estimation of the timing of the onset and the rate of post-anthesis senescence. In each experiment, grain yield was reduced under low N (LN), with an average reduction of 2.2 t ha−1 (29%). Significant N × genotype level interaction was observed for NUE. Crop N uptake at harvest on average was reduced from 227 kg N ha−1 under high N (HN) to 109 kg N ha−1 under LN conditions while N-utilization efficiency (grain DM yield per unit crop N uptake at harvest; NUtE) increased from 34.0 to 52.1 kg DM kg−1 N. Overall genetic variability in NUE under LN related mainly to differences in NUtE rather than N-uptake efficiency (crop N uptake at harvest per unit N available from soil and fertilizer; NUpE). However, at one site there was also a positive correlation between NUpE and NUE at LN in both years. Moreover, across the 2 year/four site network, the N × genotype effect for NUpE partly explained the N × genotype effect for grain yield and NUE. Averaging across the 16 genotypes, the timing of onset of senescence explained 86% of the variation in NUtE amongst site-season-N treatment combinations. The linear regression of onset of senescence on NutE amongst genoytpes was not significant under HN, but at three of the four sites was significant under LN explaining 32–70% of the phenotypic variation amongst genotypes in NutE. Onset of senescence amongst genotypes was negatively correlated with the efficiency with which above-ground N at anthesis was remobilized to the grain under LN. It is concluded that delaying the onset of post-anthesis senescence may be an important trait for increasing grain yield of wheat grown under low N supply.

TI  - Winter carbon dioxide fluxes in humid-temperate pastures
PY  - 2007
AB  - Because of their vast size, grazing lands have the potential to sequester significant quantities of carbon, slowing the increase in atmospheric CO2 and reducing the risk of global warming. Although CO2 uptake during the growing season can be substantial, losses during winter months reduce annual sequestration, potentially turning grazing lands into net carbon sources. The goal of this research was to quantify the magnitude of winter fluxes for humid-temperate pastures in the northeastern USA. The study was conducted from 2003 to 2005 on two pastures in the ridge and valley region of central Pennsylvania, one dominated by a mix of cool-season grasses and the other transitioning from an alfalfa to mixed-grass pasture. Pasture-scale CO2 fluxes were quantified using eddy covariance techniques. The alfalfa pasture was less of a CO2 source to the atmosphere during winter months (1 December to 31 March) than the grass pasture, averaging 2.68 g CO2 m−2 day−1 compared with 3.09 g CO2 m−2 day−1 for the grass pasture. Cumulative efflux for the winter months averaged 326 g CO2 m−2 (88 g C m−2) for the alfalfa and 375 g CO2 m−2 (101 g C m−2) for the grass pasture. In the absence of snow cover, eddy covariance measurements estimated that photosynthetic CO2 uptake occurred at temperatures below 0 °C. Canopy and leaf chamber measurements in the field and in controlled environments suggested minimum temperatures for photosynthetic CO2 uptake of about −4 °C. Even when daytime uptake occurred, nighttime efflux from the system was greater so that the pastures remained CO2 sources throughout the winter.

TI  - Soil physical properties and wheat root growth as affected by no-tillage and conventional tillage systems in a Mediterranean environment of Chile
PY  - 2008
AB  - No-tillage systems affect soil properties depending on the soil, climate, and the time since its implementation. In heavy no-tilled soils a surface compacted layer is commonly found. Such layer can affect root growth and soil water infiltration. In several cases, surface organic carbon can buffer these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 4- and 7-year-old conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) treatments on soil physical properties, root growth, and wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) yield in an Entic Haploxeroll of Central Chile. In both tillage treatments we study soil water retention, bulk density (rb), soil particle density (rs), soil water infiltration, mean-weight diameter of soil aggregates (MWD), penetration resistance, grain yield, and root length density (Lv) up to a depth of 15 cm. The MWD and the penetration resistance were higher under NTas compared to CT. For the top 5 cm of soil, Lv was greater under NTas compared to CT. Differences of Lv between NTand CTwere 2.09, 7.60, and 4.31 cm root cm � 3 soil during the two leaves, flowering and grain filling phenological stages, respectively. Generally, the effect of NTon these properties was more evident near the soil surface. In contrast, fast drainage macropores, rs, and soil water infiltration rates were higher under CT than under NT. Tillage treatments did not significantly affect rb and yield. A longer time under no-tillage enhanced aggregate stability, however, other soil physical properties were negatively affected. # 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from long-term tillage systems in continuous corn and corn–soybean rotations
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Although the Midwestern United States is one of the world's major agricultural production areas, few studies have assessed the effects of the region's predominant tillage and rotation practices on greenhouse gas emissions from the soil surface. Our objectives were to (a) assess short-term chisel (CP) and moldboard plow (MP) effects on soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes relative to no-till (NT) and, (b) determine how tillage and rotation interactions affect seasonal gas emissions in continuous corn and corn–soybean rotations on a poorly drained Chalmers silty clay loam (Typic Endoaquoll) in Indiana. The field experiment itself began in 1975. Short-term gas emissions were measured immediately before, and at increasing hourly intervals following primary tillage in the fall of 2004, and after secondary tillage in the spring of 2005, for up to 168 h. To quantify treatment effects on seasonal emissions, gas fluxes were measured at weekly or biweekly intervals for up to 14 sampling dates in the growing season for corn. Both CO 2 and CH 4 emissions were significantly affected by tillage but not by rotation in the short-term following tillage, and by rotation during the growing season. Soil temperature and moisture conditions in the surface 10 cm were significantly related to CO 2 emissions, although the proportion of variation explained by temperature and moisture was generally very low (never exceeded 27%) and varied with the tillage system being measured. In the short-term, CO 2 emissions were significantly higher for CP than MP and NT. Similarly, mean seasonal CO 2 emissions during the 2-year period were higher for CP (6.2 Mg CO 2 -C ha −1  year −1 ) than for MP (5.9 Mg CO 2 -C ha −1  year −1 ) and NT (5.7 Mg CO 2 -C ha −1  year −1 ). Both CP and MP resulted in low net CH 4 uptake (7.6 and 2.4 kg CH 4 -C ha −1  year −1 , respectively) while NT resulted in net emissions of 7.7 kg CH 4 -C ha −1  year −1 . Mean emissions of CO 2 were 16% higher from continuous corn than from rotation corn during the two growing seasons. After 3 decades of consistent tillage and crop rotation management for corn and soybean producing grain yields well above average in the Midwest, continuous NT production in the corn–soybean rotation was identified as the system with the least soil-derived C emissions to the atmosphere from among those evaluated prior to and during corn production.

TI  - The potential to mitigate global warming with no‐tillage management is only realized when practised in the long term
PY  - 2004
AB  - No-tillage (NT) management has been promoted as a practice capable of offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of its ability to sequester carbon in soils. However, true mitigation is only possible if the overall impact of NT adoption reduces the net global warming potential (GWP) determined by fluxes of the three major biogenic GHGs (i.e. CO2, N2O, and CH4). We compiled all available data of soil-derived GHG emission comparisons between conventional tilled (CT) and NT systems for humid and dry temperate climates. Newly converted NT systems increase GWP relative to CT practices, in both humid and dry climate regimes, and longer-term adoption (>10 years) only significantly reduces GWP in humid climates. Mean cumulative GWP over a 20-year period is also reduced under continuous NT in dry areas, but with a high degree of uncertainty. Emissions of N2O drive much of the trend in net GWP, suggesting improved nitrogen management is essential to realize the full benefit from carbon storage in the soil for purposes of global warming mitigation. Our results indicate a strong time dependency in the GHG mitigation potential of NT agriculture, demonstrating that GHG mitigation by adoption of NT is much more variable and complex than previously considered, and policy plans to reduce global warming through this land management practice need further scrutiny to ensure success.

TI  - Simulation of fluxes of greenhouse gases from European grasslands using the DNDC model
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural management of grasslands results in sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs, particularly CO2, N2O and CH4). Here, we used a process-based model (DNDC) to estimate the fluxes of the major GHGs from grasslands at 0.5° resolution across Europe, and combined these to produce a spatially explicit estimate of the total global warming potential (GWP, expressed in CO2 equivalents). The DNDC model [Li, C., Frolking, S., Crocker, G.J., Grace, P.R., Klir, J., Korchens, M., Poulton, P.R., 1997. Simulating trends in soil organic carbon in long-term experiments using the DNDC model. Geoderma 81, 45–60] simulates carbon and nitrogen cycling in agro-ecosystems at a sub-daily time step and consists of four interacting submodels: soil and climate (including water flow and leaching), plant growth, decomposition, and denitrification. Input data sets for grassland area, climate, nitrogen deposition, and soil properties were collated. The typical current grassland management regime was established for ten biogeographical regions on the basis of questionnaires sent to national experts, and used to derive model input data. A 20-year simulation was carried out using DNDC for each site. Simple estimates of methane emissions from grazing livestock were made according to the IPCC Tier 1 method. Most grassland areas are net sources for GHGs in terms of total global warming potential—the beneficial effect of sequestering carbon in soil is outweighed by the emissions of N2O from soil and (predominantly) CH4 emissions from livestock. The net effect of European grasslands on GWP (emission of 23 Tg C year−1) corresponds to a 2.5% increase on the EU-15 fossil fuel CO2 emissions (907 Tg C year−1)

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from a New Zealand cropped soil: tillage effects, spatial and seasonal variability
PY  - 2002
AB  - Agricultural practices are believed to be the major anthropogenic source of enhanced nitrous oxide (N 2O) gas emissions in New Zealand. Studies conducted in New Zealand generally suggest low N2O emission from pasture; however, there is little information for arable farming systems. This paper evaluates tillage and land use effects on N 2O emissions using a closed chamber technique at an Ohakea silt loam (Gleyic luvisol) where winter oats (Avena sativa L.)/fodder maize (Zea mays L.) was double-cropped for 5 years. The tillage types included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, and a permanent pasture (PP) was used as a control. Spatial variability in all treatments showed large inherent variations in N 2O fluxes (a mean CV = 119%), which reflected natural soil heterogeneity, and perhaps the measurement technique used rather than the real differences due to the tillage and cropping systems evaluated. On an annualised basis, N2O emissions measured from December 1998 to September 1999 from the PP (1.66 kg N2O-N/ha per year or 19 gN 2O-N/(m 2 h)) were significantly lower than the CT and NT fields averaging at 9.20 (or 105) and 12.0 (or 137) kg N2O-N/ha per year (or gN 2O-N/(m 2 h)), respectively. However, there were no differences in N2O emission rates between the CT and NT treatments. Seedbed preparation using a power harrow which followed within a few days of first ploughing the CT field reduced N 2O emissions by 65% within the first hour after power harrowing. However, N2O emission rates returned to the pre-power harrowing levels at the next sampling period, which was 1 month later. There was a strong relationship between log-transformed data of soil water content (SWC) and N2O emissions in all treatments with r = 0.73, 0.75 and 0.86 for the PP, CT and NT treatments, respectively. Seasonal variations in N2O emission from the PP were in the order of winter = autumn > summer. Although fluxes in the CT were higher in winter than in the autumn season, there were no differences between the summer and autumn data. The seasonal variations in N2O emission in the NT treatment were in the order of winter > autumn = summer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Sponsorship: EU Commission under contract EVK2-CT2001-00105 ?GREENGRASS? and contributed to COST Action 627- Carbon Storage in European Grasslands.The full greenhouse gas balance of nine contrasted grassland sites covering a major climatic gradient over Europe was measured during two complete years. The sites include a wide range of management regimes (rotational grazing, continuous grazing and mowing), the three main types of managed grasslands across Europe (sown, intensive permanent and semi-natural grassland) and contrasted nitrogen fertilizer supplies. At all sites, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was assessed using the eddy covariance technique. N2O emissions were monitored using various techniques (GC-cuvette systems, automated chambers and tunable diode laser) and CH4 emissions resulting from enteric fermentation of the grazing cattle were measured in situ at four sites using the SF6 tracer method. Averaged over the two measurement years, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) results show that the nine grassland plots displayed a net sink for atmospheric CO2 of ?240 ? 70 g C m?2 year?1 (mean ? confidence interval at p > 0.95). Because of organic C exports (from cut and removed herbage) being usually greater than C imports (from manure spreading), the average C storage (net biome productivity, NBP) in the grassland plots was estimated at ?104 ? 73 g C m?2 year?1, that is 43% of the atmospheric CO2 sink. On average of the 2 years, the grassland plots displayed annual N2O and CH4 (from enteric fermentation by grazing cattle) emissions, in CO2-C equivalents, of 14 ? 4.7 and 32 ? 6.8 g CO2-C equiv. m?2 year?1, respectively. Hence, when expressed in CO2-C equivalents, emissions of N2O and CH4 resulted in a 19% offset of the NEE sink activity. An attributed GHG balance has been calculated by subtracting from the NBP: (i) N2O and CH4 emissions occurring within the grassland plot and (ii) off-site emissions of CO2 and CH4 as a result of the digestion and enteric fermentation by cattle of the cut herbage. On average of the nine sites, the attributed GHG balance was not significantly different from zero (?85 ? 77 g CO2-C equiv. m?2 year?1). The net exchanges by the grassland ecosystems of CO2 and of GHG were highly correlated with the difference in carbon used by grazing versus cutting, indicating that cut grasslands have a greater on-site sink activity than grazed grasslands. However, the net biome productivity was significantly correlated to the total C used by grazing and cutting, indicating that, on average, net carbon storage declines with herbage utilisation for herbivores.Peer reviewe

TI  - Climate change affects farm nitrogen loss - A Swiss case study with a dynamic farm model
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract The response of arable crops and grasslands to climatic changes and increasing CO2 concentration has implications for the operation of farms, in particular for the management of resources such as nitrogen. A simple dynamic farm model (Stella© model ‘CH-Farm’) was used to analyze the shift in the ratio of N lost via leaching, denitrification and volatilization to N exported with products from dairy or arable production (here defined as relative N loss). The model was run for two types of farms typical of Swiss conditions. Growth parameters for two sequentially grown crops (winter wheat and maize) and grass were determined with the process-oriented models Pasture Simulation Model (PaSim) and CropSyst, respectively. CH-Farm was forced with two assumptions about the transient change in temperature and precipitation, and with or without CO2 effects. Relative N loss for the baseline was around 1.33 for the dairy-type farm and around 1.05 for the arable-type farm and increased progressively over the 100-year simulation period, with the largest shift in response to the dry/hot scenario. Soil N pools decreased with all scenarios, but at different rates. CO2 fertilization alleviated the effect of climate change due to increased productivity and N fixation in plants. Adjustment of the growth parameters to progressively increasing temperatures reduced the difference between farm types and positively affected relative N losses mainly through increased productivity and reduced fallow periods between crops. The results suggest that the impact of climate change on relative farm-level N loss depends on physiological adjustments to climatic scenarios, whereas the distribution of land between dairy and arable crop production is less important, and that simple cultivar adjustments can help to mitigate negative effects of climate change on farm-level N use.

TI  - Can biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) genes from perennial Leymus racemosus (Triticeae) combat nitrification in wheat farming?
PY  - 2007
AB  - Using a recombinant luminescent Nitrosomonas europaea assay to quantify biological nitrification inhibition (BNI), we found that a wild relative of wheat (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tzvelev) had a high BNI capacity and releases about 20 times more BNI compounds (about 30 ATU g−1 root dry weight 24 h−1) than Triticum aestivum L. (cultivated wheat). The root exudate from cultivated wheat has no inhibitory effect on nitrification when applied to soil; however, the root exudate from L. racemous suppressed  formation and kept more than 90% of the soil’s inorganic-N in the -form for 60 days. The high-BNI capacity of L. racemosus is mostly associated with chromosome Lr#n. Two other chromosomes Lr#J, and Lr#I also have an influence on BNI production. Tolerance of L. racemosus to  is controlled by chromosome 7Lr#1-1. Sustained release of BNI compounds occurred only in the presence of  in the root environment. Given the level of BNI production expressed in DALr#n and assuming normal plant growth, we estimated that nearly 87,500,000 ATU of BNI activity ha−1 day−1 could be released in a field of vigorously growing wheat; this amounts to the equivalent of the inhibitory effect from the application of 52.5 g of the synthetic nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (one AT unit of BNI activity is equivalent to 0.6 μg of nitrapyrin). At this rate of BNI production it would take only 19 days for a BNI-enabled wheat crop to produce the inhibitory power of a standard commercial application of nitrapyrin, 1 kg ha−1. The synthetic nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide, blocked specifically the AMO (ammonia monooxygenase) pathway, while the BNI from L. racemosus blocked the HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase) pathway in Nitrosomonas. Here we report the first finding of high production of BNI in a wild relative of any cereal and its successful introduction and expression in cultivated wheat. These results demonstrate the potential for empowering the new generation of wheat cultivars with high-BNI capacity to control nitrification in wheat-production systems

TI  - Considering the influence of sequestration duration and carbon saturation on estimates of soil carbon capacity
PY  - 2006
AB  - Rates of soil C sequestration have previously been estimated for a number of different land management activities, and these estimates continue to improve as more data become available. The time over which active sequestration occurs may be referred to as the sequestration duration. Integrating soil C sequestration rates with durations provides estimates of potential change in soil C capacity and more accurate estimates of the potential to sequester C. In agronomic systems, changing from conventional plow tillage to no-till can increase soil C by an estimated 16±3%, whereas increasing rotation intensity can increase soil C by an estimated 6±3%. The increase in soil C following a change in rotation intensity, however, may occur over a slightly longer period (26 yr) than that for tillage cessation (21 yr). Sequestration strategies for grasslands have, on average, longer sequestration durations (33 yr) than for croplands. Estimates for sequestration rates and durations are mean values and can differ greatly between individual sites and management practices. As the annual sequestration rate declines over the sequestration duration period, soil C approaches a new steady state. Sequestration duration is synonymous with the time to which soil C steady state is reached. However, soils could potentially sequester additional C following additional changes in management until the maximum soil C capacity, or soil C saturation, is achieved. Carbon saturation of the soil mineral fraction is not well understood, nor is it readily evident. We provide evidence of soil C saturation and we discuss how the steady state C level and the level of soil C saturation together influence the rate and duration of C sequestration associated with changes in land management.

TI  - Controlling nitrogen flows and losses - Controlling nitrogen flows and losses
PY  - 2004
AB  - This book is a synthesis of contributions drawn from the 12th Nitrogen Workshop held at the University of Exeter, UK. It provides a valuable compilation of current research, aimed at reconciling the environmental and economic components of Nitrogen cycling within the context of a productive agricultural industry. The book is divided into seven main sections, which examine systematically, the nature of the problems associated with losses of Nitrogen and a range of possible solutions. Section 1, &#39;Drivers towards sustainability-why change?&#39; identifies the need to adopt new strategies to avoid losses to the environment. Section 2 considers the options for &#39;Matching supply with demand&#39;, followed by the reasons for, and means of &#39;Controlling losses to air&#39; and to &#39;water&#39; in section 3 and 4. Section 5 describes the challenges of &#39;Reconciling productivity with environmental considerations&#39;. The remaining sections describe some mathematical models to assist the researcher, with the final section devoted to reports from the &#39;Themed Working Groups&#39; which debated the following topical questions: Organic matter: does it matter, or can technology overcome most problems related to soil fertility? Optimising Nitrogen additions: can we integrate fertilizer use and manure use? Controlling gaseous Nitrogen emissions: what is achievable? Missing Nitrogen: is the solution in dissolved Nitrogen? Pollution problems: mitigation, or are we swapping one form of pollution for another? System studies: do we need them, or can they be replaced by desktop studies? Model answers: can we improve their level of confidence and applicability? This book will be of value to researchers, policy makers and all those wishing to promote more efficient use of Nitrogen.

TI  - Methane oxidation in non-flooded soils as affected by crop production — invited paper
PY  - 2001
AB  - Methane is an important greenhouse gas, which contributes approximately 20% to global warming. The atmospheric CH4 concentration is increasing rapidly, resulting from an imbalance between CH4 production and consumption. The only known biological CH4 sinks are soils where methanotrophic bacteria consume CH4 by oxidizing it. For several reasons the CH4 uptake potential, particularly of arable soils and grassland, is only partly exploited, as several agricultural practices have adverse impacts on the activity of the CH4 oxidizing bacteria. The kind of land use in general has a remarkable influence with much higher oxidation rates under forest than under grassland or arable soil. Regular soil cultivation by ploughing and fertilization with ammonium or urea have been identified as main factors. Immediately after ammonium application the methanotrophic enzyme system is blocked, resulting in an inhibition of CH4 oxidation. In addition to this short-term effect a long-term effect exists after repeated ammonium fertilization, which is most likely caused by a shift in the population of soil microbes. Crop residues affect CH4 oxidation differently, depending on their C/N ratio: with a wide C/N ratio no effects are expected, whereas with a narrow C/N ratio strong inhibition was observed. Animal manure, particularly slurry, can cause CH4 emission immediately after application, whereas in the long run farmyard manure does not seem to have adverse impacts on CH4 oxidation. The methanotrophic activity decreased markedly with soil pH, although in many cases liming of acidified soils did not show a positive effect. Arable soils have a rather small pH range which allows CH4 oxidation, and the inhibitory effect of ammonium can partly result from a concomitant decrease in soil pH. Reduced tillage was identified as a measure to improve the methanotrophic activity of arable land, set aside of formerly ploughed soil points into the same direction. Plant growth itself is not primarily responsible for observed effects on CH4 oxidation, but secondary factors like differential pesticide treatments, changes in pH, or cultivation effects are more likely involved. Although for the overall CH4 fluxes the oxidation processes in agricultural soils are of minor importance, all available possibilities should be exhausted to improve or at least preserve their ability to oxidize CH4.

TI  - Soil organic carbon sequestration rates by tillage and crop rotation : A global data analysis
PY  - 2002
AB  - Changes in agricultural management can potentially increase the accumulation rate of soil organic C (SOC), thereby sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere. This study was conducted to quantify potential soil C sequestration rates for different crops in response to decreasing tillage intensity or enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the duration of time over which sequestration may occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were completed using a global database of 67 long-term agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a change from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) can sequester 57 ± 14 g C m -2 yr -1 , excluding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow systems which may not result in SOC accumulation with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation complexity can sequester an average 20 ± 12 g C m -2 yr -1 , excluding a change from continuous corn (Zea mays L.) to corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) which may not result in a significant accumulation of SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20 yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration rates, estimated for a number of individual crops and crop rotations in this study, can be used in spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict regional, national, and global C sequestration potentials.

TI  - Dissolved and Soil Organic Carbon after Long‐Term Conventional and No‐Tillage Sorghum Cropping
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Distribution of dissolved (DOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) with depth may indicate soil and crop‐management effects on subsurface soil C sequestration. The objectives of this study were to investigate impacts of conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and cropping sequence on the depth distribution of DOC, SOC, and total nitrogen (N) for a silty clay loam soil after 20 years of continuous sorghum cropping. Conventional tillage consisted of disking, chiseling, ridging, and residue incorporation into soil, while residues remained on the soil surface for NT. Soil was sampled from six depth intervals ranging from 0 to 105 cm. Tillage effects on DOC and total N were primarily observed at 0–5 cm, whereas cropping sequence effects were observed to 55 cm. Soil organic carbon (C) was higher under NT than CT at 0–5 cm but higher under CT for subsurface soils. Dissolved organic C, SOC, and total N were 37, 36, and 66%, respectively, greater under NT than CT at 0–5 cm, and 171, 659, and 837% greater a...

TI  - Emissions of CO2, N2O, and NO in conventional and no-till management practices in Rondônia, Brazil
PY  - 2003
AB  - Efforts to restore productivity of pastures often employ agricultural management regimes involving either tillage or no-tillage options combined with various combinations of fertilizer application, herbicide use and the planting of a cash crop prior to the planting of forage grasses. Here we report on the emissions of CO2, N2O and NO from the initial phases (first 6 months) of three treatments in central Rondonia. The treatments were (1) control; (2) conventional tillage followed by planting of forage grass (Brachiaria brizantha) and fertilizer additions; (3) no-tillage/herbicide treatment followed by two plantings, the first being a cash crop of rice followed by forage grass. In treatment 3, the rice was fertilized. Relative to the control, tillage increased CO2 emission by 37% over the first 2 months, while the no-tillage/herbicide regime decreased CO2 emissions by 7% over the same period. The cumulative N2O emissions over the first 2 months from the tillage regime (0.94 kg N ha–1) were much higher than the N2O releases from either the no-tillage/herbicide regime (0.64 kg N ha–1) or the control treatment (0.04 kg N ha–1). The highest levels of N2O fluxes from both management regimes were observed following N fertilizations. The cumulative NO releases over the first 2 months were largest in the tillage treatment (0.98 kg N ha–1), intermediate in the no-tillage treatment (0.72 kg N ha–1), and smallest in the control treatment (0.12 kg N ha–1). For the first week following fertilization the percentage of fertilizer N lost as N2O plus NO was 1.0% for the tillage treatment and 3.0% for the no-tillage treatment.

TI  - Climate change impacts on agriculture and soil carbon sequestration potential in the Huang-Hai plain of China
PY  - 2005
AB  - For thousands of years, the Huang-Hai Plain in northeast China has been one of the most productive agricultural regions of the country. The future of this region will be determined in large part by how global climatic changes impact regional conditions and by actions taken to mitigate or adapt to climate change impacts. One potential mitigation strategy is to promote management practices that have the potential to sequester carbon in the soils. The IPCC estimates that 40 Pg of C could be sequestered in cropland soils worldwide over the next several decades; however, changes in global climate may impact this potential. Here, we assess the potential for soil C sequestration with conversion of a conventional till (CT) continuous wheat system to a wheat–corn double cropping system and by implementing no till (NT) management for both continuous wheat and wheat–corn systems. To assess the influence of these management practices under a changing climate, we use two climate change scenarios (A2 and B2) at two time periods in the EPIC agro-ecosystem simulation model. The applied climate change scenarios are from the HadCM3 global climate model for the periods 2015–2045 and 2070–2099 which projects consistent increases in temperature and precipitation of greater than 5 8C and up to 300 mm by 2099. An increase in the variability of temperature is also projected and is, accordingly, applied in the simulations. The EPIC model indicates that winter wheat yields would increase on average by 0.2 Mg ha � 1 in the earlier period and by 0.8 Mg ha � 1 in the later period due to warmer nighttime temperatures and higher precipitation. Simulated yields were not significantly affected by imposed changes in crop management. Simulated soil organic C content was higher under both NT management and double cropping than under CT continuous wheat. The simulated changes in management were a more important factor in SOC changes than the scenario of climate change. Soil C sequestration rates for continuous wheat systems were increased by an average of 0.4 Mg ha � 1 year � 1 by NT in the earlier period and by 0.2 Mg ha � 1 year � 1 in the later period. With wheat–corn double cropping, NT increased sequestration rates by 0.8 and 0.4 Mg ha � 1 year � 1 for the earlier and later periods, respectively. The total C offset due to a shift from CT to NT under continuous wheat over 16 million hectares in the Huang-Hai Plain is projected to reach 240 Tg C in the earlier period and 180 Tg C in the later period. Corresponding C offsets for wheat–corn cropping are 675–495 Tg C. # 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental impacts of grazed clover/grass pastures
PY  - 2009
AB  - Grazed clover/grass pastures are important for animal production systems and the clover component is critical for its contribution to N inputs via biological fixation of atmospheric N 2 . The resource efficiency and environmental emissions for clover/grass pastures can differ from that of N-fertilised grass-only pastures. Fixation of N 2 by clover uses photosynthetically-fixed carbon, whereas fertiliser N production consumes fossil fuels and has net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Clover has a higher phosphorus (P) requirement than grass and where extra P fertiliser is used for clover/grass pastures the risk of P loss to waterways is greater than for grass-only pastures. Nitrogen leaching from grazed pasture increases exponentially with increased N inputs and urinary-N contributes 70 to 90% of total N leaching. However, the few studies comparing clover/grass and N-fertilised grass-only pastures at similar total N inputs indicated similar N leaching losses. Nitrous oxide emissions from grazed pastures due to N-cycling of excreta are similar for clover/grass and N-fertilised grass-only pastures at similar total N inputs. However, grass-only pasture requires the application of N fertiliser, which will result in additional specific losses that don’t occur from clover-fixed N. Thus, total N 2 O emissions are generally higher for N-fertilised grass pastures than for clover/grass pastures. A summary of various whole-system and life cycle assessment analyses for dairy farms from various countries indicated that at similar total N inputs, clover/grass pasture systems can be more efficient than N-fertilised grass systems per kilogram of milk produced from an energy use and GHG perspective whereas results for nutrient losses to waterways were mixed and appear to be similar for both pasture types. In practice, other management practices on farm, such as crop integration, supplementary feeding strategy and winter management, can have a larger overall effect on environmental emissions than whether the N input is derived from fertiliser N or from N 2 fixation.

TI  - Elevated CO2 stimulates N2O emissions in permanent grassland
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract To evaluate climate forcing under increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, feedback effects on greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N 2 O) with a high global warming potential should be taken into account. This requires long-term N 2 O flux measurements because responses to elevated CO 2 may vary throughout annual courses. Here, we present an almost 9 year long continuous N 2 O flux data set from a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) study on an old, N-limited temperate grassland. Prior to the FACE start, N 2 O emissions were not different between plots that were later under ambient (A) and elevated (E) CO 2 treatments, respectively. However, over the entire experimental period (May 1998–December 2006), N 2 O emissions more than doubled under elevated CO 2 (0.90 vs. 2.07 kg N 2 O-N ha −1  y −1 under A and E, respectively). The strongest stimulation occurred during vegetative growth periods in the summer when soil mineral N concentrations were low. This was surprising because based on literature we had expected the highest stimulation of N 2 O emissions due to elevated CO 2 when mineral N concentrations were above background values (e.g. shortly after N application in spring). N 2 O emissions under elevated CO 2 were moderately stimulated during late autumn–winter, including freeze–thaw cycles which occurred in the 8th winter of the experiment. Averaged over the entire experiment, the additional N 2 O emissions caused by elevated CO 2 equaled 4738 kg CO 2 -equivalents ha −1 , corresponding to more than half a ton (546 kg) of CO 2  ha −1 which has to be sequestered annually to balance the CO 2 -induced N 2 O emissions. Without a concomitant increase in C sequestration under rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, temperate grasslands may be converted into greenhouse gas sources by a positive feedback on N 2 O emissions. Our results underline the need to include continuous N 2 O flux measurements in ecosystem-scale CO 2 enrichment experiments.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions in livestock production systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Agriculture is responsible for a significant proportion of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (perhaps 18% globally), and therefore has the potential to contribute to efforts to reduce emissions as a means of minimising the risk of dangerous climate change. The largest contributions to emissions are attributed to ruminant methane production and nitrous oxide from animal waste and fertilised soils. Further, livestock, including ruminants, are an important component of global and Australian food production and there is a growing demand for animal protein sources. At the same time as governments and the community strengthen objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are growing concerns about global food security. This paper provides an overview of a number of options for reducing methane and nitrous oxide emissions from ruminant production systems in Australia, while maintaining productivity to contribute to both objectives. Options include strategies for feed modification, animal breeding and herd management, rumen manipulation and animal waste and fertiliser management. Using currently available strategies, some reductions in emissions can be achieved, but practical commercially available techniques for significant reductions in methane emissions, particularly from extensive livestock production systems, will require greater time and resource investment. Decreases in the levels of emissions from these ruminant systems (i.e., the amount of emissions per unit of product such as meat) have already been achieved. However, the technology has not yet been developed for eliminating production of methane from the rumen of cattle and sheep digesting the cellulose and lignin-rich grasses that make up a large part of the diet of animals grazing natural pastures, particularly in arid and semi-arid grazing lands. Nevertheless, the abatement that can be achieved will contribute significantly towards reaching greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and research will achieve further advances.

TI  - Controls of bioavailability and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter in soils
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract In soils, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is probably the most bioavailable fraction of soil organic matter, since all microbial uptake mechanisms require a water environment. Bioavailability describes the potential of microorganisms to interact with DOM. It is a prerequisite for biodegradation and can be restricted, if DOM is present in small pores or within soil aggregates and therefore not accessible for microorganisms. DOM biodegradation is defined as the utilisation of organic compounds by soil microorganisms quantified by the disappearance of DOM or O2 or by the evolution of CO2. The controlling factors for DOM biodegradability can be divided into three groups, namely, intrinsic DOM quality parameters, soil and solution parameters and external factors. DOM characteristics that generally enhance its biodegradability are high contents of carbohydrates, organic acids and proteins for which the hydrophilic neutral fraction seems to be a good estimate. In contrast, aromatic and hydrophobic structures that can also be assessed by UV absorbance decrease DOM biodegradability, either due to their recalcitrance or due to inhibiting effects on enzyme activity. Effects of solution parameters such as Al, Fe, Ca and heavy metal concentrations on DOM biodegradability have been documented in various studies, however with different, sometimes conflicting results. Inhibitory effects of metals are generally attributed to toxicity of the organic complexes or the free metal ions. In contrast, the enhanced degradability observed in the presence of metal ions may be due to flocculation, as larger structures will provide better attachment for microbial colonies. As degradation is dependent on microbial activity, the composition and density of the microbial population used in the degradation studies also influence biodegradation. Site-specific factors, such as vegetation, land use and seasonality of meteorological parameters control DOM composition and soil and soil solution properties and therefore also affect its biodegradability. The major obstacle for a better understanding of the controls of DOM biodegradability is the lack of a standardised methodology or at least systematic comparisons between the large number of methods used to assess DOM biodegradability.

TI  - N2O and CH4 emissions from soils under conventional and no-till management practices in Goiânia (Cerrados, Brazil)
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are important greenhouse gases (GHG) produced respectively by the naturally occurring microbial processes of incomplete denitrification or nitrification and methanogenesis. Tillage practices and climate affect the release of GHGs. No tillage (DMC) systems may increase CO2–C fixation in soil but also N2O and CH4 emissions. The aim of this article is to question whether the positive effect of a DMC system observed on carbon storage for the topsoil layer in Cerrado soils is offset or not by the N2O and/or CH4 emissions. Two 5-year-old systems, tillage (disc on the first 15 cm called offset: OFF) and a direct-sowing mulch-based crop system (DMC) with an additional cover crop were studied during a cropping cycle. N2O and CH4 fluxes are determined using a closed-chamber, N2O and CO2 concentrations are measured at 3 depths (10-, 20- and 30 cm). No significant difference between treatments was observed for both gases (for emissions and concentrations). Soil N2O contents increase from surface to depth (30 cm) and range from 300 ppbv to 3 ppm for both treatments. Total annual estimated emissions of N2O range from 31 to 35 g N2O–N ha− 1 year− 1 for DMC and OFF respectively which is low and corresponds only to 0.03% of the total N-fertilizer applied. Monthly means N2O emissions were strongly correlated to monthly means of N2O content at 10 cm depth (R2 = 0.66) and seem to increase exponentially with monthly mean Water Filled Pore Space WFPS (0–10 cm layer) (R2 = 0.33). CH4 fluxes were very low as well: both treatment act as source of CH4 (245 and 403 g CH4–C ha− 1 year− 1 for DMC and OFF respectively. On a CO2–C equivalent basis these results correspond to 4.1 and 4.7 kg CO2–C ha− 1 year− 1 for N2O and to 1.9 and 3.1 kg CO2–C ha− 1 year− 1 for CH4 for DMC and OFF respectively. As a result, the carbon sequestration balance taking into account the CO2, CH4 and N2O on a CO2–C equivalent basis is in favour of DMC treatment considering that this treatment increases carbon storage originated from CO2–C for the topsoil (0–10 cm) layer (350 kg C ha− 1 year− 1) in comparison with OFF treatment.

TI  - Effects of feeding fresh white clover (Trifolium repens) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) on enteric methane emissions from sheep
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Enteric CH4 contributes about one third of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions. Measurements from our laboratory using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) technique suggested much lower CH4 yields (as g CH4/kg dry matter (DM) intake) from sheep fed fresh white clover (Trifolium repens) compared with fresh perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Thus, white clover offers an opportunity to reduce CH4 emissions from pastoral based ruminant livestock systems if its lower CH4 yield can be confirmed using respiration chambers. This study was comprised of 2 experiments where good nutritional quality freshly harvested white clover and perennial ryegrass were fed to 16 sheep in Experiment 1 (8/diet) and 32 sheep in Experiment 2 (16/diet). Intakes were about 1.6 times metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance (×MEm) in Experiment 1 and 0.8 × MEm and 2.0 × MEm in Experiment 2 (8/diet/feeding level). In both experiments sheep had a 10 d acclimatization to their diets and CH4 emissions were measured in respiration chambers for 2 consecutive days. Methane yield (g CH4/kg DM intake) was 12% lower (P=0.04) for white clover (19.8) compared with ryegrass fed sheep (22.5) in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, there were no effects of forage on CH4 yield (as g CH4/kg DM intake) at 0.8 × MEm (27.1 and 25.5, respectively) but, at 2.0 × MEm, CH4 yield (as g CH4/kg DM intake) was 7% higher (P=0.05) for white clover (23.4) compared with ryegrass (21.7). Analyses of combined data from both experiments show that there were no overall dietary effects on CH4 yield, but increased intakes reduced CH4 yield (P This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture – Finding a Balance Between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

TI  - The adoption of non-inversion tillage systems in the United Kingdom and the agronomic impact on soil, crops and the environment—A review
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper seeks to review the current knowledge on soil cultivation and its effects to both soil physical properties and consideration to soil management to optimise crop productivity and yield when using non-inversion tillage within the United Kingdom (UK). There are many terms used to describe conservation tillage, more commonly referred to within the UK as non-inversion tillage, but it has generally been defined as any tillage system that maintains at least 30% residue cover on the soil surface after drilling to reduce the risk of soil erosion, conserve soil organic matter and improve soil structural stability. Consideration to a number of important factors needs to be given if successful adoption of non-inversion tillage is to be made in the UK. Soil type can have a substantial influence on the relative success of the adoption of non-inversion tillage. For example, on self-structuring clay soils the system can be relatively well suited and allow for timely cultivations that reduces the risk for creating very dry, cloddy seedbeds following ploughing wet soil that are difficult for establishing a successful crop. However, in contrast some unstructured light sand soils tend not to be suitable for non-inversion tillage because the soil aggregates tend to form an angular structure that fit tightly together excluding the movement of air and water through the soil profile that are fundamental requirements for healthy crop growth. Further agronomic management factors including crop residue handling at harvest and the consideration to weed control strategies that seek to reduce the risk to increasing herbicide resistance, in particular grass weeds, from the use of selective herbicide groups, e.g. sulfonylurea herbicides (e.g. Atlantis). If these factors are carefully managed then the opportunities in reducing fuel use, timeliness of cultivations and improved soil erosion control that non-inversion tillage can offer are potentially of great value in adopting sustainable cultivation strategies for maintaining or improving crop performance in a period of increased economic and environmental uncertainty.

TI  - Dry matter production and nutrient accumulation after successive crops of lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogongrass in a substrate with zeolite
PY  - 2010
AB  - SUMMARY Zeolites are hydrated crystalline aluminosilicate minerals of natural occurrence, structured in rigid third dimension net that can be used as slow release plant-nutrient source. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of plant growth substrate under zeolite application, enriched with N, P and K, on dry matter yield and on nutrient contents in consecutive crops of lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogon grass. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, with 3 kg pots with an inert substrate, evaluated in a randomized block design with three replications. Treatments consisted of four types of enrichment of concentrated natural zeolite: concentrated zeolite (Z) only, zeolite + KNO3 (ZNK), zeolite + K2HPO4 (ZPK) and zeolite + H3PO4 + apatite (ZP), and a control grown in substrate fertilized with a zeolite-free nutrient solution. Four levels of enriched zeolite were tested: 20, 40, 80, and 160 g/pot. Four successive crops were grown on the same substrate in each pot: lettuce, tomato, rice, and andropogon grass. Results indicated that N, P and K enriched zeolite was an adequate slow-release nutrient source for plants. The total dry matter production of above-ground biomass of four successive crops followed a descending order: ZP > ZPK > ZNK > Z.

TI  - A synthesis of carbon sequestration, carbon emissions, and net carbon flux in agriculture: comparing tillage practices in the United States
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract The atmospheric CO 2 concentration is increasing, due primarily to fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. Sequestering atmospheric C in agricultural soils is being advocated as a possibility to partially offset fossil-fuel emissions. Sequestering C in agriculture requires a change in management practices, i.e. efficient use of pesticides, irrigation, and farm machinery. The C emissions associated with a change in practices have not traditionally been incorporated comprehensively into C sequestration analyses. A full C cycle analysis has been completed for agricultural inputs, resulting in estimates of net C flux for three crop types across three tillage intensities. The full C cycle analysis includes estimates of energy use and C emissions for primary fuels, electricity, fertilizers, lime, pesticides, irrigation, seed production, and farm machinery. Total C emissions values were used in conjunction with C sequestration estimates to model net C flux to the atmosphere over time. Based on US average crop inputs, no-till emitted less CO 2 from agricultural operations than did conventional tillage, with 137 and 168 kg C ha −1 per year, respectively. Changing from conventional tillage to no-till is therefore estimated to both enhance C sequestration and decrease CO 2 emissions. While the enhanced C sequestration will continue for a finite time, the reduction in net CO 2 flux to the atmosphere, caused by the reduced fossil-fuel use, can continue indefinitely, as long as the alternative practice is continued. Estimates of net C flux, which are based on US average inputs, will vary across crop type and different climate regimes. The C coefficients calculated for agricultural inputs can be used to estimate C emissions and net C flux on a site-specific basis.

TI  - Simulation of fluxes of greenhouse gases from European grasslands using the DNDC model
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural management of grasslands results in sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs, particularly CO2, N2O and CH4). Here, we used a process-based model (DNDC) to estimate the fluxes of the major GHGs from grasslands at 0.5° resolution across Europe, and combined these to produce a spatially explicit estimate of the total global warming potential (GWP, expressed in CO2 equivalents). The DNDC model [Li, C., Frolking, S., Crocker, G.J., Grace, P.R., Klir, J., Korchens, M., Poulton, P.R., 1997. Simulating trends in soil organic carbon in long-term experiments using the DNDC model. Geoderma 81, 45–60] simulates carbon and nitrogen cycling in agro-ecosystems at a sub-daily time step and consists of four interacting submodels: soil and climate (including water flow and leaching), plant growth, decomposition, and denitrification. Input data sets for grassland area, climate, nitrogen deposition, and soil properties were collated. The typical current grassland management regime was established for ten biogeographical regions on the basis of questionnaires sent to national experts, and used to derive model input data. A 20-year simulation was carried out using DNDC for each site. Simple estimates of methane emissions from grazing livestock were made according to the IPCC Tier 1 method. Most grassland areas are net sources for GHGs in terms of total global warming potential—the beneficial effect of sequestering carbon in soil is outweighed by the emissions of N2O from soil and (predominantly) CH4 emissions from livestock. The net effect of European grasslands on GWP (emission of 23 Tg C year−1) corresponds to a 2.5% increase on the EU-15 fossil fuel CO2 emissions (907 Tg C year−1).

TI  - Effects of residue management and controlled traffic on carbon dioxide and water loss
PY  - 1999
AB  - Management of crop residues and soil organic matter is of primary importance in maintaining soil fertility and productivity and in minimizing agricultural impact on the environment. Our objective was to determine the effects of traffic and tillage on short-term carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) fluxes from a representative soil in the southeastern Coastal Plain (USA). The study was conducted on a Norfolk loamy sand (FAO classification, Luxic Ferralsols; USDA classification, fine-loamy siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudults) cropped to a corn (Zea mays L.) — soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) rotation with a crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) winter cover crop for eight years. Experimental variables were with and without traffic under conventional tillage (CT) (disk harrow twice, chisel plow, field cultivator) and no tillage (NT) arranged in a splitplot design with four replicates. A wide-frame tractive vehicle enabled tillage without wheel traffic. Short-term CO2 and H2O fluxes were measured with a large portable chamber. Gas exchange measurements were made on both CT and NT at various times associated with tillage and irrigation events. Tillage-induced CO2 and H2O fluxes were larger than corresponding fluxes from untilled soil. Irrigation caused the CO2 fluxes to increase rapidly from both tillage systems, suggesting that soil gas fluxes were initially limited by lack of water. Tillage-induced CO2 and H2O fluxes were consistently higher than under NT. Cumulative CO2 flux from CT at the end of 80 h was nearly three times larger than from NT while the corresponding H2O loss was 1.6 times larger. Traffic had no significant effects on the magnitude of CO2 fluxes, possibly reflecting this soil’s natural tendency to reconsolidate. The immediate impact of intensive surface tillage of sandy soils on gaseous carbon loss was larger than traffic effects and suggests a need to develop new management practices for enhanced soil carbon and water management for these sensitive soils. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

PY  - 2001
AB  - There is considerable discussion about the influence of soil management techniques on soil erosion, water use and conservation, and more recently carbon dioxide sequestration and waste disposal. The soil–atmosphere interface, particularly the seed bed layer is of particular concern to agronomists and soil scientists because it is the focus of the physical processes affecting crop establishment and biological activity. This paper evaluates the current knowledge (1) in modeling seedling emergence and residue decomposition, (2) seedbed structure and its resulting physical conditions, and (3) tillage operations affect on seedbed structure and residue distribution.

TI  - Determinants of annual fluxes of CO2 and N2O in long-term no-tillage and conventional tillage systems in northern France
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract The greenhouse gases CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were quantified in a long-term experiment in northern France, in which no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) had been differentiated during 32 years in plots under a maize–wheat rotation. Continuous CO 2 and periodical N 2 O soil emission measurements were performed during two periods: under maize cultivation (April 2003–July 2003) and during the fallow period after wheat harvest (August 2003–March 2004). In order to document the dynamics and importance of these emissions, soil organic C and mineral N, residue decomposition, soil potential for CO 2 emission and climatic data were measured. CO 2 emissions were significantly larger in NT on 53% and in CT on 6% of the days. From April to July 2003 and from November 2003 to March 2004, the cumulated CO 2 emissions did not differ significantly between CT and NT. However, the cumulated CO 2 emissions from August to November 2003 were considerably larger for NT than for CT. Over the entire 331 days of measurement, CT and NT emitted 3160 ± 269 and 4064 ± 138 kg CO 2 -C ha −1 , respectively. The differences in CO 2 emissions in the two tillage systems resulted from the soil climatic conditions and the amounts and location of crop residues and SOM. A large proportion of the CO 2 emissions in NT over the entire measurement period was probably due to the decomposition of old weathered residues. NT tended to emit more N 2 O than CT over the entire measurement period. However differences were statistically significant in only half of the cases due to important variability. N 2 O emissions were generally less than 5 g N ha −1  day −1 , except for a few dates where emission increased up to 21 g N ha −1  day −1 . These N 2 O fluxes represented 0.80 ± 0.15 and 1.32 ± 0.52 kg N 2 O-N ha −1  year −1 for CT and NT, respectively. Depending on the periods, a large part of the N 2 O emissions occurred was probably induced by nitrification, since soil conditions were not favorable for denitrification. Finally, for the period of measurement after 32 years of tillage treatments, the NT system emitted more greenhouses gases (CO 2 and N 2 O) to the atmosphere on an annual basis than the CT system.

TI  - Dissolved organic nitrogen in contrasting agricultural ecosystems
PY  - 2005
AB  - Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is increasingly being recognized as a major component of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, however, the factors that regulate its behaviour in soil remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of agricultural land use on the amount of DON in soil. At 94 sites, representing seven contrasting agricultural land use types, we extracted soil solution during the growing season. DON was high in all land use types constituting 57±8% of the total dissolved N (TDN) pool and generally followed the series

citrus>vegetable>forest=arable>grassland=wetland>heathland.citrus>vegetable>forest=arable>grassland=wetland>heathland.



The TDN pool was dominated by DON in less intensive agricultural systems. In relative contrast to DON, the amount of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) varied widely upon land use with intensive agricultural systems being dominated by NO3− and low input systems dominated by NH4+. We conclude that DON represents a significant N pool in all agroecosystems but its concentration is less sensitive to land use system than DIN.

TI  - Quantitative digestion of fresh herbage by sheep
PY  - 1980
AB  - The utilization by sheep of dietary N provided in high protein, high water content fresh herbages (Ruanui perennial ryegrass, Tama Westerwolds ryegrass, Pitau white clover, and Fakir giant sainfoin at two stages of maturity) was studied at two levels of intake (maintenance and 1·5 maintenance). Feed was provided by constant feeder. Apparent digestibility of N was similar for all herbages ( ca . 85%) except sainfoin which, particularly at a late stage of maturity, was lower (70–80%). A small loss of nitrogen across the stomachs occurred with clover (1–3 g/day) and Tama ryegrass at the higher feeding level (2 g/day), but no loss was observed with the other diets. The apparent digestibility of N and of non-ammonia N (NAN) in the intestines was lower for sainfoin, and estimated true digestibility was also lower. Amino acid N contributed less to the NAN reaching the duodenum on the sainfoin diets than on the grass and clover diets. N retention was negative at the lower level of feeding for ryegrass and clover diets. It was greatest for the sainfoin diets at similar N intakes, so that efficiency of retention of apparently digested N was also greatest for sainfoin. The size of the urea pool, the plasma urea concentration and the urea irreversible loss, using [ 14 C]urea, did not differ significantly between diets at similar N intake. Urea irreversible loss exceeded urinary urea excretion by 35—50% on all but the late-maturity sainfoin diet, where urea irreversible loss was more than double the urinary urea output. These data indicate dietary differences in the extent of degradation of urea on recycling to the gastro-intestinal tract. Urea clearance across the kidney was also lowest for sainfoin. Data are compared in a simple model which illustrates the importance of variable clearance of urea across the kidney and the gut wall and the need for knowledge of factors which control this.

TI  - Alternative temperate forages containing secondary compounds for improving sustainable productivity in grazing ruminants
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract The use of alternative temperate forages to improve the sustainable productivity of grazing ruminants, relative to grass-based pastures, is reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed upon forages containing secondary compounds for sustainable control of internal parasites, for increasing reproductive rate in sheep, reducing bloat risk in cattle and for reducing methane production as a means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Of the forages reviewed, the herb chicory ( Chicorium intybus ) and the condensed tannin-containing legumes Lotus corniculatus L. and sulla ( Hedysarum coronarium ) offered the most advantages. Chicory and sulla promoted faster growth rates in young sheep and deer in the presence of internal parasites, and showed reduced methane production in other studies. L. corniculatus was not as effective as chicory and sulla in promoting growth of lambs in the presence of internal parasites. Grazing on L. corniculatus was associated with increases in reproductive rate in sheep, increases in milk production in both ewes and dairy cows and reduced methane production, effects that were mainly due to its content of condensed tannins (CT). Grazing ewes on L. corniculatus during mating and very early pregnancy may also reduce lamb mortality. However, there are no data on the effect of mating ewes, which are grazing chicory on their reproductive performance, an important omission. Risk of rumen frothy bloat in cattle grazing legumes is reduced when the forage contains 5 g CT/kg dry matter (DM) or greater. Gene transfer techniques aimed at achieving this for lucerne ( Medicago sativa ) have made progress, but CT concentration needs to be further increased from calculated values of 0.75–1.25 g CT/kg DM in the transformed plants. Bloat control may be achievable in genetically transformed legumes before increased amino acid absorption, as the concentration of CT required for bloat control is lower (5 versus 30–40 g/kg DM) than that required to cause increased amino acid absorption and is not affected by differences in CT structure. Key plant characteristics for improved sustainable productivity are a high ratio of readily fermentable: structural carbohydrate and the presence of CT and certain other secondary compounds. Taking into account both nutritional and agronomic considerations, chicory is considered one of the best emerging plants for grazing livestock, with L. corniculatus being more suitable for areas with dry summers and warm winters. Some of the agronomic limitations of L. corniculatus and sulla could be reduced by mechanical harvesting and their inclusion as a component in total mixed rations (TMR), instead of grazing.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from an irrigated soil as affected by fertilizer and straw management
PY  - 2001
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from farmland is a concern for both environmental quality and agricultural productivity. Field experiments were conducted in 1996–1997 to assess soil N2O emissions as affected by timing of N fertilizer application and straw/tillage practices for crop production under irrigation in southern Alberta. The crops were soft wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) in 1996 and canola (Brassica napusL.) in 1997. Nitrous oxide flux from soil was measured using a vented chamber technique and calculated from the increase in concentration with time. Nitrous oxide fluxes for all treatments varied greatly during the year, with the greatest fluxes occurring in association with freeze-thaw events during March and April. Emissions were greater when N fertilizer (100 kg N ha−1) was applied in the fall compared to spring application. Straw removal at harvest in the fall increased N2O emissions when N fertilizer was applied in the fall, but decreased emissions when no fertilizer was applied. Fall plowing also increased N2O emissions compared to spring plowing or direct seeding. The study showed that N2O emissions may be minimized by applying N fertilizer in spring, retaining straw, and incorporating it in spring. The estimates of regional N2O emissions based on a fixed proportion of applied N may be tenuous since N2O emission varied widely depending on straw and fertilizer management practices.

TI  - Effect of tillage practices on the soil carbon dioxide flux during fall and spring seasons in a Mediterranean Vertisol
PY  - 2011
AB  - In this study, we assessed the effect of conventional tillage (CT), reduced (RT) and no tillage (NT) practices on the soil CO2 flux of a Mediterranean Vertisol in semi-arid Morocco. The measurements focused on the short term (0 to 96 h) soil CO2 fluxes measured directly after tillage during the fall and spring period. Soil temperature, moisture and soil strength were measured congruently to study their effect on the soil CO2 flux magnitude. Immediately after fall tillage, the CT showed the highest CO2 flux (4.9 g m-2 h-1); RT exhibited an intermediate value (2.1 g m-2 h-1) whereas the lowest flux (0.7 g m-2 h-1) was reported under NT. After spring tillage, similar but smaller impacts of the tillage practices on soil CO2 flux were reported with fluxes ranging from 1.8 g CO2 m-2 h-1 (CT) to less than 0.1 g CO2 m-2 h-1 (NT). Soil strength was significantly correlated with soil CO2 emission; whereas surface soil temperature and moisture were low correlated to the soil CO2 flux. The intensity of rainfall events before fall and spring tillage practices could explain the seasonal CO2 flux trends. The findings promote conservation tillage and more specifically no tillage practices to reduce CO2 losses within these Mediterranean agro-ecosystems.
