Description: bibfix is an R package (with future plans for a Shiny app) that 
    helps users repair and enrich their bibliographic data. It does so 
    through a suite of functions that request bibliographic data from API 
    services including CrossRef and The Lens.org. Repaired fields can include 
    titles, abstract, unique identifiers (e.g. DOIs), publication years, etc. 
    In addition, bibliographic records can be supplemented with additional 
    information, including internal identifiers for common databases (e.g. 
    The Lens.org, PubMed, Microsoft Academic) that facilitate deduplication, 
    and information such as author affiliations and identifiers (e.g. ORCIDs). 
    The package is a work in progress and is part of the Evidence Synthesis 
    Hackathon.
